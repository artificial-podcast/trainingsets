    Chapter 1: Little NightmareWriter's Notes:This is my first fanfic for the monster musume universe, so if anyone could offer feedback on my writing style it would be much encouraged. That being said, I would be more receptive to those have writing prowess on par with Hemmingway (not really, any critique is good critique). All rights of the Monster Musume franchise belong to their respective creators. This is a non-profit fanfiction.I plan on making the follow the timeline of the original story canon, so expect references here and there. Plus, I may add references and nods to other franchises so again , be on the lookout.I wanted this story to take place in South Central United States, particularly in Northern Alabama (insert Southerner joke here). I know this part of the country well, traveled a lot around much of the South, so the setting would be easy work with. Also, something I've noticed in many of the fanfictions on here is a near absence of African American protagonists. This story is my way of rectifying that, so you don't take my slight grievance at face-value. Also, this chapter contains mature subject matter that may be too much for some readers. Be safe around literature.If you didn't get my little sad attempt at being satirical from the title of this chapter, the first part of the story will focus on my homestay who is a Nightmare ( look up Monster Girl encyclopedia for more info). Now with pleasantries out of the way let's get this show started.Monsters are real. That's what blared on every news outlet in the world seven years ago. To the common man, this sudden declaration could have been the media going insane or some elaborate hoax. But no, Monsters ARE real, and the thing is they aren't monsters at all but people with…unique features. The government had apparently been keeping the existence of these people, Liminals as they've been coined, out of the public eye for the past couple hundred years. How they managed to do this for so long is beyond comprehension but I digress.As soon as the world found out fairy tale and mythical creature were flesh and blood real, the hype was insane. Can you blame them really? It's like everyone's dreams becoming reality—scaly, feathery, slimy, reality. As soon as this craze began, the Japanese government had announced their plan for species integration, think they called it the Interspecies Exchange Act. Essentially, it's a bill that allowed for Liminals of different species to live with humans so that the two species could learn about each other's cultures to build a better understanding of each other. In the first four years, nearly every nation had adopted the Act with offices and agents for exchange students with their own versions of the original Bill. Not surprisingly, the United States was one of the first nations to adopt the Act. Though, there were many who protested the integration of Liminals into human society. However, they were vastly outnumbered and outvoted by the majority of the population. Granted they were mostly made up of members of Geek cultures and general weirdos but any progression is good progression. The laws from the bill the United States had were a bit more lenient, such as the fact that if a Liminal were threatened violently by a human and vice versa they had the right to defend themselves. However, many of these altercations were taken care of by that Liminal neutralization squad, MON I think its called. I swear they ripped that straight from Men in Black.Our story takes place in Southern U.S. in the city of Huntsville, Alabama. Not a bad place to live if I'd say so myself, lots of things to do, plenty of history and such a beautiful botanical gar- whoops started turning into brochure for a minute there. Anyway, it's about time we introduced our lead Caleb Bizzell (that's BI-ZHELL, sorry it's easily mispronounced). Caleb is an African American male in his early twenties, he had a medium build, a little chubby but quite muscular. His hair was black and main styled in a lowcut; he disliked maintaining an afro and had dark brown eyes. He was a pretty even-tempered guy with a caring, supportive, patient and protective personality. Although, he could be quick to anger and a bit stubborn ( traits he was trying to grow out of).He graduated from his university with a Bachelor in Mechanical engineering and he has lived in Alabama most of my life and grew up in Tuscaloosa. He eventually ended up moving to Huntsville after graduating—renting a house and getting entry-level job at a research and technology corporation. He worked with his closest friends on design projects and was normally in charge of materials. Caleb also enjoyed reading, gaming, doing judo, watching anime, building models, and taking walks around town. One of said walks was on my way to the Interspecies Exchange office to check on my application status.It's been about two weeks and he was beginning to wonder if he was denied acceptance. Maybe the government took a look at his not-so-tasteful internet history. After the interspecies Exchange program made it's way to Alabama, he enthusiastically signed up. Mostly because the whole bachelor lifestyle of work and lonely nights started getting to him. Maybe some company will bring a little light back in his life.He checked at his phone and he saw that it's already noon, he had been following his GPS to the Interspecies Exchange office place for 45 minutes now."Damn how far is this place?", he complained and like clockwork the feminine voice of my torment advised a left to turn down the block and you will be at your destination.A sigh of relief escaped his lips as he approached the he hoped air-conditioned building. Why did he choose to walk in 80 degree heat instead of driving l? Because you're an idiot, you needed the exercise but you didn't expect it to be this far did you, jackass?, he thought as he berated himself.The building was an average-looking three-story complex with large tinted glass windows and a contemporary pearl-white fountain near the entrance. As soon as Caleb entered, he was greeted with a sight of a variety of Liminals, most of which he had seen on tv or news websites. Several harpy species, lamia, lizardmen, ogres, kobolds, and even Arachne made up most of the cavalcade of charm and the atmosphere in the room filled with excitement. And the best part, all of the Liminals there were drop dead gorgeous. He made his way to the front check-in station of the building to see a young woman just waving goodbye to a man and a very tall, blue-skinned woman with horns."Hello sir, welcome to the Interspecies Exchange Office, how may I help you?", the young woman said as Caleb made his way to the desk."I'm here to check on my application to the interspecies exchange program. My name is Caleb Bizzell, my pin number is 47-7797"After stating that last part, she quickly typed at her computer looking for his information. "Oh, yes sir, we see that you applied two weeks?" she asked apparently, to which he nodded."Yes, we are sorry, our office has been busy with managing an extremely high volume of homestay requests. We are still processing many of them, but it says here your application was approved a few days ago."A huge sense of relief blew over Caleb as soon as he heard that last part. "Seriously, a few DAYS ago and not even an email? Well I guess it made a lot of sense why it took so long to get a response, this IS the only office branch in Alabama.", Caleb thought trying his best not to appear impatient."We've gotten your request information and reviewed your physical and psychological test results.", she continued, "we've matched you with a homestay that fits your criteria from the questionnaire you answered"."God don't remind me, took nearly three hours to fill that thing out", Caleb ruminated as he remembered the long list of over 60 questions that were asked on the online questionnaire, more than half required 300-word responses. Then again at least the program thorough to account for everyone's individual preferences."Alright Mr. Bizzell, please continue down that hallway and it's the second door at the right to Agent Sterling, he will be your coordinator for the duration of the program".Caleb thanked her and continued as directed to the coordinator's office. As he walked down the hall he noticed an office filled with liminal and human workers filling out forms and organizing documents. A few of the liminals required assistance to which the staff gladly helped."Quite a sight isn't it?", said a rugged voice that nearly mad Caleb jump from surprise.He turned to see a man, possibly in his forties, with blue eyes and slick back brown hair standing next to him in a black suit, blue tie and white button-down shirt."Y-Yeah, it is.", Caleb managed to utter."We've come quite a long way in only a few years." The man looked off for a second before Caleb interrupted "Are you Agent Sterling, my coordinator?"."That's me and you must be Caleb Bissel, Rebecca from the front desk told me about you. It's a pleasure".Caleb gave an exasperated sigh "It's Bizzell and the pleasure is mine Sir", Caleb stated the last part as politely he could.The two shook hands and Agent Sterling directed Caleb to his office. The two sat down and Agent Sterling began to pour solid record himself a shot of bourbon before sitting down going over Caleb's files and background. Was he really drinking in the middle of the day and at work?"Well , you seem to have a good education, a steady career, no prior criminal record, physical and psychological results all positive." The man continued to read over his profile and sipping his drink, then suddenly raised an eyebrow and glanced up with a smug grin "Oooh a single guy too. Figured a stud like you would be wearing the ladies like a scarf".Caleb felt his face flush a bit at this sudden comment. "S-so what? There's nothing wrong with living alone."Agent Sterling chuckled at his reaction but never broke eye contact. "So why did you sign up to be a host?".Caleb thought for a second, "well…I just wanted to do some good by helping someone adjust to a new life. Plus, well, I have to admit it gets pretty lonely sometimes in a big house."Agent Sterling, appearing satisfied with his answer, continued reading his files. "I noticed that you only have one emergency contact, an Andrew Jr.?".Caleb nodded, "yes, that's my uncle. He lives close by from my house.""Ok but our program requires a minimum of three emergency contacts. We've had cases where were unable to reach hosts in critical situations. Don't you have other relatives you can reach?" The agent continued.Caleb looked down with a despondent expression. "well….after both our parents died…my siblings and I had something of a falling out. I haven't spoken to any of them in three years now. Most of our family never really had much to do with us before and after the funeral. Uncle Andrew was the only one who supported me while I was still in college."The atmosphere in the room felt a bit heavier along with an awkward silence that lasted a few minutes."I'm…so sorry to hear", Agent Sterling stated apologetically feeling a bit ashamed for prodding. "It must have been hard on you—"."It's fine" He was quickly cut off by Caleb who refused to hear the same sympathetic speech he's heard from anyone he told that too for the past couple years. "It's fine, the past is the past and this is the present.", Caleb gave Agent Sterling a reassuring smiling.The Agent looked at his information one last time before placing them all down in a neat stack and taking a couple sheets of paper from a manila folder."Alright then. well Mr. Bizzell, you are all set. I just need you to sign these liability forms certifying your status as a host family of the Interspecies Exchange International. Upon signing, you accept you are responsible for the welfare and safety of your homestay and to abide by the laws of the Exchange act. Failure to do so is equitable to criminal offense and can lead time in prison.", explained Agent Sterling.Caleb finished signing the last of the forms and handed them all the Agent Sterling who then placed them back into the manila folder. "Thank you Mr. Bizzell, welcome to the Interspecies Exchange program", the two shook hands with delighted smiles plastered on their faces."So when do I meet my homestay?", Caleb asked his excitement slowly building.Agent Sterling checked at his computer. "Ah, they should be arriving at your residence in a few minutes. Why don't you ride along with me and I'll introduce them."Caleb seemed relieved to hear that, especially since it meant he wouldn't have to walk home now, Seriously goddamn his need for exercise.It was a pretty laidback ride back home as they drove through the lively town with people going about their daily lives. Agent Sterling spent most of the time explaining a little about the homestay that will be living with Caleb."A…Nightmare?", is what Caleb stated a bit puzzled. What even is a Nightmare?"Yes, is that a problem. I would really hate for it to be. Considering how arduous it was finding someone to take her in", Agent Sterling stated as he glared a malign look at the young man."No, not at all. I just asked because I don't really know what a Nightmare is. Is it some species of Arachne or Kobold?", Caleb explained meekly."Not…exactly, the name is a understandably misleading though. They are essentially a member of the Centaur race. Though they tend to be a bit more withdrawn compared to their warrior-like cousins. Also, they are very timid, so be careful not to surprise her too much." The agent finished explaining as Caleb noticed his home with brown tiled roof and beige-colored outer walls was in viewing distance.It was right across the street from an apartment complex that housed many Liminal families, it was a common sight around here to see hosts out with their houseguests. There's plenty to do around here, lots of restaurants, a movie theatre, a botanical garden a mile down the street, and a beautiful park. A common spot for Caleb's walks. They finally arrived at Caleb's house to find a black conspicuous looking van with two men dressed in a similar fashion to Agent Sterling.They parked on the adjacent side of the street so that the van could still drive out. The two men greeted Sterling and informed him all that all renovations had been completed."Renovation? What renovation?!", Caleb thought as a sense of worry crept up on him.The two got out of the car and Sterling thanked the two men, while Caleb was awe-struck by his house that was now twice its original size."Um, what is this? What happened to my house? How much did this cost, I can't afford this? jesus, what am I going to tell my landlord", Caleb panicked slowly starting to anticipate his future debt.Sterling walked up to distressed Caleb taking a drink from his flask, "Ah geez, will you calm down we've already informed you landlord about your status as a host and all expenses have been paid for renevations to your home. Don't have a heart-attack before meeting you house guest."And just like that, a sense of relief came upon Caleb like a tsunami made of Advil."oh thank God, I thought I might need to take up a second job", Caleb stated as a thought occurred to him. "Speaking of, where is my house guest?"The question struck a chord with agent Sterling as he just remembered what they were doing. "Right, right. She's in the back of the van. Let's introduce you two."The two men from earlier placed a large aluminum platform ramp at back doors of the van, one of them opened the doors. Outstepped, rather cautiously, a young woman with lavender hair, violet eyes, slender but curvy frame, and an ample pair of breasts. She wore a purple zip-up sweatshirt hoodie with a black sailor moon t-shirt underneath. But her most apparent feature was that her lower-half was of that of a horse…well more like a pony…with violet colored fur, dark purple hooves, and a light purple tail with a black bow tied at the end. All Caleb could think was "Sweet baby jesus, she's beautiful." As she stepped out of the van and walked toward to Agent Sterling, Caleb couldn't help but notice how she was only a couple inches taller than him and every movement she made looked like she was walking through a minefield."Mr. Bizzell, I would like you to meet your homestay for the duration of the program.", Sterling then directed her to face Caleb direction. "Please, Miss introduce yourself.""H…hello. M-my name is Mirabelle. Mirabelle Marequine", the young centaur spoke softly in a noticeable English accent."Hello Ma'am, I'm Caleb. Caleb Bizzell. So nice to finally meet you", Caleb stated smiling cheerfully and outstretched his arm for a handshake. She slowly took brought her hand to his to which Caleb lightly squeezed causing her to jump visibly. This girl was definitely on-edge, Caleb tried to think of something to say to put her more at ease.Sterling then approached Caleb from his left "Well, now that you're acquainted, I leave her in your care Mr. Bizzell. Here is care package with all of her information, diet plan, and health information." He paused and gestured to guys from earlier "Also those two informed me that the room they installed for her is directly adjacent from yours". As he spoke one of the guys carried her bags into Caleb's house. She didn't seem to bring much, just a couple suitcases. Did she figure she wasn't staying very long?He pulled Caleb off to the side. "I am required to inform you that any sexually relations between hosts and homestays is a criminal offense. And is punishable by life sentence in prison. So, keep it in your pants partner.", He said with a hint of venom in tone"I- I wouldn't dream of it sir. I'm not that kind of guy.", Caleb manage to choke out obviously flustered. Sterling nodded and gave him an approving pat on the back.Caleb took the care package from Sterling and waved him off as he and the guys in the black van left out of his driveway. Caleb turned to see Mirabelle who had been quietly looking down. He then motioned over her and held the front door open."Welcome, Ms. Marequine, to your new home", He spoke in a regal tone with a bow, "Please step right in". He sweat dropped as he realized how much he was over-doing it.Caleb couldn't be sure, but he thought he heard the faint sound of a giggle as the centaur walk passed him into the house. He went into his house as his eyes widened and his jaw dropped to the linoleum tiled floor. He felt like he was in a mansion, like if about 70 people could fit in there no problem. His living room with its mahogany coffee table, burgundy couch with matching recliner and ottoman was large enough to accompany 10 people. A flat screen with a satellite box sitting on an entertainment center where he kept both his PS4s and games. He glanced around and noticed that his kitchen and dining room were three times bigger. Some of the chairs at the table looked more like a combination of stool and stepladder. Likely to accommodate Mirabelle's body type.Mirabelle looked around the room examining the layout and furniture in the house. Caleb placed the package on the marble countertop in the kitchen and went over to help her with her suitcases."Ahem, how I give you a little tour of the house?", he said regaining his composure."Oh…um yes that would be perfect.", Mirabelle stated in soft tone.Caleb went throughout the house showing her all the rooms, including the one his office where he works on design projects. After getting to the bathroom, he noticed how it was transformed from a small space with a toilet and a shower to an enormous bath house like ones in Japan. The bath tub was the size of a family pool. It was quite the daunting experience. There was another small room inside with all his bathroom items sitting a corner of a huge mirror. His shaving kit, shampoos, and body washes were all there. Caleb showed her the spacious backyard with a tall wrought iron fence around the perimeter. Caleb noticed how Mirabelle was examining the yard, noticeably how she used her front hoof to upturn a small patch of soil as if examining it. Eventually the two made their way to the bedrooms. Caleb managed to locate Mirabelle's as it was the last door on the left of the hallway just next to his office."Alright this looks like your room", He placed he suitcases near the entranced and opened the door. Mirabelle stood a couple feet behind him as she looked at her bedroom. It was designed liked the inside of Britannia chamber with magenta colored cobblestone walls, a beautifully carved wooden dresser, large oval mirror with a stand encrusted in silver, a large closet, and a queen-sized bed with cotton blankets and pillows that had been built into the floor."Hot damn, I think we just stumbled into a Disney princess movie. What do you think Ms. Mar—",Caleb stopped mid-sentence as he noticed her sullen expression."Hey, are you alright?", He said growing concerned, "We can let Sterling know you don't like it.""No, No I love it. I'm just tired that's all and just want to rest.", she explained trying to force a smile."Happy to hear that. Now you get unpacked and I'll go get started on dinner. Come on at the table when everything is ready.", He said with a sweet smile plastered on his face. Mirabelle looked away from him as if pondering about something. "That won't be necessary. I already packed my own food for the night", she quickly said while pulling out a container from suitcase and a bag full of assorted snacks; mostly honey oats bars and wheat cracker."O-Okay then, do you need anything to drink? Some water? A smoothie?", he said with a humble tone."N-no, I have enough water as well. Thank you anyway. So…could you please leave me alone for a while.", she said in a somewhat frightened tone still avoiding eye contact."Alright, I'll just—" before Caleb could say anything she had closed the door on him. With nothing else to do, Caleb went and made himself dinner, did one last check-up on the details to a new project.A few hours later it was nighttime and Caleb decided to check up on Mirabelle. He knocked at her door but heard no response. "Ms. Marequine, are you ok? I just wanted to see how you were doing.""I'm fine." A soft voice said, "I've been busy putting my things away." Caleb continued "Are enjoying you stay?" There was another silence before Mirabelle said "Yes…I like it here. Really."Feeling satisfied with the answer Caleb stepped back from the door and said "Alrighty, If you need anything at all I'm right next door. I am your host after all""for how long though I wonder", Mirabelle muttered softly."Oh did you say something?", Caleb asked to which Mirabelle slightly squeaked out "N-N-No, I said nothing! Nothing at all!""Well ok, remember just holler", with that Caleb stepped down the hallway to his room and close the door. Mirabelle who was listening looked out of her window into the sky thinking to herself 'It's almost time. I'll find out his true nature and motives soon.'Welp that's the end of this chapter, kinda wanted to end on a mysterious not so expect a bit of Mirabelle's backstory next chapter. I just wanted to flesh out the world a bit, you know just introduce the core characters and such.I promise I'll be introducing more characters mainly one's from the corporation Caleb works at and a few more house guests. But I think things are coming out nicely.Peace Fam!

    Chapter 2: Dream on, Dream onWriter's Notes:Well here's chapter 2, hopefully we can get a better look into Mirabelle's history. Hopefully Caleb will be able to reach her past the walls she's put up.This chapter contains mature subject matter, blah, blah, blah, read at your own risk.The next morning came as quickly as the night. As the sun shined down on this sure to be a pleasant Saturday, Caleb was getting out of bed preparing to start his first day as a host. But before he got out of bed he began to remember a rather unusual he had the previous night.The Dream:He was standing in the middle of a room. There was nothing in it but greyness and a light fog. He began to walk for what felt like an eternity as he contemplated his whereabouts, when suddenly he noticed a large purple couch in the middle of the floor. Exhausted from walking, he decided to sit down and rest, still trying to figure out how he ended up here. He turned his head and nearly jumped out of his skin when he saw a woman from out of nowhere sitting next to him. She had deep lavender hair wore a lovely purple satin sleeveless dress with a black waist strap that, not only gave her hips and large breast a voluptuous physique, but accentuated her long, curvaceous legs. She wore no shoe or socks. As she sat, crossing her legs and sitting up straight, she spoke in soft but seductive voice. "Tell me the truth", She began."If you do, you can indulge yourself as much you want with me." She then scooted over into Caleb's lap and began grinding on him. Caleb was confused but didn't object to her actions."You're disgusted by her, aren't you?". Caleb tried listening to this sudden question but was too enthralled with her movements but managed to retort. "Uh, no. Who are you talking about?". She put her face to his ear and began nibbling the lobe before whispering. "Oh come on, you can tell me. The second she stepped out of the van you saw her as some filthy riding animal with a human face. Am I right?" Caleb suddenly snapped out of the trance, grabbing her hips and moving her off his lap. "What are talking about?! I don't think of anyone as an animal." The woman stopped her grinding. "Cut the bullshit, the second you saw her, you wanted her out of your sight, didn't you?!" Caleb, becoming annoyed stood up from the couch. "Look I don't know who you're tallking about but. Why would I get rid of someone when I don't even know them?". The mystery woman stood up as well, clearly becoming agitated. "You're lying, I don't know how but you are. All you humans lie it's what you are all best at." Caleb stood bewildered by her random outburst. What is this woman talking about? Who is she talking about? "The food.", the woman spoke almost to a growl. Caleb looking at her questionably. "What were plan on doing to it? Did you put any drugs in it? What were you planning to do once she was knocked out?", she spoke angrily while becoming teary eyed. Caleb, shocked from her accusation, spoke up abruptly. "No. Why the hell would I do that? Are you fucking insane?!" The woman, tears rolling down her eyes "Y-you're all horrible. You just see us as animals." Caleb feeling guilty and concerned reached out to try and console the crying woman, she jumped back in response. But not before looking at Caleb and his worried expression. She turned and ran and Caleb went after her but she was too fast and he easily lost sight of her. Before Caleb saw a finally glimpse of her in the distance, he noticed how her form had changed a bit, her rear almost looked like that of a horse.Dream End:"I gotta stop eating sweet potato pie before bed, it gives me weird dreams", sighed Caleb coming out of the shower with his blue bathrobe on. He then put on the clothes he had previously laid out; A black pokemon shirt, blue jeans, dark brown belt, and brown converse sneaker. Caleb made his way over to Mirabelle's room and knocked at the door."Good morning, sleepyhead.", he chimed joyfully. "I'm about to get breakfast started come on out when you're ready"."A-Alright, I'll be out soon", Mirabelle said softly as the sound of hooves tapping against the floor could be heard.With that, Caleb went into his now stupidly big kitchen and looked in his refrigerator for the ingredients he sought. He had already read over Mirabelle's diet plan as it most detailed her vegetarian needs. It was good thing he had went shopping the day before, so his culinary repertoire was fully stocked.Thirty minutes had passed and Caleb was finishing up his last dish. It was at the moment when the young Nightmare came walking…trodding?...yeah no, walking into the dining room. She had on an indigo tank top and purple bolero jacket covering it. She wore long purple cape-like cloth covering the top portion of her horse half. In her hair was a crescent moon accessory pinned on the side.No sooner than the scent of the delicious meal hit her nostrils, Mirabelle stood staring in complete befuddlement at the feast presented before her. A plate of crispy hashbrowns, English muffins, freshly made whole wheat pancake with sliced banana on top, and vegetable breakfast burritos lay out on the IKEA table. Being a bachelor for so long has its perks, one of them learning to cook for yourself.Now feeling a drool coming on Mirabelle blush in embarrassment as her stomach growled. "What is all of this? Did…did he really make all of this…for me", Mirabellethought incredulously. Caleb who had heard the noise and lightly giggled, "ah, Ms. Marequine, you're up. I'll be there in a minute you can go ahead and start without me".Mirabelle looked at her host dumbstruck as she finally asked, "Um…Mr. Bizzell…What…what is this?". She paused waiting for his response."Well…short answer…breakfast. Long answer, hash browns, muffins, pancakes—", he stopped when he saw her questioning look. "Oh, is there something wrong. You want me to make you something else?".Mirabelle shook her head frantically. "oh, no, no, no. Everything is fine, it all looks delicious". A little too delicious. She thought."Ok, welp have a seat and dig in before everything gets cold.", Caleb giggle with a toothy grin while handing her a plate with a fork and butter knife.Mirabelle, feeling a bit wary, walked to the side of the table and took one of her specially designed seat and placed her full bottom portion on it. Her waste was close enough to the table edge that could reach everything. She looked at the food cautiously almost deciding which would be safest to eat. She decided to start with the hash browns and took a small portion onto her plate. She took a bite and immediately lit up in delight at the taste of the crispy spuds. It's incredible. So crunchy and rich, she thought with a content look as she munched on the potatoes."hehe good right.", Caleb said walking up to the table. Mirabelle snapped out of her trance and looked at the man with an embarrassed grin. Caleb walked over and placed a cup of orange juice on his and her side of the table. He then took a seat on the opposite end right in from of Mirabelle. "I wasn't sure if you liked whole wheat pancakes or not hell not many people do. So, I just said go for it.", He said with a shrug. She eyed the pancakes suspiciously "What's that aroma coming from the pancakes it smells…robust?". "Oh that's cinnamon, thought the taste would give them an extra kick", Caleb said with grin. Mirabelle took a bite of her pancake and hummed lowly at the tasty fluffy treat. it's delicious, so soft and warm. Caleb smiled at the blushing face of the centaur."So how did enjoy your first night's sleep at Castle Caleb?", he said in a joking tone.Mirabelle stopped eating as a sense of concern began to grow within her. "I-I slept well. Why do you ask?" She looked up at him, scanning his face for something."I just wanted to make sure you're comfortable. I can imagine it'd be hard falling asleep in a house with someone you barely know.", Caleb explained.Mirabelle looked at him and was startled that she found no hint of falsehood in his expression. "O-Oh. So how did you sleep?", she looked, now a bit cautious."Pretty good, had a weird dream though, but t I'm sure it was just the sweet potato pie.", he said plainly. Sweet potato pie? Mirabelle thought tilting her head before asking "What was it about?""Something about a woman who kept asking me strange questions. In short, she just kind of broke down into a fit and I tried to console her but she ran away. I actually felt really sad for her…she looked so…hurt", Caleb stated in a remorseful tone a tear forming in his eye which he wiped away.After hearing his answer, Mirabelle felt a sense of warmth com over her at his answer. How can he be so kind? There has to be ploy, he must be up to something. Her thought was interrupted when Caleb, just pulling himself together, asked "So…do you have anything planned for today?"Mirabelle jumped up and sat for a few seconds at his sudden question before looking down nervously. "N-no, I don't. Why do you ask?""Well I just thought we could go out today so I can show you around town. I don't have work again until Monday and It's kinda part of my job to teach you about my culture." Caleb said about to finish the last of his juice."Oh…well…um…" Mirabelle stuttered trying to find out how to respond."I mean", Caleb continued, "You must have been so nervous when you first came here. I know it can be overwhelming coming to a new country you know next to nothing about. I just want to help you adjust as best as I can."Mirabelle looked at Caleb with a slight sparkle in her eyes at his kind words and concern, but quickly shook it off and looked off to her side. "O-Okay. I'll go"Caleb lit up happily, "Awesome, I know the perfect place to start."Mirabelle continued to look away and nodded, a small smile started to grow on her face.An hour later after breakfast and Caleb was just finishing the dishes. Any leftovers from breakfast were put away in the fridge. As Mirabelle was getting ready for her little tour with Caleb.I wonder where we should go first. Well the botanical garden is close by maybe I'll take her there. Caleb pondered as he placed the silverware into their drawers. At the same time, Mirabelle approached the counter withher violet colored shoulder bag with a floral pattern."Oh, ready to go?", Caleb asked with a small grin."Yes, I just needed a few things", Mirabelle said warily looking at Caleb."You look great by the way, especially that hairpin. You must be a sailor moon fan.", He said innocently causing Mirabelle to blush at his compliment. "Oh th-thank you and yes I really like the show."Caleb took his keys off the counter and placed his wallet in his back buttoned pocket. He opened the front door and allowed for Mirabelle to pass through first, he then turned and locked the doors."Alright away we go, first stop, the botanical gardens", Caleb stated in a jolly manner, warranting a confused look from Mirabelle. "What is this botanical garden?""Oh, you'll love it, trust me, I'll explain more on the way it looks like our ride is here.", Caleb said pointing at the approaching bus-like vehicle. In it, several humans and Extraspecies were riding on it. It was a cluster of serpent tail, horn, claws, and various other features hanging partially exposed on the outer sides. Mirabelle looked on with an awestruck gaze. "Good thing that care package came with a phone number to an Extraspecies trolley. Seriously, a trolley made to accommodate all Liminal species? That's freakin awesome.", Caleb explained a bit too enthusiastically.The boarded the trolley saying good morning to the other Liminals and their hosts. Caleb found a convertible seat and followed the instructions on the overhead to fit Mirabelle's body type. She contently sat down as Caleb took his seat. Caleb explained to her about the botanical garden and its cultural significance in the Huntsville. She seemed to be very interested in all the information he gave her. However, Caleb could feel something was off about the way she talked. As if she was forcing everything she said.They had finally arrived at the botanical garden and got off the trolley, along with a few passengers, at the front entrance. Caleb looked at the various Extraspecies and their host families that were in the area. As he and Mirabelle walked inside, he noticed how she kept keeping a certain distance away from him."Hey Ms. Mirabelle", He said causing her to snap her head up at attention, "Why are you walking so far behind?"Um…we're in public…so…", she trailed offCaleb stepped to her side and took her hand causing her to squeal. "W-W-W-What are you doing Mr. Bizzell, people will see you with me.""What's wrong with that?", He questioned causing her to give a surprised expression, "…Do you not want…to be seen with me?"Mirabelle looked at his growing somber face and quickly tried to diffuse the tension. "N-No, that's not it at all. It's just…I had a host that…he…didn't like me walking with him in public. He would always tell me before going out that he would hurt if I ever got to close to him.", she finished as her shoulder slumped.Caleb agitated at the thought of someone doing that to her, "Well he was an asshole. I ain't even gonna fathom someone being that damn stupid."She looked up at him with bright sparkling eyes. Caleb brought her hand clasped in his up to her face. "I for one enjoy your company". Her eyes grew wide in surprise as Caleb gave her a reassuring smile. "Now, how about I show you a piece of Alabama pride?" Mirabelle giggled with a small smile "I'd like that".The rest of their time there was spent viewing the gorgeously themed gardens with various wildflowers native to Alabama. Caleb explained the uniqueness of each native flower (at least all he knew from Google searches) to Mirabelle who seemed to really enjoy the large patch of lavender flowers, so Caleb bought her some in a vase at a souvenir stand. Her face lit up in delight at their scent. The two walked around the woodland nature trail enjoying the pleasant scenery. Throughout the walk Caleb could feel that Mirabelle wasn't very engaged in the conversation. Everything he said she responded with a "ok or an 'mhmm'". At one point thought they came across a bunch of freshwater turtles near the edge of a bridge they were on. Mirabelle cooed at how adorable they were. It delighted Caleb to see her show genuine interest in something on the tour. It wasn't long before hunger began to set in so they found the closest indoor café to take a break. Luckily, the cafe seemed to accommodate Liminals and the two found a table with convertible chairs for Mirabelle to sit in. There were not many people in the café aside from a couple of hosts and their homestays and four other individuals."Wooo man I'm beat, I swear this place just gets bigger every time I come here", Caleb fanned himself with his hand trying to cool down. "Are you hot too?""Yes, very.", Mirabelle spoke between her chin resting her head on the table.Caleb motion over to the waitress. The young woman came over to their table gave them their menus. "I'll have the smoky mountain chicken and a Diet dr. pepper. What about you Ms. Mariequine?"Mirabelle looked up from her menu "Um I will have large order of Asian salad, two slices of blueberry cheesecake, and a large peach tea.""Alright, how will you be paying?", said the young waitress"Credit", Caleb took out his credit card which she swiped at the counter"Alright thank you, we will have your meals out shortly", Said the waitress as she gave Caleb back his card and left the two alone.Caleb looked at Mirabelle with a content look "You are going to love the salad here, it is just heavenly."Mirabelle just looked at Caleb as if examining him "Mmhmm""So those turtles were cute right? I would have loved to take one home, I think I would have named him…Sheldon. Get it?", he giggled at his pun.Mirabelle just continued looking at Caleb contemplatively "mmmm"Caleb slowly growing concerned "Is there something wrong? You're acting a bit distant?""Why are you doing all of this?". She asked plainlyCaleb confused by what she meant "All of what?""All of THIS.", She stated waving her hand across then stopping at the vase of flowers, "The breakfast? This trip? The flower? And now you're buying me lunch?". She paused and looked down at he clasped together hands "What do you want from me?""Nothing. Maybe I'll think of something later on but not right now.", Caleb answered looking her in the eyes."I…I don't understand. Why would be so nice to me for no reason?", she asked"Who says I need a reason to be nice?", he questioned. She looked on at him astonishment. "I wanted to do these things with you Ms. Marequine; show you my culture, walk with you, talk with you, buy you flowers, cook for you. And before you get the wrong idea it's not just because it's my job as a host, I did it because…well…we're friends. Aren't we?"Mirabelle was speechless. She simply stared at the young man mouth agate eyes blinking in surprise. "I want to be your friend at least, I guess I overdid things a bit. But then again, I always liked to go above and beyond people", he said scratching the back of his head. Mirabelle smiled back at him "I'd love to" Caleb looked at her in surprise. "I'd love to be friends with you Mr. Bizzell." "Please, you can call me 'Caleb'.", he said with a smile. Mirabelle gave a playful smirk "Well, then it's only fair that you now refer to me as 'Mirabelle'". Caleb giggled at her sudden cuteness, "Oh ma'am I do declare, it is so nice to see a 'real' smile on that beautiful face". Mirabelle blushed heavily at his comment "a-and you're a bit of a charmer.""Here are your orders', the waitress said from out of nowhere easily startling Mirabelle into flinching.The waitress set Caleb's smoky mountain chicken dinner in front of him. A platter of barbecue chicken, mashed potatoes, butternut squash, and cheese broccoli covered his plate. Next was Mirabelle's, a bowl full of salad with spring lettuce, cabbage, carrots, radish, sugar snap peas, and mandarin orange. Along with two slices of blue berry cheesecake at her side. Mirabelle visibly drooled and began to dig into her meal with a look of utter content. Caleb did the same and enjoyed the delicious tender meat and sweet squash.After a few minutes of eating in silence Mirabelle halted her veggie assault and looked up at Caleb who was still working on his broccoli."Um, Caleb?" ,She asked catching his attention. He wiped his mouth with a napkin and looked up at her. "Yeah?""I-I want to start over?", Maribelle stated shifting in her seat."Start what over?". Caleb asked puzzled."Our relationship. I feel like we didn't exactly get off on the right foot and I want to get to know you better now.", she said with a hint of remorse.Caleb took a sip of his drink "Alright then, what do you want to know?""Oh…um….well…what do you do for a living?", she asked taking in a mouthful of cabbage and carrot."I work as a designer for an engineering firm. We're currently working on a new type of turbine that could help increase energy production in powerplant generators", Caleb explained taking another drink of soda."Wow, that sounds amazing. So you're an engineer? You must be really smart.", Mirabelle stated her eyes wide with admiration.Caleb waved off the complement "eh some of the math can get crazy every now and again but it's a rewarding experience when you see the finished product. I've done about 8 projects since I started working there.""I bet it gets tiring from time to time.", she stated sipping her tea."Every now and again. But I only work Monday through Thursday 9 to 6, so those weekends are a godsend. Unless project manager is a dick and dumps some specs for us to analyze", Caleb explained with an annoyed tone."Ah, so what do you like to do for fun?", Mirabelle asked blissfully"I like reading, building models, watching anime, and gaming. Currently enjoying Dragonball Fighterz, I'll show you how to play some time.", Caleb said finishing the rest of his chicken."Ah that would be lovely, I don't think I've played a video game before. However, I've heard stories about them from other liminal homestays.", she explained with a slight giggle.Caleb cleared his throat and looked at Mirabelle, "Alright now it's my turn to ask about you.". Mirabelle's eyes widened with curiosity"What do you like to do for fun?", he asked"Well…I Iike to read, mostly fantasy and I don't like horror. I enjoy gardening, my mother always said my thumb was so green it could rival a Driad.", she laughed which made Caleb laugh with her. "I also love collecting Sailor Moon figurines.", She said with a blank expression."Huh, I had a feeling you were a fan of the franchise.", Caleb stated with an impassive expression"Odd, usually whenever I tell anyone that they burst out into laughter and say something like 'are you kidding? You're into that dorky crap?'", She grimaced as she took a bite of her cheesecake."Ugh, I hate it when people do that. It's like our passions and interests are a complete joke to them. You wouldn't believe the shit I got when I wore my Pokemon belt to work.", He said with a scowl. "But how many figurines do you have?""I've got 29 in total", she said with a supercilious tone to which Caleb rolled his eyes. "I only brought 8 with me when I first moved in though. I can ask Agent Sterling to have the rest delivered to me along with some of my other things".Caleb looked at her with a bemused expression, "Why didn't bring everything with you when you moved in? Did you think you weren't going to stay long?".Mirabelle paused and closed her eyes contemplating her answer, "I…honestly did", she said weakly."What would make you think that?", he asked trying to comfort her.She played with her cheesecake with a downtrodden look "Every other host I ever had, either rejected me upon introduction or had me sent away after one night. Some of them…did things to me…tried to hurt me. Tried to…tried…to…", she put her shaking hand over her mouth to muffle her sobs.Caleb tried to stand up to comfort to clearly distressed woman, but she caught his arm and guided him back to his seat. Likely not wanting to draw attention from the other people in the café."There…there are many people that still view us Nightmares as a symbol of misfortune. Humans despise us for our ominous, haunting appearance and other Centaur see us as cowardly, weak, and a disgrace to their species. W-why are we so loathed, we only want to live in peace.", she spoke dolefully."Mirabelle", Caleb interjected, "There will always be folks that treat others like that. Hell there are people who look at me disdainfully.""You…know what's like for people to viewed with contempt?", Mirabelle surprised at that statement.He closed his eyes spoke critically "Well…yeah of course I do, I'm black. Down here in the South my people have a wretched history. We've been persecuted for hundreds of years, we've struggle to have just basic human rights. I mean fuck many of our ancestors started out as slaves."Mirabelle's jaw hung open in complete shock, there was nothing she could say at that moment."But at us now, look at ME now. We're started with little to nothing and we turned it into a better life. Not many people discriminate against us like they did back then. I mean yeah, like I said earlier, I've had to deal with bigots and racists once in a while, but that's just how it is. I guess what I'm trying to say is, it gets easier. The hard part is finding the determination and patience to see it, but it does get easier.", Caleb finished as he went to finishing the last of his broccoli and cheese."C-Caleb, I…", the young centaur uttered still trying to process everything she heard, "I had no idea, I'm so—", Caleb shushed her by clasping her hand on the table. No sympathetic speeches, not today."Acceptance takes time Mirabelle", Caleb continued, "Don't let a few shit heads take away your trust in others".Mirabelle looked at the young man teary eyed. "So…do you accept me Caleb?". He looked her straight into sparkling violet orbs. "Yes, I do." "What do you see when you look at me?", she continued. "I see a girl. A girl who's been hurt, a girl who needs a friend, a girl who deserved to be happy" Suddenly they heard a low grumbling sound that sound like an animal growling. It was Mirabelle's stomach. Caleb, "heh a girl who wants seconds." Mirabelle smiled at the young man, blushing from her slight embarrassment. Caleb called to the waitress "Excuse me, can we have another order of Asian salad?"A couple hours passed with the two finishing up their meal, it was evening and the sun was starting to set. As the botanical garden was closing, Caleb and Mirabelle were waiting on the trolley to bring them back home. They were walking to the closest pick-up stop about three blocks down, blissfully chatting with each other the entire way."and so the guy looks at the waiter and says 'no she didn't, she just walked in the front door", Caleb exclaimed raising both eyebrow while the Centaur walking beside him burst into laughter.Caleb had just finished telling Mirabelle a joke he heard from some coworker awhile back."Hey, look there's the trolley stop point.", Caleb chuckled out, pointing at the sign with the trolley symbol on it.Mirabelle let out the last of her giggles and nuzzled up closer to Caleb as they walked. As they walked out two guys came out of an Applebee's laughing hysterically and clowning around. As the two guys came walking passed Caleb and Mirabelle, one of them said "Whoa, bud. You better get you pony back to its stable before it shits on the road". "Hey partner, you put a saddle on her yet", the other one cackled. Mirabelle held Caleb's arm tighter as she shook with fright. Again the other guy called out, "Yes sir, that would be a sight to see. A monkey riding a horse". Caleb clenched his fist as Mirabelle looked up at him worriedly, he gave her a strained smile and looked up ahead for a moment. The trolley was in sight. One of the men came up close behind "Hey partner how about giving us a little ride on your horse hear?", this made Mirabelle draw back terrified as the man tried to touch her rear. Caleb then grabbed and twisted the man's arm and performed a judo throw knocking him to the ground. Mirabelle looked at the scene in awe. "You fuckin piece of—", said the other man taking a swing at Caleb, who blocked then kneed him in the stomach making the man curl up in pain. As this happened, the first guy took out his knife while Caleb back was turned. Mirabelle saw this and snapped out of her trance. "Nooooo", said rushing at the man and shoving him to the ground. "Gaghhh, stupid ass horse bitch. I gonna cut up that pretty face.", he said as he rushed at her. Mirabelle froze in fear and covered her face. To her surprise, she felt no pain, but opened her when she heard a cry of pain followed by something hitting the ground. She saw that Caleb stood in front of her, while the guy with the knife cradled his eye socket in agony. Eventually to two picked themselves off the ground, the one holding his eye shouted "You fuckin freaks, you don't belong here. And you, you're a deadman. Goddamn n***er". They ran off as the trolley slowly pulled up. Mirabelle winced at their word and looked up at Caleb who was simply shaking his head disappointedly. "It's just like I said you gotta deal with people like that every once in a while." He turned around and looked at Mirabelle who simply stared back."Come on, our ride's here", he stated wistfully and Mirabelle simply nodded and followed him.Soon they arrived back at Caleb's house, they came in the house got settled in from the ride back. Caleb took off his shoes and decided to relax on the couch and Mirabelle took the oversized ottomon to sit next to him."So you enjoyed yourself today Mirabelle?", Caleb asked with a small grin.Mirabelle her head up in surprise "U-uh, I did, I really learned a lot and the gardens were beautiful", she picked up and sniffed her violets. "I will treasure this day for as long as I live"."Heh, well aren't you awfully poetic all of a sudd—Ah.", Caleb winced as he tried to put his hands behind his head. Mirabelle noticed this and eyed Caleb for a minute before noticing a red spot near the should on his shirt."Caleb put your arms down and sit still", he obeyed while she scooted over and lifted up his shirt sleeve. There was a cut on his shoulder that still bled a little. Caleb saw it himself and was surprised. "Whoa when did that happen? Weird, I thought I felt a stinging sensation but I just ignored it. Doesn't look deep though I can just—", Caleb stopped when he saw the now panicking centaur.Maribelle frantically muttering, "Oh gods, uh, we need bandages and water to clean wound. Oh and herbs, and…oh my gods it may need stitches. Don't worry Caleb I'll—", she was cut off by Caleb who grabbed her shoulders."Hey, Hey now it's fine Maribelle. I'll just dab on some rubbing alcohol and put on a bandage. It's all good.", He spoke nonchalantly."It's not Caleb.", she said shaking visibly her vision becoming watery. "It's my fault you were injured. You were protecting me because I couldn't protect myself. I'm such a weakling""Mirabelle, you are not weakling and it's not your fault in the slightest, it was that asshole who was harassing us. Plus, if anything you saved my life. When you pushed that guy, he was about to stab me when I wasn't looking was he?", She nodded slowly. "You saw someone you cared for in danger and you acted, THAT is not being weak, that is courage, you Mirabelle are my hero tonight.", he spoke the last part in a valiant manner.Mirabelle confounded by the emotions that swelled within her stood silent pondering his every word. "You…think I was courageous?", she asked, eyes growing wide in anticipation."of course, you are. And as thanks, tomorrow I'm going to cook you a hero's breakfast then we'll play some Dragonball Fightersz. But I think start with a thank you hug ", He punctuated with his arms outstretched inviting her in. She joyfully rushed into his arms hugging him tightly and enjoying his warmth.The two separated from the hug with Mirabelle blushing and her tail swaying furiously. "Welp it's getting pretty, think we should turn in.", He yawned and started heading for his room. Mirabelle snapped back to reality and made way to her room. "Good night Mirabelle", "Good Night, Caleb", the two in their rooms closing their doors.Caleb looked at his phone. It was already close to 10. He then remembered he had to email some updated notes to his supervisor at work, so he set an alarm on his phone for 4:00 am to email it to him. That way, if his boss was at church, he'd have them in his inbox when he got back. After going through his inbox, Caleb eventually decided to turn in for the night. Soon he started having another dream.Caleb opened his eyes and looked around to see he was in the same grey foggy room as last time. "Ah great, this again", he sighed in contempt. He looked around to try and find anything else he might have missed, soon he spotted the same purple couch. "Okay, this is ridiculous, what the hell is this place? I wonder if the weird lady is still here. Whatever, guess I'll just chill on the couch again.", He groaned as he walked leisurely and laid on the couch. A yawn escaped his lips as he was beginning to close eye, when he slowly opened them again he saw the woman standing behind the couch just starting at him. "Dafuq—ah god", Caleb spouted jerking his head up suddenly and rolling off the couch. "Oh Gods, I'm sorry did I frighten you?", said the worried lady. "You nearly gave me a heart attack, geez what do you want lady?", he asked growing impatient. The woman played with her finger and shuffled her body. Caleb notice her attire was less… risqué. A purple long sleeve turtle neck, a black dress skirt with black stockings, and purple heels. "I…want to apologize for everything I said to you. I know now you didn't deserve that", she apologized in a gentle voice. Caleb sighed in exasperation and pinched the bridge of his nose, "Fine, It's fine, ok? I don't know what that was all about before but I hope whatever your going through it'll all work out. And you did apologize so I'll let it slide.", he said relenting to the flippant woman. The woman then came up to him until they were face to face, smiling and blushing the whole time. "You're so kind. Even in this state, you're still same as you act. So understanding, so patient, and so accepting.", As her blush grew her eyes began to grow more glazed with desire. She put her hand to his chest making Caleb's eyes widen in surprise. "Hey, come on now, what—", She shushed him with her finger as she leaned closer. Suddenly the spot on his chest began to glow, making Caleb mutter in confusion. When the light died down, Caleb pulled his shirt to look at the spot to find…a mark…shaped like a hoof with a crescent moon in the center. "What…what is this?", asked Caleb bewildered. "That is my mark. The mark that unites us as one. You belong to me and I, you. My love.", she spoke in tender tone with a loving smile. Caleb confused just simply accepted her proclamation, mostly not wanting her to fly into another fit of hysteria. "Alright then", he said simply. The woman lit up in excitement and wrapped her arms around his neck. She then leaned in for a kiss, and Caleb puckered his. Suddenly a loud sound like music was playing, the entire room began to rumble like an earthquake, the surroundings began to slowly dissolve into darkness, and the couch turn to dust. "WHAT"S HAPPENING?!", Caleb shouted in fear. "No, Nononono, he's waking up!", the woman exclaimed. "WHAAAAAAAA", Caleb shouted one last time. Everything went black and Caleb, now awake shot up from his bed screaming.He panted looking around and located the source of the noise, His phone's alarm. "Ugh right, that email, shit why'd I choose GorGor for my alarm?! I need gave myself a stroke"., he cursed turning of the alarm. Caleb then remembered the dream he had, "huh, that dream again. Man, what was up with lady? First she hates me now she wants to kiss me?". He sighed and prepared to get out of bed when he heard a whimpering sound.He turned and saw…Mirabelle...standing near the foot of his bed muttering incomprehensible gibberish and looking around frantically."What the? Mirabelle?!", he shot out startling her into falling over on her side.
  
    Chapter Text
    Chapter 3: Moving forwardWriter's notes:What's good Fam? Ok so this took a bit longer than expected. I have had a pretty crazy work load. Plus, finals were coming up and been working on bringing my grade up in thermodynamics. I plan to update at least once every 1-2 weeks but I can't promise too much because well…engineering is a bitch and my boss is relentless. In this chapter I hope to address the incident Caleb had with the two ruffians they encountered. Keep in mind I'm not 100% familiar with how the U.S. justice system works so excuse me if they scenario seems far from the realms of plausibility. Alright lets get into it."Mirabelle, what are you doing in my room?!", Caleb asked turning the lamp on the nightstand, while the confused centaur managed to pick herself up from the floor."Well…um…I…I thought…you see I…uhhh…", Mirabelle stuttered out brushing off her lavender pajamas top and adjust to bottom portion that covered her horse half.Caleb sat up and slid down to the foot of his bed and lightly placed a hand on her shoulder. Mirabelle felt her entire body become stiff as stone. She felt trapped; she had nowhere to run."Mirabelle.", Caleb said as she stared into his eye, "What's wrong? Yer shaking like a caterpillar in a bird's nest."The young centaur remained silent for a few seconds trying to think of an excuse before Caleb asked, "Did you have a nightmare?". Mirabelle blinked comically as he paused and thought about what he had uttered, "I'm sorry poor choice of words". A slight giggle could be heard coming from Mirabelle as he felt her shoulders shake trying to contain her laughter."Uh, Mirabelle, you feelin' alright?", Caleb inquired perplexed by her odd behavior."Caleb, I'm sorry, you just…you just have weird way of putting me at ease. Any way I was just confirming something.", she spoke between giggles."Something like what?", Caleb asked as Mirabelle knelt her entire horse half on Caleb's carpeted floor. "I wanted to really confirm that you are the man you've me.""O…k?, and how exactly did you do that?", he continued as Mirabelle lightly grabbed Caleb's right hand in both of hers and spoke with a gentle tone, "I found out through your dreams.""Beg parden? I think I'm still half asleep. I swear you just said 'You found out through my dreams'", Caleb questioned with an incredulous giggle. "Yes, I did. We Nightmares have to ability to project ourselves into the consciousness of others."Caleb sat dumbfounded at her explanation. He pondered momentarily; searching for the right words on just how to respond to something so random. "You can enter…dreams. What like Freddy Krueger or something?", He asked mentally slapping himself for such an idiotic statement. Mirabelle tilted her head with a confused look. "I…don't know what that is…but, yes I suppose". "Well, ok then. Gotta say you sho'nough explaining it like it's no big deal. Still, I got to say that is really amazing.", Mirabelle blushed at the compliment. "So…wait…the weird dreams I've been havin' lately—", Caleb started but Mirabelle interrupted him, "Y-Yes, they were my doing. I am so very sorry for putting you through that.""Well…not gonna lie that first dream was a bit intense. Caleb responded dryly rubbing his scalp. Mirabelle fiddled with her hands and looked back up at Caleb. "Yes well, when we project our consciousness into a person's dream we normally take the form of what we believe is an ideal consul." She continued. "Someone that person would be comfortable conversing with. It's how we find out a person's true nature or weaknesses we could exploit for protection. However, since our projections are a construct of our emotions…they'll sometimes be prone to fits of aggression which usually results in the person experiencing awful dream. For most, the stress is too great and go into a hysterical fit shortly after awakening."Caleb stared at her absorbing all the info he was just presented. "Geez, that seems like a bit of an overreaction over a little old bad dream. You must have really thought I was bad guy huh?""I'm so sorry, Caleb, it's just at the time I wasn't sure I could trust you at the time. You don't know hard it's been since I joined the exchange program. My last host I did this too…was a truly…truly terrible person" she finished trembling while holder her waist. Caleb's eyes widened at her quivering form and began to rub her shoulder to console her."Mirabelle…I don't know. If you want to tell me I'm right here, and I'm not going anywhere. It's never good to hold your feelings inside like this. They'll only cause you more suffering down the road. Trust me, you don't want to go down that road, it's dark and lonely. Whatever you need, I'm here." Caleb finished in a benevolent tone still rubbing her shoulder tenderly. Mirabelle looked up at his kind dark brown eyes; a wave of comfort and safety washing over her."Caleb. …Ok, I'll tell you.", she said adjusting her lower body on the floor so that her upper body was closer to the bed. Caleb sat in the same spot but crossed his legs on the bed to give her more room. He had her full attention."As I told you, ever since I got into the exchange program, every other host either rejected me upon introduction or had me sent away after one night; Typically, after experiencing my ability.", Caleb nodded thinking of all those hosts reactions to what was likely the craziest night's sleep they ever had. "I started to believe I would never find a person accepting enough to take me in. I was so close to just giving up. That is until I met…him, Jason Chambers.", Mirabelle shifted slightly feeling a shudder creeping up on her. She quickly shook it off and continued. "He seemed like a kind person. However, I thought as soon as I entered his dream and saw his true nature he'd react exactly like the others. He'd become hysterical and run out spouting everything he felt towards me and call Exchange program to have me removed from the house out of fear."Caleb sat wondering how many times has she done this if it's become a routine for her before he shook it off—his attention going back to her. "However, when I entered his dream, instead of immediately succumbing to my consuls charm and exposing himself….well, he reacted in a similar fashion you did, only instead of showing concern and compassion for the consul, he viciously lashed out at her. I was quite surprised and frightened, I was afraid of what he was capable of in his subconcious."" what did he do afterwards?", Caleb asked"The next morning, and a couple times afterwards, he acted as if nothing even happened. I soon stopped going into his dreams because of how violent his mental state was. My mind told me immediately to pack up and leave, but I couldn't.", Mirabelle paused thinking of all the horrifying things he said he'd do to her, "When he was awake, he treated me rather nicely. He would take me to me out shopping, cook for me, and we'd talk for hours about our hobbies. I wasn't sure what to make of him. In his dreams he was a psychopath, awake he was a sweetheart. It confounded my senses to point where I didn't know what to believe. Who was the real Jason?, Mirabelle looked down at the blue sheets on the bed pensively."Overtime though, he began to change. He began working later shifts at his job so he started becoming stressed. Soon he began to ask favors of me. I didn't mind at first because they were little things and I was happy to because of all he had done for me. But soon, he started demanding more from me and whenever I said 'no' he would react violently and guilt trip me with phrases like 'I did this' or 'I did that' for you. We soon started going out less and less, and there were times when he wouldn't give me any food or water as a kind of punishment." She paused again, tears starting to well up."Mirabelle…", Caleb started but when she shook her head and placed a hand on his knee. "Then…", she continued composing herself, "He started asking me personal questions about how centaurs mate. I felt so uncomfortable. When I said I didn't want to answer the question, he soon started…doing things to me.", she tears rolling down her cheeks."Everyday…he would grope… and molest me… and…every day… I could feel myself dying inside a little more…", spoke between sobs.Caleb couldn't believe what he was hearing. "Mirabelle, wasn't your coordinator watching out for you?! Couldn't you tell them what he was doing?", Caleb asked his voice filled with horror."I wanted to, so badly.", she paused wiping her tears. "But, whenever the coordinator would visit, he would have me put on an act that everything was fine. He threatened to kill me if I ever said anything.", she spoke sadly.Caleb clenched his covers trying to control his rage, "How was he caught?!", he managed to spit out."I…It was during one of the visits. At the time, Jason was experiencing a lot more stress from his job. After the coordinator left…he came and found me in my room. He backed me into a corner and grabbed my arm tightly, I was so afraid my body froze in place, I couldn't even speak. *sniff*, H-H-He whispered in my ear that 'He needed to relieve some stress', N-next thing I knew, he was unbuttoning my shirt and…trying to tear off my skirt." She spoke with a lot of discomfort and humiliation in her voice. Caleb could feel his heart drowning in sorrow for the young woman in front of him."I shut my eyes tightly and prayed for him to go away, but then I heard a thump sound. When I opened my eyes, I saw Jason lying on the floor unconscious and my coordinator standing behind him. Apparently, then left their documents in the house and came back to retrieve them", She spoke dryly"Mirabelle, who was your coordinator at that time", He inquired"It was…agent Sterling", she spoke softlyOk, he and I need to have a little chat next time we meet. Caleb thought trying not to appear irate"Afterwards, he was arrested, and I was brought into Interspecies Affairs and underwent rigorous therapy sessions", She spoke coldly as her shoulders slumped, "I…had had enough. But I had nowhere else to go. I didn't want to return to my homeland, back to living in constant ridicule, isolation, and fear. It was Agent Sterling who convinced me to not give up on the program and to try one last time. I reluctantly said yes, I figured I didn't have much else too lose.", she finished with a painfully strained giggle.Caleb got up from his position, grabbing Mirabelle's attention, and knelt down next to her on the floor. He embraced the young woman in a tight hug burying her head in his shoulder."It's ok. He cannot and will not hurt you or anyone else ever again. Mirabelle, I know I can never fully understand the pain you've experienced throughout your life, and I won't tell you something as superficial as 'it's all in the past' or 'in time you'll get over it'. It just doesn't work that way. No one truly gets over anything as terrible as that. Hell, I'm still not over the death of my parents. Add that to the fact that my own brothers and sister hate my guts and to this day want nothing to do with me, I'm surprised I even have the will to get up in the morning." Mirabelle pulled her head up staring into Caleb's eye, her own full of sadness."But, one thing i've learned about pain…", he continued while resting a hand to his chest, "is that it lessens over time. It's still there, but you've learned to acknowledge it, learn from it, and tolerate it. You have to keep moving forward because if you stop, it will only grow until you are swallowed up into despair. It's like my uncle Andrew always says, Everyday it gets a little bit easier, the hard part is doing it everyday", Caleb finished staring into her eyes."But…I…I don't know if I have the strength to anymore", said Mirabelle sadly"What do you mean? The fact that you could bring yourself to tell me something so personal. You've only known me for one weekend. Plus, you gave the whole exchange student thing one more shot, despite what your last host did. That shows you still have some strength left, you're stronger than you believe Mirabelle. So come on, we'll both keep growing together.", Caleb said assuredly as Mirabelle looked at him with hopeful gaze."Caleb…I'm still very weak. I'll just end up leaning on you.", She said looking down at the floor."What's wrong with that?", Caleb said causing her head to perk up in surprise, "I'm still pretty weak. I'm also quick to anger, a little perverted, a weirdo, and kinda dumb sometimes. As we move forward, lets lean on each other. If engineering has taught me anything, the best supports comes from two stable structures. I'm right here Mirabelle, whatever pain you have, you won't bare it alone." After saying this Mirabelle broke down into a crying mess as her emotions came rushing in like a tsunami. Caleb held her in tight hug which she returned with her own even tighter hug sobbing into his chest leaving Caleb's pajama shirt drenched in tears. Caleb just held her tight the entire time, lightly massaging her scalp."Y-You're so kind.", She uttered starting to regain her composure. "You're the first host I've met, who's treated me with such earnest compassion. Why? Why couldn't I have met you sooner?!", She said penitently.Caleb used his finger to tilt her head up at his face, "Well…you know what they say. Better late, then never.", he said with a playful giggle.Mirabelle gave him the biggest smile she could mustered. "I'm so glad I met you. I knew I made the right choice giving you this", she spoke pulling down on Caleb's shirt revealing the hoof mark with a crescent moon in the center on the left side of his chest.Caleb raised an eyebrow at the strange hoof mark on his chest. "What in the world is this? It kinda looks like a birthmark.", he spoke examining his chest with his hand."It's my mark. In my culture, if we find a person we care for deeply, we enter their dream and place a mark on them that bonds us forever. We each have our own individual mark and It is a symbol of our trust, loyalty, and…fondness towards that individual. It connects me to you; even if we are thousands of miles apart, I will always find you through your dreams.", she explained with a light-hearted voice."So, it's something of best friends forever ring, that's pretty cool.", he responded casually.Mirabelle gave a befuddled expression before refuting " U-uh…yes? But it has even greater meaning than that.", She finished shyly covering her smile.Caleb giggled at her expression. "Yeah, but if it means you recognize me as your friend, I'm cool with it."Mirabelle giggled examining Caleb's expression "Hehe, you know, I must say…you are taking this surprisingly well.""Well, I've always been receptive to new things. Even if I don't fully understand them. It's one of my more unusual flaws.", He joked with a shrug."I don't think it's a flaw, it's a gift.", She said with bright glowing eyes with admiration.Caleb let out a low chuckle before looking at the time on his phone—4:30a.m. it read. "Wow, it's pretty late. We should get some rest if I'm going to make you your hero's breakfast on time."Mirabelle looked away fidgeting to herself before Caleb said, "Hey, you alright there". "I'm fine, it's just..." she paused before a blush came on her cheeks. Caleb thought for a minute then it hit him, of course she doesn't want to be alone right now, "Mirabelle, do you want to sleep with me tonight?", he asked causing her jump slightly covering her mouth before nodding quickly. "B-but I mean like next to me, within the same vicinity, not like, uh you know", Caleb mumbled as Mirabelle giggle at his nervousness. "But wait, I don't think the bed will support you very well.", Caleb said. "It's no trouble. Just like regular horses, we centaur can sleep standing up and sitting down.", Mirabelle explained. "Well, the least I can do is make it more comfortable for you", Caleb stated before taking the blankets off his bed and lying them on the floor along with two big pillows for each side of her body. "Thank you, Caleb", she replied with an elated grin. She loved how considerate towards her he was. It gave her an indescribable amount of comfort. "*yawn* Good night, Mirabelle.", Caleb said climbing into bed and drifting off to sleep. "Good night, Caleb. My dear.", she spoke the last part softly to herself before falling asleep next to her human.A damn I have to send those notes to Rodney. …Ah fuck it, it's a revival at his church so he's gonna be there til 8 tonight. I got plenty of time., he thought before drifting off again.***************4 hours later****************It was a quiet peaceful Sunday morning in Huntsville. Everyone was either taking some much-needed rest from work or heading off to worship at the alter for a sure to be enthusiastic sermon. As Caleb was waking from his slumber. He looked off to his right to the pile of blankets on his floor but no sleeping centaur. He figured she went to her room to change out of her pajamas. Pulling himself out of bed, followed by a few long stretches, he picked up the blankets and pillows and stuffed them in the closet. He suddenly remembered everything that was brought upon him in the middle of the night.Well…that sure was a revelation. After an experience like that I can't blame her for being suspicious of me. Tch, hope that piece of shit got what more than deserved. He thought rubbing the sleepy from his eyes. He then went to a mirror and examined the hoof mark on the side of his chest. I think she said this gets darker the more we grow closer. Looks kinda cool though, I can pass this off as tattoo I always said I'd get but never did, he thought putting on a purple t-shirt with a ghost Pokemon that looked like a ragdoll on it and grey sweatpants to wear. As he left his room he noticed the scent of smoke wafting throughout his home. He followed the scent to the kitchen; which he found was permeated with a cloud of smoke and the sounds of panicked shrieks. Kicking his survival senses in high gear, he ran toward the smoke and saw that it was Mirabelle frantically trying to put out a burning flame."AIIIIIYYEEEE!", she shrieked again as the skillet started to catch fire. Caleb shouted in panic rushing towards her, turning off the stovetop, putting out the flaming skillet with the extinguisher in the lower cabinet. As the sound of the crackling metal and popping of the charred remains of food began to die down, Caleb let out a sigh of relief and turned to see Mirabelle still shaking and fidgeting with her apron…or really one of Caleb's aprons."ahem…so, wanna tell me what the early morning fire drill was all about?", he said sarcastically showing off the burned-up matter in the pan."I-I was trying to surprise you by making you breakfast. I wasn't sure what you like so I just chose randomly. I made you…an omelet.", she replied embarrassedly looking over at the mess of egg shells at the edge of the counter. Sweet mother of Christ, she cooked the eggs THIS badly and the whole thing is drowning in melted butter., Caleb thought staring at the culinary catastrophe in his hand."I…am an herbivore so I don't have the right taste pallet for meats but I still wanted to try anyway", she said snapping Caleb out of his thoughts.Caleb scratched the back of his head looking at her then back at the black clump before walking up to her petting her head. "That's fine. You don't have to cook meat. I'll eat whatever you make. I really need to eat more veggies anyway", he said with toothy grin as Mirabelle gazed up at his face."Besides I promised you a hero's breakfast. So, let me get started on that. How do you feel about some French toast, a big fruit salad, carrot pancakes, and some scrumptious mango juice smoothie?", he said graciously with a wink. Mirabelle slightly drooled at the thought "Oh yes, yes, yes, that would be fantastic.""Indeed that would be fantastic, set me up a place too would ya", said an unknown voice. "Hubba wha?!", Caleb and Mirabelle both exclaimed as they comically looked in the direction of their surprise visitor. It was Agent Sterling leaning over the counter with a content smirk sipping a cup of coffee. "Good morning to you too Mr. Beezle and Ms. Marequine.""Urgh, It's Bizzell.", Caleb growled clenching his teeth before continuing, "what are you doing here Agent Sterling? How'd you even get in my house the front door was locked?", Caleb questioned scanning the man's weirdly composed posture."Well, A: This is one of my checkup days where I see how program participants are doing. And B: I have government clearance to enter your home with or without your consent. All apart of making sure nothing…suspicious is going on.", he explained slightly tilting down his sunglasses eyeing Caleb."You know people can abuse authority like that. I really don't want to think you may be up to anything sketchy Agent Sterling", Caleb replied raising an eyebrow."Hmm true, it's possible. However, as it stands I am very professional in my work and wouldn't dream of doing anything that is not standard protocol. Really, as a host, you are the one who is under constant observation for anything 'sketchy' so I do hope you keep your snarky comments to yourself.", he finished with a slightly menacing tone."Y-Yes sir.", Caleb uttered feeling a wave of fear go through his spine."Now how's about that breakfast, I haven't eaten at all yet and I got five my families to visit.", he asked with a sigh sipping his coffee. "Alright, i'll get started now. Mirabelle, be a dear and set the table for me", Caleb said relenting to the situation."Oh, of course, Caleb", She replied happily walking off to the kitchen grabbing plates and silverware before heading off into the dining room.Caleb walked into the kitchen grabbing the box pancake mix dumping it in a bowl and cracking eggs in another bowl for the French toast. "So, I see you guys are on a first name basis now.", inquired the Agent sitting at the counter with a smirk., "Seems to me you're are getting along well?""Yeah, I'd say we're getting along swimmingly. Heck I'd say we've become fast friends", Caleb answered dumping the chopped carrots in the batter. He then mixed the eggs, vanilla, sugar, and cinnamon for the bread."mmmhm yes, I can see she's really taken a liking to you. Seeing as how she's nearly going to burn the house down trying to make you breakfast.", He replied with a chuckle taking adding some bourbon into his coffee. Caleb sweat-dropped at the thought of his house being engulfed in flames and Mirabelle shouting, "I just wanted to make you pancakes!"."Now what exactly is 'Heroes Breakfast'? Is it like some special occasion?", Sterling asked taking a sip of his drink. Caleb, placing the pieces of toast on a serving tray turned around to reply. "In a way, yes. Think of it like…celebrating a heroic deed. FYI, I made it up myself.", He finished with a haughty smirk."Obviously, and what would that deed be exactly?", He said glancing up from his cup."Well…you know like—", Caleb started but was then cut off, "Like defending another person from a couple of uppity bigots?", Sterling stated shooting a look that said 'I know everything' at Caleb causing a chill to run up his spine."W-what? how do you know about that—", Caleb was cut off again, "Well, if I'm being honest we were keeping tabs on you two from you little garden outing yesterday. We just want to be sure the student in our programs is receiving a proper introduction into our culture and our host is abiding by all the guidelines. ALL the guidelines. But what I want to know is why you didn't report the incident to me sooner?!"Caleb, finishing Mirabelle's the fruit salad and began to start on the pancakes. "I…I guess I wasn't thinking clearly at the time. Both Mirabelle and I were just wanted to get home and forget that whole mess ever happened. But wait, why didn't you have your guys step in during that whole altercation?!"Agent Sterling adjusted his glasses "I wanted to see for myself what your intentions were. Our program participants are faced with all aspects of human culture, this includes the uglier aspects. It is the host's duty to prepare their house guests for whatever civil challenges they'll face. So, for some hosts we keep a very close eye on them for the first few days after joining the program to confirm they're obeying their Civic duty", he said swirling to coffee with a straw pensively."So, you were seeing if I could protect Mirabelle in situations like that? That's a little irresponsible, what if Mirabelle had gotten seriously hurt?!", Caleb asked incredulously making sure not to burn the pancakes."There was no need to worry, there were 4 MON agents nearby in case the situation looked dire. However, it looks like the host managed to handle everything fine, and came out unscathed.", He replied casually."Well yeah, relatively at least.". Caleb said showing the half-scabbed wound he received from the knife.Agent Sterling examined the cut for a minute "Ah that's…unfortunate. Mr. Bizzell on behalf of my associates, we apologize for neglecting your safety as well.", He said apologetically."Eh, it's cool, I guess. It's not even that bad of a cut. So what about those dip shits that attacked us?"Well seeing how this an aggravated assault by them on a Host and his homestay—and given that it constitutes racially motivated assault—they will likely receive 5 years in prison with supervised community service. You, on the other hand, since your actions were in the service of protecting your and your homestay, you'll likely get off on self-defense. However, in the future any incidents involving your homestays MUST be reported the exchange program or to MON immediately to be dealt with appropriately. Incidents like these can reflect poorly on the Exchange program and the last thing we need is any more controversy. This is your ONLY freebie don't take it lightly Mr. Bezzell.", he finished taking a bite of the French toast."I will sir, thank you, it's Bizzell by the way.", He replied with a nod showing clear understanding.Agent Sterling cracked a smile at the young man and nodded back. Caleb finished making the last of the pancakes. He then quickly blended a mango smoothie and took a tray of food to the dining room where Mirabelle was happily waiting at the table reading a book. By the looks of it, it was from the Harry Potter series. "Hey, Hey, Hey, here comes food for yo tum-may", Caleb exclaimed comically as Mirabelle let out a hearty chuckle. She took her place as Caleb placed her bowl of fruit salad and pancakes in front of her and placed two pieces of toast on her plate. "~ooooh, Caleb this is so good~. The berries in the salad are so fresh and these. Mmmm so warm and carrots are so rich mmhm.", she cooed as she contently ate her food. "Hehehe, glad you like it. I put in a little extra love seeing as how this IS your hero breakfast", He said handing her a glass of mango smoothie. Mirabelle blushed and shot him a glowing smile, "There goes that charm again, but you're also my hero too you know". Caleb simply shrug eating his sausage "Afterwards, let's play some Dragonball Fighterz, I'll show you the ropes then proceed to beat you into them.", he said with a challenging grin. Mirabelle finished up her salad and shot him the same look, "Ha, we shall see about that." "You look like an Android 18 kind of girl. So I'll start you off with her. Don't worry, I'll be fair and pick someone I'm only a little good with" he said pointing his fork. Mirabelle rolled her eyes taking a bite of her toast, "Gee, what a noble guy"."Pffhahahahaha, man you guys rich. I swear it won't be long before you're wearing matching cloths", Agent Sterling spat out getting the attention of the two in the other room. He then scanned their attire noticing Mirabelle's light purple shirt and light grey cloak over horse half and Caleb purple t-shirt and grey sweatpants, "Oh my god, it's already happening, Hahahahahaha.". Caleb and Mirabelle examined each other up and down then looked away in embarrassment."Ah, whatever. I happen to think we look good together. Right, Mirabelle?", He replied finishing the last of his toast. "R-right.", Mirabelle giggled looking up at him lovingly.After finishing up breakfast, Caleb took up all their dishes and placed them all in the dishwasher. Mirabelle went off into the bathroom to take a quick bath. After wiping down whatever mess was left on the counter, Caleb noticed Agent Sterling examining the files in his leather briefcase before getting up and walking to Caleb's direction."So , are you enjoying your job as a host so far?", he said closing the briefcase putting away a small manila folder."Well, yeah, got to say Mirabelle's really nice, sweet, patient—", he was suddenly cut off."Beautiful?", Sterling said with smirk"Gorgeous in fa—Whoa ohohoho holllld up.", he stopped himself before finishing that sentence."hahahahaha kid, you are too easy. But uh, remember, no 'funny business'", he finished with a furrowing his eyebrows. "Got to say though, I don't think I've ever seen that girl so happy to be living with any host.", He stated looking off at where Mirabelle once was.Suddenly a thought came to Caleb, "hey Agent Sterling, I have a question I wanted to ask you?""Hm, oh ok, shoot", he said nonchalantly looking at the young man with attentive eyes."It's about Mirabelle's host before me, Jason Chambers.", Caleb asked clenching his fist tightly against washcloth."How do you know that name?", Sterling asked quizzically eyeing Caleb behind his shades."I didn't do anything illegal in case your wondering, I found out from Mirabelle. She told me... everything. And I mean everything. And I know how confidential information like that is and I promise have no intention using it for malicious gains. I have too much respect for her.", Caleb finished in somber tone.Sterling continued to observe the young trying to find any trace of dishonesty, he found none. "Very well, now your question?" , He adked finally."I wanted to know how you guys didn't notice something was wrong? During all those visits you realize Mirabelle was being abused and mistreated? How?!" , He questioned trying his best to restrain himself.Sterling let out an annoyed sigh before standing from the kitchen counter seat, "Mr. Bizzell, do know how many liminal students sign up for the exchange program daily? Over 350 on a biweekly basis, and more than a third of them are liminals that were taken out of situations similar to Mirabelle's. Many of their past hosts passed their screenings but later proved to be the most disgusting I've ever laid my eyes on. This program is still relatively new mistakes can be made. In the passed 6 years, there have been dozens of incarnations for the abuse of liminal by hosts, in many cases the abused liminals don't or won't testify for fear of deportation or the host themselves.", He finished getting up and walking into the living room.Caleb was about to say something before Sterling stopped him, " You have any idea how much I regret not checking into Mirabelle's situation thoroughly? If I was a bit more observant she wouldn't have had to suffer like that. I honestly didn't want to have her go to another host but I saw that look in her eyes at the mention of going back to her homeland. It was the most heart wrenching thing I ever seen", he finished with a strained look on his face"So what happened to that son of a bitch?", Caleb asked in a serious tone."He's currently serving a life sentence, he'll never see the light of day again", Sterling finished with a noticeable amount of venom."Good", Caleb stated plainly as Sterling nodded."There's one last thing I want to ask you Agent Sterling. It's about Mirabelle's species.", Caleb asked simply while his thoughts went back to the events from last night. Sterling raised an eyebrow at him taking a seat on the couch. "I kinda found out first-hand about a Nightmare's ability to enter dreams.""Hehehe, did you now?, Sterling stated with grim, "That's a first, usually they end up hollering like they seen the holy ghost or something." Sterling finished with a hearty chuckle. "So how'd you do it, kid?". Caleb stared for a second in disbelief before saying, "She told me herself"."Wait really, damn she must really like you more than I thought." , Sterling said"Yeah, but what I want to know is why there was nothing about it in her information packet about her species. I even looked up info about it online and came up with nothing." Sterling leaning back in contemplation before giving his answer. "Well, it's quite simple we just didn't include it.", he said plainly.Caleb confounded by his answer continued, "Why? Wouldn't that be vital information to know?"Sterling adjusted his position on the couch, "Remember when I told you that her centaur species are very timid? Well, to be frank, most of them are pacifists. The moment they feel threatened they either run away or freeze instantly, they rarely ever fight back at their attackers. According to the Exchange Bill of America, every liminal has the right to defend themselves from attackers using whatever means to subdue them until proper authorities may deal with them. We need to allow all liminals the same right to self-defense with any means they can. However, there have been criminal organizations and even some hosts to take advantage of liminal by using their abilities for personal gain or commit vicious crimes. It's much worse if the liminal produces high quality material, like milk from Minotaur and lamias shedded skin or has special powers like a Yuki onna's cryo-kinesis and mimics shape shifting. Imagine what someone could do with a liminal that can enter dreams-learning everything about a target from bank account numbers to blackmail material.", he finished with contemplative tone.Caleb nodded for a minute thinking about the new information relayed to him before Sterling continued. "So, to answer your question, we omitted the information of that ability to avoid any public discord. Imagine the scumbags that would want to get their hands on a being like that. Not to mention the rumors that would spread here in the states. Those rumors would turn to fear, fear will turn to hate, which will then lead to people acting on hate. Other centaur species would be targeted as well just because of mistaken identity.", he said looking intently at Caleb.Caleb nodded beginning to comprehend their reasoning behind their actions. "Well, you're not wrong about us humans overreacting, but wouldn't there be people that are also hosting a Nightmare to figure about this ability eventually?"Agent Sterling looked at his phone at the time and rose from the couch, "I don't think that's a problem. Mirabelle's the only Nightmare in the Exchange program here in the States.""Wait, seriously?!", Caleb spouted incredulously"Well yeah, few the no Nightmares actually signed up to take part in the program here. Apparently, much of the species has been in hiding for decades and they're very difficult to find. You have no idea how difficult it is to even interview ONE. What information that's available was provided for us by the European branch under a confidentiality agreement. There's still much we don't know about them. Annnnd that's where you come in.", He finished with a haughty smirk."What, Me? Why me?", Caleb asked with a surprised look."As a host of one of the most elusive species to date, it is your job to learn as much as you can about her, so the exchange program can understand them better. Can I count on you Mr. Bizzill","It's Bizzell, dammit, and yeah of course, it's my duty as a host after all. Actually,I think there's some info you guys could use.", Caleb finished as he adjusted his shirt to show the hoof print on his chest."What in the world is that? You have a tattoo of a hoof?", he said curiously looking at the mark."Actually no, Mirabelle placed it on me in a dream last night. She says it's a thing in her culture to place these on people they truly care for. Also, it apparently grows darker in color as we grow closer", Caleb explained."Whoa, that's incredible. Hang on, I need to make a note of all this.", He said taking out a silver colored Tablet from the side pocket of his briefcase, "is there anything else you learned about her ?"Caleb explained everything he had learned from Mirabelle the night before. "That's about all I learned so far""haha alright, I tell ya you're already proving to be a valued participant in the Exchange program. Keep it up, and I may consider doing something nice for ya.", Caleb rolled his eyes at the grinning man in the suit."Yeah, can't wait", Caleb said sarcastically giving a thumbs-up. As Sterling was finishing typing down the notes he looked at the clock to see it was almost 9:30, "Well kid, thanks for breakfast among other things, I need. to finish my rounds for the day. I'll be back again to check up on you guys. Goodbye, ", he said." That one was on purpose", Caleb replied irritated."Probably" he exclaimed as he left out of the front door, leaving it partially open."Sigh, alright (could at least close the damn door behind yourself)", Caleb said under his breath before closing it.Caleb, feeling exasperated from all the information swirling in his head, went into the kitchen to the refrigerator for the only thing that would put his mind at ease. . He pulled out a can from the door rack and popped the cap. "Oh take me away you can of liquid bliss", He said enjoying the sweet, heavenly carbonated nectar of Heaven. As it burned the back of his throat he could feel his mind settling down. He composed himself leaning his back against the refrigerator and began to think. This is really getting more complicated by the minute. Sigh, I really want to be a good host for Mirabelle, but I wonder if I'm really up for the challenge. She needs some stability in her life, we both do, I don't know if can really give her that. I only became a host for own benefit. I've just been so depressed lately. Uncle Andrew talking about moving back to Cleveland to help his daughter, I hardly see my best friends anymore—Jamie's getting transferred to another site and Blake's been busy with his new family after getting married—they are all moving forward with their lives but I'm just here in a big empty house…alone. I needed something to distract me from that feeling instead of dealing with it. Goddamit, I'm such a selfish coward., He thought sinking down the fridge while looking up at the ceiling."C-Caleb?", a voice said shaking the young man out of his thoughts. He stood straight up and saw Mirabelle holding a towel around her neck looking at him with a concerned expression. "Are you…Alright?""Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm good.", he said forcing out a smile, "Did you enjoy your bath?""Yes, I did, I left you plenty of hot water if you need one too", she said sweetly."Thanks, I'll take a shower a little later first I'm going school you in how to be awesome at video games", he said with a pompous tone."Oh…are you certain about that dear?", she said attempting to copy his tone."Indeed, here I'll get us set up", He said moving quickly to the living room, turning on the flat screen and PS4. He tapped on the Dragonball FighterZ logo and it placed the controller on the pillow. He adjusted the couch so that Mirabelle could sit down next to him and handed her a controller."Alright, get ready hun. You're about to see a master at work", Caleb proclaimed as Mirabelle rolled her eyes.****************************2 hours later***********************************"What. The. Hell. Is. Happening?!", Caleb announced gritting his teeth and hold his controller intensely.Mirabelle simply giggled at how cute he looked when he was frustrated. "Are…you ok over there dear?""How are you so good at this Mirabelle? I showed you all the controls once, how are you dominating me 11 matches to nothing?!", he asked befuddled."Well…remember the dream you had last night?", she began.Caleb paused the game and asked curiously, "Yeah, why?""Well…when I was looking into your personality more I may have taken a look at your knowledge on the game.", she said placing a finger to her mouth and tilting her heard to look adorable. It worked."Then…why did you let me explain the controls of the game and how to use the controller then?", he asked raising an eyebrow.Mirabelle blushed thinking about when he was standing close to her holding her hands showing her the controls. She thought of his strong but kind hands to hers and how close their faces were. She blushed even harder and looked down, steam rising from her head. "I-I-I wanted to be extra certain.""um…ok?", Caleb said tilting his head slightly.Ok, this was good. A lot of information to digest at once so here's your complimentary plot fiber tablet to help thing break down. *Hands you plot fiber tablet and some water*. Well in the next chapter I wanted to introduce a new character. Thing is, I'm not sure whether to make her an Arachne, a devil, or a werewolf. I'll let you guys vote on which you'd like to see, just PM me before the 8th of May and I'll decide to write the winner. Also, hope the explanation for the dream sequences at least made some semblance of sense but at the end of the day it's my story so….Alright, I'll see you guys next time. Later Fam.

    Chapter 4: A Howlin' Good TimeWriter's NotesWhat's good Fam? Ok, you've all voted and here it is. Our new homestay will be *Dramatic Pause* …a… *Dramatic Pause again* WEREWOLF. AHWOOOOOO, that was a close match. Thank you all for voting. Alright this chapter may involve a couple of lemonish bits. But hey, if life gives you lemons you make sure to have plenty of tissue nearby to clean up the spilled `juices. I'm making this chapter a bit more comical and light-hearted, stepping out of the grittiness for a little harmless fun. As usual, I own none of the rights to Monster Musume, please support the official release, and please don't sue my ass. I live in a cave bro *tear*. Now that I'm done dallying your dillies, let's get started.Two and a half weeks had passed since Mirabelle first arrived to live with Caleb for the durations of the Exchange program. There had been some noticeable changes in the once quiet and humdrum household. For one, Caleb's work schedule became a bit more flexible. After informing his supervisors about his participation in the Exchange program, they agreed to allow him to come into the office two days a week but work primarily on new project designs from home. The beauty of it is he was paid roughly the same but frequently needed to update on his progress through video chats and the occasional in-home visit from his supervisor.The extra free time he had meant he could help Mirabelle adjust more to living in human society. It was little things like frequenting public grocery stores to get her used to shopping amongst other people or explaining and demonstrating the use of public amenities like the post office. Caleb would explain certain aspects and social constraints pertaining to each place they visited. The two even came across a new shop—Kami House—that had opened in town. It was an anime store with plenty of merchandise to make any hardcore enthusiast drool from happiness. The two made it one of their frequent hangouts almost immediately. It was quite difficult getting Mirabelle to leave once she started reading Sailor Moon manga; Caleb, of course, buy would them for her just to coax her into moving. Every now and again, they would still encounter the occasional disapproving whispers and stares from strangers. A few times they came across an establishment that refused them service because of her species. Caleb made sure to report these places to Sterling. In these instances, Mirabelle would stay huddled closely Caleb—almost trying to hide in his shadow—to this Caleb would always pull her aside and whisper to her 'We'll face it together'. It always seemed to still her mind and calm her a bit.During one of their excursions, they visited a local farmer's market. Mirabelle was quite jubilant to see the many assortments of fruit and vegetables, even excitedly pointing out gardening facts about each produce. Caleb remembered she told him one of her hobbies was gardening and has read dozens of books on plants. After leaving, Caleb came up with the idea to ask his landlord if Mirabelle could make her own garden in the backyard. He agreed, as long it was kept small. Mirabelle was so happy she rose up on her hindlegs in the house squealing joyfully. Subsequently, destroying the coffee table in the living room on her way down. She didn't stop apologizing for the two days.Indeed, their days were filled with many trials but also an abundance of happiness.Today was a blissful, Wednesday morning and Caleb was lying in his bed slowly waking up as the morning sunrays shined through the lite blue curtains with tiny assorted water pokemon lining the hem. The alarm on his phone played AC/DC's 'Shoot to Thrill' at a startling high volume making the young man mentally curse the device for interrupting his slumber. He turned over to silence the small, noisy fiend on the nightstand, when he felt something…squishy and warm in his palm and fingers. He gave a light curious squeeze and a short squeak followed by a low moan came with it.Why am I getting a weird sense of Déjà vu?, he thought before his eyes suddenly shot open and they were met with Mirabelle's flustered face and glazed over eyes. He looked down to see that his left hand was lightly holding her right breast through the open section of her striped lavender button-down pajama shirt."Gah, Mirabelle?", Caleb exclaimed ripping his hand away and adjusting his position so that he was sitting with his back against the wall near the curtains."Ah! Uh, good morning Caleb.", the startled and flustered centaur replied trying her hardest not to fumble her words.Caleb let out a weary sigh rubbing his eyes lazily. He then noticed the collection of blankets and pillows on the side of his bed. "Mirabelle, we've been over this. If you want to sleep together please ask me first. I wouldn't mind the company.", he said as she started to compose herself."I'm sorry Caleb. I just got little cold... and a bit lonely and I thought you felt the same so...", she trailed off feeling unsure of herself.Ok the lonely thing I get, but cold? Come on girl, it was 80 degrees last night, he thought incredulously. He then looked at her adorable sheepish expression and decided to let it" Look it's no big deal. I appreciate the concern. Plus, you're like the perfect cuddle buddy. I haven't slept this well in the last few years.", he said giving her a sweet smile as he stretched his body. He moved towards the edge and stood in front of where she stood."Thank you", She replied tilting her head endearingly, "I'm just happy to see my dear isn't bothered by any troublesome nightmares. No pun intended."He lightly scratched her horse-like ears warranting a blissful mewl from Mirabelle as she rested head to his hand. "The only nightmares I'm happy to have is this one right here. Pun definitely intended", he said gently furrowing his eyebrows causing her to blush heavily staring into his eyes lovingly. She leaned into laying her head to his chest. He massaged the small of her back as her breasts pushed into his lap. The smooth sensation made his legs feel like jelly. That is until he felt a familiar hardness in his groin area growing slowly. uh-oh, he thought. He then lightly moved her off his lap and moved with his legs crossed to her side hoping she didn't notice. She gave him confused and... slightly disappointed look."I…presume you slept well. Did you have any good dreams?", She said cheerfully perking her ears up."I think you already know the answer to that.", He said with an imperious smirk."Hehe right.", she said with a slight giggleCaleb then extended his arm toward her with his pinky outstretched expectantly; getting her attention, Mirabelle did the same interlocking their pinkies."Lali-Ho!", They chanted in unison while pumping their interlocked fingers then shooting their hands up to the ceiling at the end.They shared a hearty laugh before they heard the familiar rumbling sound of a starving centaur. "Alright Moon pie, I'm going to take a quick shower then I'll start on breakfast. How's that sound?", he picked up his phone and looked at the time and day. 7:45 a.m. on a Wednesday. Apricot Waffles Day."That sounds wonderful dear, I'll put up my bed.", she said picking up a large pillow."You know, I may as well get you a mattress in here. ", he said grabbing a green collared shirt that had a strange symbol on it and black jeans."I'll take you up on that offer", she replied with a smirk.*PAUSE*Now as the reader, you are probably asking yourself a few questions. Well to do that we'll have to go back a couple weeks.Comedic rewinding to the pastIt was at that Sunday night after Sterling's visit. Caleb was beginning to turn in for the night after finishing the dishes to a lovely dinner with his homestay. After turning off the television and gaming system, he shortly ruminated over the many losses he had to the surprisingly skilled centaur. He straightened up the couch, adjusting the pillows and cushions in the appropriate order and began to make his way to his room. He opened the door but was not prepared for what he saw.Mirabelle was kneeling on the floor facing the door to his room. She was wearing her purple buttoned up pajamas same beige cape from earlier. He turned on the light and immediately felt an odd tension in the atmosphere. She looked up at him momentarily before nervously looking down to her front legs."Mirabelle, ya do know your room is on the other side of the hallway, right?", he said nonchalantly attempting to break the tension."Y-yes, of course.", she said softly avoiding eye contact. She then rose up and began to walk out of the room as Caleb maneuvered past her."Okay, goodnig-", he started to say before Mirabelle stopped suddenly half-way out the door. She was fidgeting as if she was trying to contain something. "hey, you alright?", he asked growing concerned."Caleb", She started, "I heard you and Sterling talking earlier."She thought back to when she hid around the corner of the hallway after leaving the bathroom. She stood there listening to the two men talk.Caleb froze thinking of possible reason why she's upset. Suddenly it hit him, she was upset about him casually talking about her traumatic experience with the coordinator behind her back AND telling him, likely, personal information about her people without permission. Ah you stupid insensitive piece of shit, He thought mentally berating himself for not respecting her privacy."O-oh, yeah. Look Mirabelle, I'm so sorry, I should have asked you first if it was okay to—?", he said remorsefully before she stopped him."Caleb, did you mean it?! When you said I was beautiful?", she asked turning around quivering slightly and hugging her chest with a light blush on her face still avoiding his gaze.…Wait, What!? That's what she's thinking about? Caleb thought shaking himself out of his critical attitude. He decided to drop it and simply answer her question. That'll come later."I…well yeah of course I did. And for the record, I was going to say you're gorgeous.", he said plainly causing her to look up in shock with somewhat hopeful eyes. She gave an inquisitive expression and was to about say something before Caleb interrupted."And before you even say it, No, it's not just your human-half I find attractive. I love the horse part of you as well.", Caleb said as he walked over to her side then place his hand on her shoulder. Mirabelle looked at him then glanced down to her lower half."How can you be attracted something so…unsightly?", she asked finding the nerve to look him in the eyes."What do you mean? It a part of who you are. If anything, it only adds to your beauty not detract from it. Anyone who says it's 'unsightly' has clearly been staring at the sun too damn long.", he finished with an accepting smile. He knelt down to her legs and looked up with an out raised. She hesitated for second but gave him an approving nod. He light brushed the smooth, velvet-like fur on her thick but surprisingly light leg inciting a startled squeak from her. " Your perfect, just how you are."Mirabelle remained silent for a second; her eyes glistening full of joy as she blushed strawberry pink. Finally, she smiled at Caleb looking up at him longingly. " Caleb", she muttered."Yeah?", he said rising to his feet to meet her face to face." I...have something to give you", she said meekly fidgeting slightly."Is it another mark? cuz I don't need any more besides this one.", he said pulling his shirt down exposing the crescent moon hoofprint, " Hey, is it me? Or has this thing gotten darker".Mirabelle examined it for a second. It was a little darker. Her eyes sparkled in admiration and she felt a sudden jolt of resolve."Y-yes it has. And it's not another mark. Now, please close your eyes.", she spoke almost candidly which surprised him. He mentally shrugged and did as she asked. She stepped up closer and leaned down a bit.This...is all my courage., she thought as she firmly pressed her lips to Caleb's cheek.Caleb's shot wide open. She stood looking at him longingly as pressed both her hands in between her cleavage and exhaled slowly.Caleb blinked rapidly processing what happened until he came out with, " uh...heh well someone's pretty audacious all of a sudden. Guess I have two marks treasure now", he said rubbing the cheek she kissed. She stood silently with a smile, tears forming in the corners of her eye. He got closer and cupped her face which she leaned into. He then saw her lips part and her eyes become glazed over with desire. Deciding to keep things from escalating any further, he gently pulled away much to her surprise."Haha, well it's uh getting late we should get some rest. I have work tomorrow so I'll ask Sterling to send someone to watch you", he said nervously rubbing his shoulder."O-Ok she said softly then turning around, taking extra precaution not to knock over or break anything, "Good night Caleb dear, sweet dreams.", she said quickly rushing out as she closed the door.'Sigh, not even two days and I already violated the exchange law. That's gotta be a record somewhere. Also, 'Dear,?', he thought before a horrifying realization made itself known."Ahhh shit, I forgot I need to email those damn designs to Rodney.", He exclaimed to himself rushing over to his laptop knocking over two mini Star Wars ship models, "Oh please God, let him have gone overboard with the reception wine."Later that night as Caleb was fast asleep he began to have another dream. Duh.Caleb was standing in the same grey, foggy room. He was in his pajamas that consisted of a brown t-shirt and grey pajamas bottoms."Seriously, again?", he said an annoyed grimace, "HEY, Mirabelle. I know you can hear me."As soon he said that a glowing crack appeared in front of him. It outstretched itself to form a circular and stepping through it was the same woman from before. She looked at Caleb with cheerful yet bashful expression."Hello Caleb dear. There's no need to shout I was close beside you the whole time.", she said lightly rubbing her ears with her fingers."Oh, sorry didn't mean to holler at ya—wait, HOLD up. Mirabelle why did you bring me back here?", he asked.She looked away pensively for a second before muttering, "I…I just really like having you here. You bring this delightful atmosphere to this place, something no one has ever done. Your dreamscape is so serene."Caleb felt a bit warmed by her word but shifted himself to stay focused. "Ok, I don't really get what half of that means, but…thanks?""What I mean to say is…you're the first person who's never rejected me in this world.", she said with a pleasant grin.Caleb saw how content she was and decided to simply let his slight grievance pass. "Well…I guess I'm fine with it then. So, if this is my dream scape' as you put it why is it so empty in here except for that couch?", he inquired pointing at the couch from last time., ""We only ever use our ability to weaken a person's mental barriers thus allowing for suppressed feelings to come spilling out at an uncontrollable rate. To ensure it succeeds, we make sure the dreamscape is almost completely bare so they aren't distracted by the environment. The couch is just used to make them more comfortable to further weaken their guard.", she explained.Caleb thought for a second before pacing around to her left, her eyes following him to whole time. "That makes sense, I guess. So you're like in my head? Like, can you see my memories or whatever?""Well, not exactly. I can project myself in your dreams but I can't see memories because they're two completely different plains on the mental barrier. Have you ever had a dream of a memory? No.", she explained" huh, well can we make other things in this world? The whole endless void of nothingness vibe is started to make me feel isolated", he said looking around." I would dear, but that requires some energy. It takes a bit of effort to first project ourselves into others dreams. Plus, I've never really used this space for anything other than interrogation so I don't know where to begin.", she finished with a slight frown." Ahhh come on Mirabelle, just try something simple like-", he trailed off pondering as the mark on his chest began to glow. Mirabelle noticed and was awestruck. "Oh, how about a large field of flowers on a sunny day?".As soon as he said this the whole was filled with a bright warm light and an enormous field of flowers appeared all around them, filling the entire area in a sweet soothing fragrance.Mirabelle jaw dropped from astonishment as Caleb nodded approvingly. "See, there ya go."Mirabelle shook herself out of her trance her eyes still wide as dinner plates. "I-I-I-I…C-Caleb, I-I didn't do that. You did.", she uttered still in astonishment."Wait, Really? Oh, here imma try somethin'", he said closing his eyes concentrating. A big bucket of caramel popcorn appeared on the ground. He picked it up and tried some, uttering a delighted hum. It tasted great, the right balance of sweet and salty. "Here try some.", he said tilting the bucket towards her. She took some and hummed happily at the taste. She then had a thought to explain how it was possible."Caleb, these flowers and this popcorn, you've seen these before correct?", she asked."Uhhh, yeah. Those are daffodils, there's some marigolds, oh those are tiger lilies. You know, some of the flowers I saw at the botanical garden. And this just crackerjack popcorn I used to eat when I was a kid.", he said pointing at the flowers and popcorn bucket."Ah, now I think I understand why the scents and tastes feel so real. They're products of your experiences.", she said with a smirk.She then went up to him and placed a hand to the still glowing mark on his chest. Caleb looked down at it surprised that he just noticed. "That's not all, I believe that you may have inherited some of my power of dream control.""Seriously?!, so can I go into people's dreams now too?", he asked"I…don't think so. This ability may be limited to this dreamscape between us. From the looks of things, you have a lot of energy dear.", she explained tilting her head pensively."Hey, I'm an Otaku, a wild imagination come with the territory. At least we can still, enjoy ourselves . Go ahead, try and create something. Nothing big, just a little somethin' ", He said with enlivened emphasis.Mirabelle stood fidgeting a bit before saying, "OK, but...D-don't laugh.". She put her hands up and a small purple sphere appeared in front of her. Out of it came a small purple star shaped creature with beady black eyes, it flies around her making squeaking noises before resting on her shoulder."A luma?", he said with an incredulous grin"Y-yeah", she said meekly as the star creature affectionately rubbed against her cheek."hahaha, never took you for a fan of Mario. Think I'll get into character too.", he said wiping his hand around his body instantly changing his pajamas into blue overalls, purple shirt, and brown loafers. Finishing it off with white gloves, then snapped his fingers and a squiggly black mustache appeared on his face. "It's-a me, Caluigi", he said with a comical Italian accent.Mirabelle chuckled happily at his get-up. Suddenly a thought came to Caleb's attention. "Hey, Mirabelle" ."Yes, dear?", she said snapping herself to his attention."You know you don't have to take that form anymore. I prefer the real you, not some image of what you think I want. Ok?", he said.Her eyes widened with shock before slowly becoming affectionate and teary. "Y-YES!", she exclaimed delightedly reaching behind her and pulling out…a scythe. It looked to be about 5 feet long with a bright silver staff and golden blade at the end and gold crescent moon patterns on the blade surface. She it to her waist and swiftly cut across herself leaving a glowing violet light shine down to her legs. Her entire lower section began morphing into her horse body. Caleb looked onto the whole scene with utter befuddlement."Uhhhh, yeah…ok that's one way to do that. What is that exactly? Besides the obvious.", He said staring at the glistening blade."Oh. This is my dream scythe, I mostly use it to enter and exit the dreamscape. It can only exist in said dreamscape so it's kind of a part of me.", she explained before making it disappear in a cloud of purple mist."Huh, neat", Caleb said plainly, "Well Mirabelle, I think this marks the start of something undeniably kickass.""Hehe indeed, sweetheart", she said with a giggle."Oh, hey. Are you in my room right now in the real world?", he inquired."No, I'm in my room. Thanks to this, I can project myself anywhere you are.", she uttered with a toothy smile placing a hand on Caleb's chest."Wow, that's pretty cool. By the way, what's with calling me 'Dear' all of a sudden?", he inquiried" Its because you're so precious. Do you...not like it?", she said with a pout becoming worried."No, no, I like it. I was just caught off guard for a second. But I think it's fair I give you nickname too, just give me time I'll think of something.", he finished eating another piece of popcorn." oooh, I can't wait", she exclaimed with a delighted blush."Oh hey, I'm really sorry about talking to Sterling about...you know and telling him about the mark.", he said sorrowfully." Ah, well I kinda figured you were going to ask eventually, you're just protective like that. And the mark thing...I'm not really mad just a bit embarrassed. But I know for this cultural exchange to work we need to learn more about each other's people", she finished"OK, but I warn you, we have a lot to talk about.", he said winking." he he I'm all ears.", she giggled.And it's from that moment onwards that Caleb and Mirabelle became dream buddies. Every other night they'd create incredible adventures for themselves and in between learn even more about each other.After a few dream land adventures, Caleb decided on a name for them."Dream Masters?", Mirabelle inquired with a confused expression swirling a purple staff controlling a flock of multi-colored lumas."Yeah, I think it suits us. We're the masters of this world so why not?", Caleb explained firing a blaster at mini-tai fighters flying overhead."Well…it does sound rather enthralling. Ok, dear.", she said with a smile"ooh, we need a catchphrase too. How about…Lali-Ho?", he asked quickly blowing up three fighters, resulting in small explosions."Um, I think that's pushing it Caleb. Where'd you even come up with that?", she replied raising her eyebrow skeptically."It's from an anime I saw with these five guys looking for some vampire. Come on, give it a go. Say it with me. LALI-HO!", he finished as he walked over to her first his fist raised triumphantly."um…L-Lali-ho?", she said meekly pointing up a raised fist.Caleb stood next to her shaking his head. "Come on, put your soul into it. LALI-HO!", she giggled at his childish enthusiasm, before pumping her fist up with his. "LALI-HO" Mirabelle exclaimed embracing her new identity alongside Caleb.Soon enough the two became practically inseparable; both in the real world and the dreams. To the outside observer it would seem they've been best friends for years by how close they were. It wasn't long before Caleb saw another side of Mirabelle, that he didn't expect. Whenever they went out or Caleb's supervisor would come over, she would act more reserved. However, when they were alone, she was doting, a little sassy, astute, and sometimes even flirtatious. She became less soft-spoken and even a bit more…bold at times in the real world. Caleb didn't mind the change, in fact he felt proud of her from coming out of her shell. Even if it was mostly around him, but any progress is good progress. In truth, Caleb happy to have her around, to know he's making a real difference in another person's life. She was like the breath of life in his zombie-like existence. He eventually decided on a nickname for her—Moon pie—because she's mysterious yet warm and sweet.Comedic fast-forwarding to the presentWell now that we're all squared away let get back to the story.*PLAY*Caleb and Mirabelle had just finished their breakfast and now in the kitchen cleaning up the mess. Recently, Mirabelle started helping him out with making breakfast. She figured it was the least she could do since they were living together. Plus, it gave her opportunity to learn a few cooking skills. Now she can make pancakes with only a couple being a little burnt. Progress.Caleb was wiping off the powdery mix from the counter while Mirabelle hummed blissfully rinsing the plates. He couldn't help but think how she looked like a stereotypical house wife.After he had finished he went into the living and sat on the couch watching a morning news special. The newsman in navy blue suit and tie and white button-down underneath but his most prominent feature was his receding brown hairline. Next to him was a lamia woman with long green hair, bright emerald eyes, and green-yellow scales on the sides of her face. She had a curvy figure and prominent breasts. It was hard not to notice her entire bottom half was curled up in on herself behind the desk acting as her chair while tail poked through the top."In other news, local police and MON forces have arrested the suspects of an underground liminal fighting ring.", said the lamia woman as pictures of the suspects. A man who looked like that one creepy inmate in prison; completes with hokey tattoos and an Orc with golden rings on each ear and bright orange mohawk. She continued, "Both have been taken into custody and are awaiting their trial. The victims of these brutal and inhumane spectacles, many of whom are of the canine liminal breed, have been taken into Interspecies Affairs for medical treatment and psychological evaluation."Caleb flipped the channel to a movie with a man in a red and black dodging bullets in slow-motion. "Yeesh, the things these bastards won't do these days to earn a quick buck", he muffled with trace of disdain. Suddenly he felt two slender arms wrap around his neck resting on his chest and something big and soft rest against his upper back. He turned around to be met with a snarky grin on Mirabelle's face. He smiled back slightly flushed cupping her cheek with his hand."Well, someone's awfully touchy-feely today", he said playfully."This coming from the early morning groper?", she said furrowing her eyebrows."Touché, Moon pie, touché.", he replied with a wink.She pushed her breasts into his back a bit harder with a content hum as she lay her chin to at the nape of his neck.Oh boy, here we go again., he thought hiding his blush. Ever since the two dawned their personas as Dream Master's, Mirabelle became much more direct with her feelings. In the dreams, she was quite adventurous, energetic, and even possessive towards Caleb. Sometimes she'd create more suggestive dream scenarios. A private nudist beach, a co-ed Japanese hot spring, a winter snow lodge where they needed to snuggle closely for warmth. All these times she would always attempt to grind on him; speaking with a sultry voice all the while. At first Caleb wanted to talk to her about it but chalked it up to her taking his advice seriously. Eventually he decided to simply let her have her fun. They were just dreams. They weren't breaking the law or anything.However, he noticed that Mirabelle began to act progressively more flirtatious in the real world. The displays were relatively harmless with the occasional hugs and platonic kisses but have since become more...audacious. Caleb really didn't mind it too much but was still cautious to not be seen by Sterling in any compromising positions. And no not THAT kind of position.She shifted a bit pressing her breasts further into his back, " what are you watching dear? It looks rather violent.", she said wincing at the man shooting three guys with one bullet".Caleb reached up and lightly caressed her cheek " Well it is deadpool after all, the guy isn't exactly known for his negotiation skills.". He noticed that she was growing more uncomfortable until he took her hand into his getting her attention. " hey, I can turn it if you want. I know you get queasy over bloodshed ".She giggled slightly poking his cheek, " hehe, nah I can handle it if it's just a movie. Besides it gives an excuse to cuddle with my dear.", she said pushing herself a bit more and nibbling his ear. Caleb froze for a second as her warm lips touched his earlobe.Ok, this is an experience. Can't say I don't like it though, but I should stop her in case-, his thought was then interrupted by a knock on his front door. Getting up from his position, much to Mirabelle's dismay-putting on her signature Moon pie pout.Caleb opened the front door and stand on the other side was an older man, about a few years older than him. He had pale skin, green eyes, and wore thin framed glass. He was fairly taller than Caleb at least a foot and had a skinny but slightly muscular frame. He wore black khakis with black leather shoes and a green collared shirt with a symbol on side like Caleb's-solid yellow triangle made of arrow with atom model in the middle."Good morning, Rodney", Caleb politely greeted the man as he welcomed him in." Mornin' Caleb, how you doing?", he said with a gruff Southern accent."Fine. So, shall we get started? I spent yesterday in the office finishing up the data analysis for the blades toughness and airflow and created a short CAD simulation for the support lines approximate tensile strength.", he explained casually while oblivious to Mirabelle confused expression." That's great Caleb, I'll just need to collect the draft and save a copy of the simulation for the development team ", he said." Alright, let's go to my office.", he said showing the man into his home. The man walked through the living room shooting a smile at Mirabelle causing her to tense up nervously."Ah, Good mornin' Ma'am, how you doing?", he asked as she lightly jumped from addressing her suddenly." I-I'm, fine", she said meekly avoiding eye contact.Suddenly Caleb came up from behind and spoke to her, "we'll be done in a little bit Mirabelle. Later I'll show you a few American classics on Netflix, k?", he inquired giving her the 'it's alright' face.She felt her entire body loosen from hearing his voice as a smile grew on her face." Ok dear. I'll be out in the garden tending to the violet. They're already sprouting.", she said coolly.She went out of the sliding doors as the two men made they're way into Caleb's office. It was filled with large drafting schematics hanging in different places. A desk with designing and measuring utensils on it and droors filled with other supplies. There was an adjustable swivel chair at another desk where his Apple desktop computer sat."Heh, man she still isn't used to me huh?", Rodney questioned" Yeah, she's just really shy around most people. Give it more time she'll get used to you.", Caleb said opening the CAD files on his computer."Well, she ain't having any trouble being around you. Huh, dear?", he jeered with a chuckle." You're one to talk. I'm surprised your homestay even let you out of the house", Caleb retorted raising an eyebrow." Hey, even Scyllas need their space. Plus, it helps she's a heavy sleeper. ", he rumenated with a grin." ha yeah, anyway he's where the cross section allows for the airflow to pass ", Caleb said showing the design on the computer.*******1 hour later******After finishing up their work Caleb saw Rodney off with the designs to take to the development team. Caleb was in the kitchen making a pitcher of lemonade as Mirabelle walked in from outside fanning herself with her purple sunhat."Hot enough for ya, Moon pie?", he said jokingly handing her a glass full."Haha very funny", she teasingly before gulping down the drink. She let out a rejuvenated gasp after finishing it, " so good."Caleb giggled about to pour himself a glass before his phone rang. He answered it putting the glass down."Hello? Yeah...uh-huh...yeah OK...Thanks for the heads up, yeah.", he finished hanging up the phone." who was that?", Mirabelle asked"Agent Sterling. He says he's coming by for something important. It must be if he's calling first, usually he just breaks in.", he explained." what do you think he wants?", she asked ignoring the last part."Not sure, probably just checking to make sure we're not up to anything illegal? You know, the usual.", his finished in a humdrum tone moving over to the couch and taking a seat as Mirabelle adjusted a part of the couch and did the same.Caleb changed the channel to another movie of a man and a woman holding each other in freezing waters. Mirabelle sat looking down pensively in silence for a solid minute. He soon noticed something was up and asked her, " Mirabelle, you alright?".She shifted a bit as she took occasional glances at Caleb.He moved closer to her and repeated rocked side to side playfully nudging her shoulder with his."Come on, moon pie, what's on your mind?", he said with a goofy expression. Mirabelle looked up at him with glazed eyes before a light blush came on her cheek. He felt his heart race and face became more serious." Caleb, are...those laws really that important?", she said pressing her chest to his arm inciting a blush from him. ",is it really illegal to love someone?", she finished guiding his hand to her inner front legs. On reflex he gave a light squeeze causing her to quietly moan.Caleb mentally backhanded himself before slowly pulling his arm free. She gave him a worried expression before he cupped he face forcing her to look at him."Moon pie, believe me, I know how you feel.", he said brushing her violet strands, "But you know why we can't do this and you know what will happen to both of us if we're caught. I refuse to lose you."She lay her head to his shoulder and clutched her hand to his. She looked up at the movie playing a scene where the woman let's go of her dead lover as he sinks into the ocean. A tear came to eye as she clutched his hand tighter."Yes...I do, dear. But, it gets frustrating sometimes. I just...want to do...more, show how much you mean to me. Not just in our dreams.", she said with a slight melancholy.Caleb ruminated thinking of their quality time they spent in their world. He understood what she meant. Despite how real it all seems, they're still only dreams. They can't compare to real intimacy."I know Mirabelle, but one moment of heated, unrestrained passion isn't worth losing you. God, I wish they'd amend that section in the bill already. Why is America so fuckin' obstinate?", he said with clear irritation.Mirabelle placed her other hand into his getting his attention as he saw the trust in her eyes." Dear, it's alright. I will never leave you. I'll just keep letting my feelings out in your dreams, they can't take that from us. Plus...the wait is definitely worth it.", she reassured him finishing with wink.Caleb chuckled before placing a kiss to her forehead. She responded by applying her own to his cheek.What he did to earn the affection of someone like he'll never know.Suddenly they heard a knock at the door startling them both to jump out of each other's embrace-giving each other flustered glances before Caleb stood up."Coming!", he called out heading to the door.He opened it revealing Agent Sterling on the front porch. He looked behind him and saw a black van and two men in uniforms similar to Sterling's." Good Afternoon, Mr. Baizzel", he stated"Ugghh, it's Bizzell", Caleb said through his gritted teeth."Haha, I know. I just never get tired of that face you always make. Like this.", he said distorting his face.Caleb let out an exasperated sigh, " Please tell me what this is about Sterling"."Right, well it involves your status as a host. You've been doing so well for the program, that we're entrusting you with the care of another student.", he finished as he pointed to opening back door of the van.Before Caleb could voice his opinion the van doors opened with loud clang. A figure leapt out and to Sterling's side. Standing beside him was a young fair-skinned woman of average height a petite but somewhat muscular figure, messy grey-black hair, and kind but critical golden irises. Her arms and legs were covered in grey-black fur and ended in clawed canine-like paws with pads in her palms. She still had five digits. Her fluffy erect canine ears stood on the top of her head with small silver earrings in them. She wore a pair of denim shorts that formed nicely around her tight round rear with hole in the back to allow her bushy tail to poke through. She wore a dark blue sleeveless cut top with a white full moon design that curved around her breasts, which were just a few sizes smaller than Mirabelle's. She had silver brace rings on her wrists. She stood with a proud but playful stature placing her hands to her hips and narrowing her eyes at Caleb."This is-", Sterling was then cut off by the young woman." HEY, grandpa, I can introduce myself ", she barked at him surprising him and Caleb. Sterling grimaced a bit at her. She circled Caleb sniffing him from head to toe before stopping in front of him." Uh, howdy ma'am, I'm Caleb Bizzell.", Caleb said extending his hand slowly."Sup, Caleb? I'm Lyca Kessler. You smell good, way better than the last human. Guy was huge smoker.", she said before taking Caleb's hand in a vicelike grip.After releasing he casually rubbed his hand with an embarrassed grin, "hooooooo child, little lady big handshake". Lyca rubbed the back of her head smugly with a giggle. ," hehe, your kinda tough yourself. You're alright." , she finished wrapping and arm around his neck as her tail wagged energetically.Suddenly a thought came to Caleb's attention. "Alright Sterling what's the catch? You wouldn't have called about this being important if there wasn't additional information you needed to tell us.", he said with a skeptical tone." heh, perceptive as usual kid. Shall we continue this inside, it's hotter than Lucifer's loins out here. ", he said fanning himself with a manila document." Of course, I've got a pitcher of lemonade in the freezer. I'll fix y'all some", he said.They all walked in as Lyca clung to Caleb giving him a noogie and Sterling took a seat a the kitchen counter. Mirabelle then came in after leaving the bathroom."Dear, is Sterling here? Did he tell you...what was...so...important", Mirabelle uttered as she saw the man she loved being hugged by another woman. A look of horror came on her face and her mind began to play scenario after scenario; none of them good." Oh hey, Mirabelle. Yeah we're actually about to discuss some things. Oh, this is Lyca. Lyca Kessler, she's gonna be staying with us. She's a werewolf. ", Caleb explained." Wassup . Guess we're roomies.",she chuckled still holding Caleb."W-W-W-W-Wha-", she was then interrupted as Sterling caught their attention." If we're done with introduction, we need to get down to business. Ms. Kessler please take a seat.", he said as Lyca emitted a low growl and sat at the counter.******Later*****"So, let me get this straight.", Caleb began adjusting his glasses, "You brought Lyca here from her previous host because he was involved with...""An underground liminal fighting ring, yes. We were lucky that we found out before he could enter her into one of them.", Sterling interjected taking a drink of lemonade.Mirabelle stood near the couch sipping her drink taking occasional glances at Lyca. Who sat crossed armed brooding in irritation at Sterling before Caleb placed some lemonade and a plate full of Tyson chicken tenders in front of her catching her attention. She thanked him and happily gobbled up the food" Apparently, he had signed up for the Exchange specifically to find strong, obedient fighters. That changed as soon as the ring leaders were arrested along with anyone else involved.", he said with a hint of disgust.Caleb looked at Mirabelle who had and expression on her face that could only be described as shocked. He saw Lyca was still eating but had her ears perked up listening to their every word."How did you not find this out sooner?", Caleb asked incredulously." Look I wasn't directly in charge of placing her there, that was another agent who botched up the background check on the guy. Even the neighborhood he lived was not a safe environment for exchange students. The higher ups were not pleased, I'll tell you what. He's been put probation. I'm just glad we got to her before the worst happened. ", he explained.Caleb wanted to berate him further but held himself back. Instead he gave a content smile. " Yeah, I'm glad she's safe too. That's all that really matters.", he finished as Lyca looked at him with surprise. Mirabelle looked from Caleb to Lyca simultaneously feeling glad and concerned."We wanted to put her in a more stable home but unfortunately most of the host families in the area have filled their vacancies. This was the only other place with extra room. So, Mr. Bizzell will please watch over Ms. Kessler for the duration of the program?", Sterling askedCaleb glanced over at Mirabelle who was stiff with anticipation then at Lyca who gave him an almost pleading expression but still trying the keep up a proud stature." Sure, there's plenty of room for all of us in Casa dé Caleb. Plus, it's kinda my policy to help anyone if I'm well within means to do so.", he saidLyca's eyes grew wide joy as her pearly white fangs gleamed through her big smile. In a flash, she put Caleb in a back breaking hug nuzzling his chest. " Thank you, thank you, thank you, oh you will not regret. Feels so good to have a new pack."."Pack?", Caleb asked." Well yeah, we're a pack now. You, me, and the quivering horse lady. Seriously, is she sick or somethin'", she questioned pointing a claw at Mirabelle who's entire form was shaking wildly as she blushed brightly and her eyes had little cartoonish spirals in them."Hey, Moon pie, you alright. Do you need to lie down? Hang on, I'll make ya something to perk you right up", he said getting out of Lyca's grip heading for the kitchen." T-That's alright dear. Thanks anyway.", she muttered feeling more at ease from his concern for her."Moon pie? Dear? What's this all about", Sterling asked with suspicion to which Lyca pulled back look between Caleb and Mirabelle.Caleb pinched the bridge of his nose with a sigh, " look don't get the wrong idea, it's natural for friends to give each other nicknames. ", Sterling was about to give a retort before Caleb continued, " and yes, we know. Sexual relations are illegal, prison for me, deportation for them. We got it." He finished as Sterling raised an eyebrow before shrugging off his suspicion. Both the girls blinked comically at Caleb before Lyca started chuckling silently."Alright, Mr. Bazzle on behalf of the entire program I thank you for your continued participation. I'll just go get Ms. Kessler's care package on everything you need about her. The movers will be here shortly with her things. I'll let you decide which vacant room she'll occupy.", he finished taking out a flask from his shirt pocket then walking to his car."Got it, and for God sake it's BIZZELL.", Caleb finished in an annoyed tone."Hahahahaha, man gramps wasn't kidding when he said you were funny. Im'ma love it here.", she laughed clutching her stomach.Caleb shook his head as Mirabelle gave her a disapproving glare.Sterling came back in with a large manila folder and Lyca's care package, following him were two men carrying two large camp duffle bags, a punching bag, and a training dummy littered with claw marks. Caleb guided them to the vacant room next to his.After moving in Lyca's belongings and signing all the transfer forms, Sterling did a brief assessment on Mirabelle's adjustment before leaving the Bizzell household. Caleb gave Lyca a tour of the house all the while Mirabelle kept a close eye on them.A couple hours had passed, and Lyca was finished getting settled in. The two liminals were sitting in living room-Lyca playing Mortal Kombat XL and Mirabelle reading 'The Great Gatsby'-while Caleb was in the kitchen." Yeah, get some ya punk ass ghost rider lookin' bastard. Yeahhhhhh, I'm alpha chick up in this muddafucka. ", Lyca exclaims doing a little victory dance as the announcer says "Eron Black wins". Mirabelle occasionally looked up at the ecstatic wolf girl cautiously." Hey Moon pie, do you want cheddar or mozzarella", he asked finishing her zucchini casserole."Oh, um, either is fine dear", she said snapping out of her thoughts. Lyca looked at the kitchen then at Mirabelle who quickly went back to reading avoiding eye contact. A smirk grew on Lyca's face. She then slid down the couch to be closer to Mirabelle." So you two seem real close. And I mean reallll close", she said wiggling her eyebrows.Mirabelle froze for a second before mentally shaking off her fear and composing herself enough to answer, "I-I don't know what you are insinuating, but yes I do care for him and much as he does me.""I didn't mean anything by it, I just noticed how you two look at each other. Like two best friends who've known each other all your lives. It's sweet. You two are a good pair.", she said with a smile.Mirabelle was surprised by her candid statement but simply accepted the compliment. "A-ah, well thank you Ms. Kessler.""Oh, come on, just call me Lyca. Formalities are for important events and old people", Lyca said with a toothy grin., " OK then, Lyca"."There we go. But uh, there is one thing, kind of a request really.", Lyca said" oh, of course, what is it?", said Mirabelle."I want in on it too.", Lyca said plainly as Mirabelle blinked comically at the statement, " um, I beg your parden?"" I want to be Caleb's girl too. He's kind, smart, pretty strong, and really funny." She said plainly."W-W-What!? What are you talking about?", Mirabelle asked incredulously"Its tradition among werewolves to share a single mate. That way no one is left out in the cold broken hearted and everyone gets to be with the person they love. However, in every pack there exists a single alpha pair. An alpha male and the alpha female. The others are simply betas and are like subordinates to the alphas.", she explained wrapping arm around Mirabelle's shoulder who tensed from the wolf girl's strength." B-B-But what does-", Mirabelle was about to ask before Lyca silenced her with free clawed finger. " What I'm getting at horsey is that I'm challenging you for position as alpha female. Come at me with everything you got. But be warned, I won't back down easy."Mirabelle sat in utter shock at what she was hearing. This woman just openly declared that she was going after Caleb yet simultaneously encouraged her to try her hardest to make Caleb hers. Before Mirabelle could say anything further, they were both interrupted by Caleb."Girls, suppertime. Come and get it while it's hot." , he exclaimed from the dining room.As soon as her said this, Lyca went sprinting, tongue hanging out, to the table as Mirabelle sat still on the couch dumbfounded."Oh boy, tenderloin!", Lyca exclaimed before happily tearing at her steak." Hey, don't forget them veggies now. That some perfectly good broccoli. ", he said patting her head as her tail wagged wildly." Got it, Chief ", she said her mouth full of meat." Moon pie, come on before you food gets cold", he called out to the other room.I...I can't lose him. I won't lose him. To anyone. I'll be brave, I'll protect us, my dear. , Mirabelle thought motivating herself as her resolve made purple aura of determination flare around her."...uh...Mirabelle?...", Caleb inquired causing her to squeal in surprise., " Dinner's ready, Moon pie. Let's eat before big bad wolf gobbles up our goodies.""Y-Yes, of course dear. She said with a smile.WOW, that was wayyyyyy longer than I originally intended, but hey more material for you guys am I right? Heh. So, I like how Lyca's character is looking so far. I wanted to go for a bit of a tomboyish, honest, and straight-forward thinking personality with a dash of perversion. I really like how Caleb and Mirabelle are developing and hope to utilize their dream sequence adventures in mini-series I like to call 'DreamMasterz' *distant voice echoes the name*. Somewhere, down the line I plan to include more monster girls. Some will be a surprise, others will be selected by poll. Next girl will be one I really want to do, and I won't spoil the surprise but I will say, she's a real charmer. Alright, as always thank you for reading. Please comment, fav, and all that stuff. Til' next time, Fam.
  
    Chapter Text
    Chapter 5: Wolf in Sheepish clothingWriter's NotesOk Fam, here we are again. I know you missed me as much as missed you. Man, these last few weeks have been a trial. Started a new job because my previous one had become a saturated with unreliable employees who couldn't pick up the slack, and guess received the brunt of his boss's agitation. So yeah I just dipped as soon as I found a better opportunity. This chapter I am hoping to try and build some understanding of Lyca's personality and hope her and Mirabelle can find some common ground. Now as usual if you have any opinions on the story so far and how it can improve, please leave it in comments or PM me. Well, that's enough of my prattle, onward to the story.It was later that night after dinner. Everyone in the Bizzell household had turned in and were in their rooms asleep. Well…almost everyone.Mirabelle lay on her side in her bed staring at the wall in contemplation. A vase of lavender flowers sat on her windowsill as the starry night sky filled her senses with cold uncertainty. It's not like it wasn't uncommon for her to be up that late, her species didn't require much sleep anyway, but this night she was undoubtedly worried. She ran her hand through her lavender strands trying to massage away her anxiety. She had been contemplating using her ability on Lyca for a good two hours now, but she was too afraid of just what she would find. That wolf was so upfront and honest about her intentions there wasn't the slightest hesitation in her words yet she gave off this very strange aura. After her encounter with...him...she didn't want to chance running into another violent encounter with a deeply suppressed subconscious. Besides, she decided to herself long ago that Caleb was the only person who's dreams she ever wanted to go into.It's no use, I just can't work up the nerve to do so. I'll just have to ask Caleb., she thought adjusting her position so she was kneeling her entire lower body on the bed with her legs firmly tucked in. She closed her eyes and cupped her hands meditatively. Then her eyes shot open suddenly glowing a bright violet light. She felt her entire body become like stone as part of her consciousness left her physical body.In Caleb's room he was fast asleep after checking over emails from work, gaming messages, and posts from a fanfiction he wrote 5 months ago out of boredom. He should really finish it. On his night stand was brown file folder with information on Lyca's species that he's been reading over after dinner.~DreamMasterz~Caleb stood in the dreamscape in his white t-shirt and grey pajama bottoms wistfully whistling to himself. He was interrupted as he noticed the mark on his chest glowing followed by the familiar sight of Mirabelle stepping through a portal into his dreams. Putting away her scythe, she changing her attire from pajamas to a simple violet evening gown partially covering her horse-half and a dark purple v-neck that hugged her curves and gave a good view of her ample cleavage. He gave a content grin."Hehe you're a bit later than usual. Well, let's get started.", he finished with a snap of his finger as the entire surroundings began changing into a Mediterranean themed restaurant setting with noticeable Southern influences like several state flags hanging from the rafters. The two stood on the outside patio on the 2nd floor looking over the pristine ocean as the evening sunset created a cascade of vibrant colors reflecting from the water surface. Over in the distance were dozens of tall heavily lit buildings juxtaposed with the faint sounds of blaring car horns and bell tolls made by boats from the pier pulling into dock. Mirabelle looked at the surroundings in wonder; pleasantly sniffing the air which was laden with the salty scent of the ocean and delicious food from inside the restaurant."Beautiful right? And before you ask, no this isn't from any anime or movie. This is just a restaurant I went with my uncle and cousin in Georgia one Summer. Of course, i put my own little spin on it.", Caleb said pointing at the ocean down below the side of the patio. A colossal blue whale-like creature came leaping out of the water over their heads then landing on the other side of the restaurant with a huge splash like Free Willy. Caleb snapped his fingers creating a huge umbrella to shield them both. It was the legendary pokemon Kyogre, one of Caleb's favorites."Woo, that just never gets old! So what should...we...", he ceased his excited outburst after noticing Mirabelle's despondent expression. He grew worried. This was the first time in a long time he's seen Mirabelle upset while in their dream world. Caleb then cupped her cheek in hand forcing her gaze to meet his."Moon pie, what wrong? Come on, you know you can tell me anything here. It's a safe spa-oh, wait a sec.", he closed his eyes and concentrated. Ten fully armed soldiers in high-grade battle armor appeared around the perimeter of the patio standing guard, "Ok, now it's an even safer space". Mirabelle let out a snorted giggle before being embraced in a tight hug by the young man."You are incorrigible dear.", she whispered nuzzling her head into his chest."Heh, hey it come with the territory of being me. Now, tell me what's eating at you.", he finished snapping a stack of lavender scented pillows arranged in the shape of a giant circular bed. Mirabelle shook her head with a smile easing herself into the structure sitting with her human."Caleb. I...well it's about Lyca.", she said as Caleb gave her his full attention, "I'm not sure how to say this but...I don't have a good feeling about her"."Well she did start living with us just several hours ago. Give it some time moon pie, you'll get used to her.", he said assuredly stroking her horse back. He knew she was still shy around most people so it wasn't surprising she'd feel that way towards Lyca."I know, and I understand her circumstance...but you seemed a bit quick to allow her to stay with us. I know that's the way you are though. You saw she was in trouble and helped her. I could imagine what she's been through believing you're in a seemingly safe environment only to proven terribly wrong.", she said looking away musingly."Yeah, not gonna lie, I wasn't 100% sure about it myself. Sterling kind of put me on the spot and I just kinda rolled with it. But like you said, she was in trouble and I most certainly, no matter the circumstance, was going to help her. I hate to imagine what would have happened to her if the program agents didn't find her in time. But hey, she seems to likes it here so far, so I think we'll all get along well.", he finished with a confident smile.Mirabelle fidgeted for a minute messing with one of the pillows. Noticing this he gently took her hand getting her attention before saying, "I know that's not all. Lay it allllllll on me Moon pie.""O-ok. While you were cooking, she and I had a conversation.", she said in a uncertain tone."What was it about? if you don't mind me asking.", He said still respecting her privacy.Mirabelle blushed slightly remembering her words. " Well she commented on close we seemed to be and was essentially said she was happy for us.""Ah, well that's not really something to be embarrassed about. I-", He stopped when Mirabelle placed a finger to his lips. " Then it got quite bizarre. She started going on about how she wanted in on it, and how she was challenging me for 'alpha female'. I don't know what she meant but...I'm afraid she may do something that'll get us all in trouble with the exchange program. ""Hmmm that would be problematic. And the 'alpha female' thing? What's that abo-", Caleb muttered before he suddenly remembered something, "Ahhh, now I get it. Moon pie I actually read a little about her species before turning in for the night. Apparently, werewolves are a proud bunch that enjoy testing their mental and physical strength. They live in these hierarchial groups with alphas at the top and Omegas at the very bottom just like normal wolves. Ranks are determined by competing amongst each other through ritualized trials of their choosing to find the strongest among them. It seems they can be pretty violent in that endeavor but they mainly rely on psychological intimidation and their cunning to subdue their opponent and they're surprisingly fair fighters."Mirabelle shuddered a bit from hearing the last part. "What exactly does that have to do with it?", she asked slightly apprehensive."Well she's a lone wolf living with two complete strangers and still adjusting to a new world. I guess when she saw how we were and she felt like just some outsider. Her instincts likely took over to establish a sense of belonging in a new pack. That's my guess at least. Tell me, was she at all hostile towards you when she challenged you?", Caleb explained." Well, no. In fact, she seemed to try and encourage me to try and beat her.", Mirabelle said in a matter-of-fact tone."See? She's in a new environment and she's doing her best to bring some sense of control in her life. I guess her pride is making her have to earn her place.", he said." B-But I don't want to fight her or anything. I...I just...", she started to whimper out before Caleb massaged her back calming her."You won't have to get into a physical fight just face her in a game of wits. Give a little challenge to make her feel more at ease with herself. Play some Fighterz or play one of my board games. Don't think of it as a battle for supremacy more like a...bonding experience. And don't worry, I'll be there to mediate so things don't get out of hand.", he finished in a reassuring voice.Mirabelle let out a sigh of relief at his words, she still felt worried, but more at ease. "O-Ok dear, I'll try my best. Goodness how are you so inciteful for your age?""Sweetheart, I had a therapist for a mom, psychoanalysing people has become an odd habit of mine.", Caleb said with a light chuckle." Ah, that makes...a little too much sense.", she uttered with a slight sarcastic giggle." yeah well, it comes with the terri-Ahapha!", Caleb spat out patting his belly as a sudden tingling sensation on lower stomach. As if something sharp just brushed passed his skin."Caleb?! What's wrong?!", she exclaimed." Nothing, it's nothing probably just a itch or something on my body in the real world. Sorry I startled you.", he said rubbing to spot on his stomach. Mirabelle simply gave a nod before leaning into him so they were shoulder to shoulder. She let out a content sigh as she and Caleb enjoyed the sunset."Hey, you thirsty?", he said snapping his fingers creating a slim, good-looking in traditional butler attire holding a tray with two glasses filled with white wine. He knelt down and they both took a glass."Will that be all sir", the attractive man said in a very regal tone., " yes, thank you Sebastian. As timely as ever.""Of course sir, I'm not one hell of a butler for nothing", the man said with a courteous bow before disappearing in a poof of purple smoke." Really?", Mirabelle said raising an eyebrow to which Caleb lightly shrugged., "ooh, dearearn't look now but...moon stick", she said with a smile creating a pink wand with a yellow crescent moon then pointed it upwards making circles with it. They looked upwards to see a colossal butterfly with a rounded body covered in brightly colored fur and six small bird-like legs circling the restaurant. With every flap of it's multicolored wings, the brightly colored dust left a cascading ring of illuminating light; and in the middle, 'DreamMaster4ever'. The two looked at each other with loving smiles." I had a feeling showing my kaiju movie collection was a good idea.", Caleb said with a snarky wink as Mirabelle gave him a peck on the cheek, "You're so easy to please Caleb"." Lali-ho.", they both said with a klink of their glasses and a short but passionate kiss.In the back of her mind though, Mirabelle knew she didn't tell everything. She couldn't tell him the challenge was because of him. It cgirlsmake things worse if he intervened. Besides, she wanted to try and deal with this herself first.The next morningA peaceful and serene Summer morning enraptured the entire town in a warm blanket of soft sun rays. The birds could be heard singing their jubilant melody as a light breeze came rasping through the trees caring with it the scent of freshly cut grass. Young children going outside enjoying their well deserved break from school and adults went off to work after a hearty breakfast. Ah yes, a calm, quiet morning in the town of Huntsville for everyone...unless you're Caleb Bizzell."GAHHHHH WHAT THE FUCK?!", the young man exclaimed falling out of his bed backwards with a loud thud. He rubbed the back of his to ease of pain of hitting his head on the floor. He then heard the disjointed chuckles of his wolf girl house guest sitting up on his bed energetically slapping her knee. She had on a simple black exposed belly button T-shirt and black high cut brief panties."Damn chief, that's a hell of wake up call. Careful, we may just get noise complaints if every morning will be like this", she started with a slight cocky tone."Mornings won't be like this if YOUR not in here UNANNOUNCED! Speaking of, WHY are you in my bedroom?", Caleb growled through his teeth."Whoa calm down chief. Well if we're gonna be living here I think it's best we get used to each other real quick. We've passed formal introduction and ate our first dinner together. So the next logical step was to enjoy a good nights sleep together. It's common ritual we werewolves use to get settled into a pack. By the way, you're an excellent cuddler.", she finished with a wink coyly pointing a clawed finger at Caleb's blushing face.Caleb let out an exasperated sigh massaging away the migraine forming near his temple, "OK, Lyca, I don't know much about werewolf culture and am happy to learn, but with us humans it's kinda frowned upon to sneak into sleeping person's room in the middle of the night.""Ah come on, you REALLY think I'd do that to just any human? Nah, just you chief. You are something special. I could tell from when first met ya that you're an upstanding guy.", she said with a proud smirk getting down on the floor with her host. Caleb blushed slightly as her thigh lightly brushed against his leg."You've haven't been here a full day yet, how are you so sure about that assessment?", Caleb asked incredulously looking away slightly embarrassed of the position they're in."Chief, when I arrived on your doorstep I sized you up THOROUGHLY. My mom taught me how to spot the bigots and fakers who only act nice in front of people like us. When I talked to you you didn't falter in your speech, you didn't have any sort of malice, distrust, or criticism in your eyes, and your stature was unflinching yet accepting. Trust me, unlike that other dick head I had the misfortune of staying with, you're great guy.", she finished with slightly shaky tone near the end then beaming a toothy grin showing off her razor sharp white fangs.Caleb was caught off guard by her impeccably forthright explanation and just settled on accepting the compliment. Suddenly, he his door flew open dramatically which caught his and Lyca's attention. There stood in her dark purple button down sailor moon pajama top with matching sheet-like gown the distressed Mirabelle." Caleb, are you alright?! I heard... Screa...ming...", she exclaimed before registering the sight in front of her. The expression began to morph from concern to utter shock and hurt. She was about to let out a distressed shriek before Caleb quickly stopped her."Whoa, OK moon pie, before we turn into a crappy anime cliché, allow me to explain what's going on here. Besides I already got a bit of a headache.", Caleb said standing up from his awkward position. As he did though, Lyca got up too putting an elbow to his shoulder leaning on him casually with a smirk aimed at Mirabelle who stood in disbelief. This action incited an annoyed sigh from Caleb. This girl was NOT helping at all."Ok, so SHE snuck into MY bedroom at night while I was dead asleep. Apparently, because of a tradition among her people to join a new family. That's it. Nothing happened at all.", Caleb said gesturing to Lyca then noticing Mirabelle's face soften a bit choosing to believe him. She had no reason not to trust him but...still." heh, speak for yourself there chief", Lyca said with a wink toward Caleb. Both Caleb and Mirabelle looked at her stunned in confusion, "Ha, the looks on your faces! But no, seriously it's true, I just snuggled up with him for the night. You know getting to know my new leader...on a personal level.", she finished with a slight cooing tone. Mirabelle mouth hung agape as she looked over to an obviously annoyed Caleb pinching the bridge of nose between his eyes. He then moved of to the side almost making Lyca fall over and picked up his phone. It was 7:15 am." Alright girls that's enough tomfoolery for right now, get washed up, breakfast in one hour. I need to get dressed so I'm gonna need y'all to bounce.", he said plainly.Mirabelle expression began to loosen slightly at his words but she was still wary of the werewolf next to him. Lyca looked a bit puzzled before saying, "Hey chief why don't you go wash up first you are man of the house. Ooh you know what? To make things more efficient, how about we ALL use the bath together?! That way we'll all get clean as a pack.", she said with delighted gaze and a slight blush. Caleb felt his heart quicken and his cheeks burned." W-WHAAAT!?", Mirabelle exclaimed cupping her mouth as her entire face burned so bright red steam came out of her ears like Popeye as her eyes became purple cartoon spirals."Ahem, no Lyca were are not doing...that. I already had a good shower last night. You ladies go on wash up.", he finished calming himself down after Moon pie's outburst.Both liminals met each other's gaze until Mirabelle, startled by the wolf girl's toothy smile that exposed her fangs, looked away fearfully much to Lyca's confusion."OK, outoutout, I need to get dressed", he said shooing the werewolf out of his room to give him privacy. She passed Mirabelle giving a good pat on the back."Well, you heard the chief horsey, better hurry while the waters good and hot.", she said scampering off to the bathroom. Before Caleb closed his door, Mirabelle stopped him and looked him in the eyes despairingly."C-Caleb I...", she whimpered out before he silenced her pressing a finger to her lip."Moon pie, its OK, you have nothing to worry about.", he said encouragingly petting to top of her head making a smile grow on her face. She felt a surge of new found strength flow through her as she peered into her human's caring brown eyes. Unbeknownst to them, a pair of wolf ears had been peaking around the corner of the bathroom door before receding out of sight.She gave an excited nod and turned around made way for the bathroom with the sound of Caleb's door closing signaling that there was no turning back.Ok, time to get to work, Caleb thought putting on some light brown slacks and a grey shirt with his company logo on it. On his way out of his room, he looked down at the bathroom door as faint wisps of steam from the waters came seeping the bottom crack. The faint sound of talking and water splashing could be heard. Caleb gave a content smile before heading off to start breakfast. He felt glad to hear the girls getting along well especially for Mirabelle for giving Lyca a chance. Now then, breakfast. He's got two ladies with monster appetites to feed....Meanwhile..."AHHH, Ms. Kessler please..", Mirabelle exclaimed as the young werewolf continued splashing more warm water at her."Hahahahaha come on now, I said to call me Lyca. Also, we're in a bath tub that's a freakin' swimming pool. Where's your child-like wonder?", she chuckled as she splashed another big wave at Mirabelle's face."*hack* oh dear gods you made me swallow some of the bath water. ", Mirabelle coughed out as the werewolf took a seat outside the tub edge with a slight smirk wiping the sweat from her forehead. She then let out a deep sigh." I was just trying to loosen you up a bit. You know, you sure aren't nearly what I expected when I was told a centaur a was living here too. I heard you guys were supposed to be a noble race of courageous, strong warriors; but I don't get that from you. You're kinda shy, nervous...and a bit skittish. What's up with that?", Lyca finished in a slightly disappointed tone."W-Well, y-you see I'm from a centaur subspecies called Nightmares. We...don't believe in fighting or any form of violence.", Mirabelle sheepishly explained adjusting the towel around her large mounds of flesh."For real? How does a species like that earn such a badass name then?!", Lyca asked incredulously standing up quickly causing her own towel to fall off completely."I-It's mostly because of our...well...unnatural appearance.", she said pointing at her purple furred horse body and almost wispy purple tail."Man, talk about judging a book by its cover.", Lyca said examining her paws, "Guess some things never change.""Y-yeah", said Mirabelle."So yeah, I'm gonna have to change up my approach to how we decide who'll be Caleb's alpha female. But it has to still be challenging for both of us otherwise what's the point if it's one sided.", Lyca crossed her arms thinking to herself." B-But why do we have to do that? Why do we have to compete? I'm sure he cares about both of us.", Mirabelle asked contentiously."That cute but you don't need to sugar coat it. I seen how he looks at you, he adores you. I knew as soon as I stepped through that door you two have an incredibly deep bond. But...what am I here...just someone to get in the way of that? Just some nuisance that was taken in out of pity?", she said looking away sadly clutching her paws together until she shook her head trying to drive out her bad memories, "Ahem, so...that's why I'm challenging you, I'll earn my place here and his affection. A true wolf goes after what they want with all they got."Mirabelle blinked at her statement feeling a bit more understanding of her. Suddenly Mirabelle remembered Caleb's advice from last nights dream, " T-Then h-how about we play a game? Something to test our mental sharpness and tenacity. A test of wits and the ability to adapt to change."Lyca's ears perked up attentively as a intrigued smirk grew on her face. "I'm listening.""W-Well I see that you're also quite proficient with that device called a PS4, so we should do that. The best...4 out of 5 matches is the...um, the alpha.", Mirabelle stated trying hilariously to sound intimidating and failing.Lyca got up and walked over to Mirabelle, much to latter's concern, and stood in front with her arms crossed with her tail swaying penitently. " heh good enough for me, besides wolves are known for our cunning. I'm not gonna lose but you better try your hardest.", Lyca finished tucking her towel to her cleavage with a wide smile staring Mirabelle down."S-so you're fine with that? I thought you would have requested something more...combative.", Mirabelle said weakly."Well, technically yeah, they're usually a combo of brawn and cleverness but in this case I can settle for just the later. As long as we can play some games like the one last night.", Lyca said.Mirabelle gulped slightly at the one she meant. She really didn't like how vividly detailed the fighting was, "S-s-sure, that's fair. B-But let's play something we're both new to, that way we'll be on equal ground.""Heh, I like the way you think, unfamiliar territory is always full of potential. Very well then, let's shake on it.", Lyca said extending her hand.Mirabelle reluctantly shook Lyca's hand. Challenge accepted. Mirabelle stood holding her competitors hand repeating Caleb's words in her head, its a bonding experience, a bonding experience, a bunny experiment, a bombing asparagus, a bbrrregguh essprrrredf. Mirabelle suddenly felt very light headed and looked at her arm to find that skin had turned bright pink. She looked at Lyca who had a vacant expression and looked to be on the verge of collapse."H-hey, howsa long we bent in here?", Lyca slurred trying not to fall over." I...don't... know. But...we should... get out.", Mirabelle slurred."Good idea", Lyca said lumbering out of the tub towards the exit. Mirabelle did the same nearly tripping on her own towel.Back in the dining room, Caleb had finished setting up breakfast and was sitting at the table on his phone waiting for his homestays. He looked at the stack of pancakes, sausage and bacon, avocado toast, and home style grits. He then noticed he forgot orange juice and make his way back into the kitchen grabbing some cups from the cabinet and jug from the fridge."Man, where are those two?", he questioned pouring the juice thinking it was strange they'd be late for breakfast. Mirabelle especially since she can't seem to get enough of his pancakes and Lyca was at the table so fast last night he swore she teleported." Hello dear." "Hey Chief", two voice uttered coming down from the hallway to the entryway of between the kitchen and living room."Yeesh, where were you guys? The food was starting to get c-", he began until his eyes grew wide in shock and a blush spread across his face. The girls were standing there sloppily dressed with steam radiating from their bright pink faces. Lyca's jean shorts were unbuttoned leaving her black panties exposed. The straps on her tank top hung limply off her shoulders as the rest of the shirt allowed her braless chest to drift freely. Mirabelle attire was worse. The cloak for her bottom half left her back legs and rear without cover while the entire thing hung lazily to the floor at her front legs. Her lavender blouse was unevenly buttoned giving full view of her stomach as her breasts breasts casually poked through her violet silk bra. Both of them deliriously swayed and staggered like a couple of drunk sorority girls.Caleb covered his eyes trying to give them some privacy. Suddenly he felt a wetness on his upper lip, he wiped it away to see that it was blood. He had got a nosebleed. Seriously, is this anime cliché day or something?, he thought rolling his eyes."Soddy we're late dear. We were just had girl talk.", Mirabelle slurred straggling to keep focus."Goddamn, how long were guys in the tub? I can feel y'all body heat from here.", Caleb inquired setting the full glasses next to the jug then going to attend to his house guests."I don't know I lost track but it's good, we're all good now let's eat together chief.", Lyca muttered as she stumbled over towards him but tripped over herself. Luckily, Caleb managed to catch her then pick her up bridal style lying her on the couch. Suddenly he felt Mirabelle's slender arms drape around his neck and her hot breath hit his ear which somehow gave him a sudden chill down his spine. Well this is a familiar situation, he thought dryly."Everything smells delicious dear, you even made my favorite, blueberry pan...", she trailed off as Caleb could feel her collapsing on top of him; her weight pressing into his back. He turned around ducking under her grabbing her midsection to hold her up. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending how you look at it, her half exposed breasts were now pressing into Caleb's face. Mirabelle shifted with a light moan holding his head not fully aware of what she was doing. Caleb felt his heart quicken as the tender flesh glided against chest and chin. His brain went cloudy for a minute as his other brain downstairs demanded to take over, he gave himself a good harrrrrd mental slap to get his mind out of the gutter.ok, OK, OK, Ooook, stay calm. Come on you are not no teenager anymore. they are just boobs. Sweet round supple-NO no no no FOCUS goddammit gotta get these two cool. he thought struggling to keep his himself focused. He used the ottoman as support while he hoisted Mirabelle's upper body and front legs on the couch; lying her on her side and unwrapping her cloak around her legs. He then adjusted the other section of the couch and lifted up her back legs and...rear end. He threw a sheet over be rear to protect her sanctity. So glad she told him not covering the lower half constitutes nudity among centaurs."Good grief.", he muttered before going off to kitchen....a few minutes later..."Here you go guys, this should help", Caleb said walking back into the living room with two bottles of cold water. He unscrewed one of them and gently lifted up Mirabelle's head."OK, moon pie. Have a drink of this.", he said as she took plaintiff sips before growing into full gulps. When it seemed she could hold it herself, he got the other bottle and did the same procedure for lyca. As soon as she got a few sips, her eyes shot open, swiping the bottle away and guzzling down the refreshing liquid. The two liminals simultaneously let out rejuvenating gasps as Caleb took a couple blue plastic lids from two large bowls to fan them both." hahhhh that feels nice, thank you chief. ", Lyca said gratified at the gesture." Sigh yes thank you dear.", Mirabelle said contently before noticing where they were. She and Lyca were lying on the couch. She was outstretched on her side lying on the adjacent side of the couch from Lyca.," Wait, weren't we just going to the dining room? What we doing here? She questioned while Lyca looked around realizing she was correct."Well it appears a couple of bathing beauties were enjoying this house's personal hot spring a little too much.", Caleb said with a smirk still fanning them.Both looked at the man with an embarrassed blush thinking of what probably happened in their delirious state. He suddenly stopped fanning and stepped around the couch picking up a serving tray from the kitchen counter. He placed tray on the coffee table and knelt down pulling out two folding TV dinner tables from under the couch."Ok, now eat up you two. I'm sure you're both starving.", He said putting a plate of food on each folding tray table in front of each of them. Lyca's plate was full of sausage, bacon, and pancakes and Mirabelle's plate was mostly pancakes with a small side of grits and avocado toast. No soon as he gave Lyca her food her entire demeanor lit up as her tail wagged furiously and her tongue slightly hung out of her wide smile. Caleb then gave them each a tall glass of orange juice."Sure am, thanks a whole bunch chief!", she exclaimed before chomping down on the thick juicy meat (wow, that came out wrong)."Y-yes thank you Caleb... but are you sure it's acceptable to eat here?", Mirabelle asked as Lyca suddenly stopped eating looking up at him then noticing the bit of bacon on the couch cushion and discreetly sweeping them in her palm."Eh, don't worry about it, that's what Febreeze and a vacuum are for. You guys just relax I'll be in my office informing my bosses on my progress through video conference. It may last a couple hours but if you need anything just knock.", he said giving each of them a loving pet on the head, " oh and uh, you guys might want to make some...alterations to your attire."They both tilted their heads at him with their mouths full before looking at each other then down at themselves. Mirabelle was the first to realize by letting out a short yelp."EHHHH? O-oh my goodness, how embarrassing and I'm a grown woman.", she whined hugging her chest to cover the open areas and pulling her legs into her body." Ah man, knew I was feeling oddly unconstrained.", she with an annoyed grimace standing up shaking her hips to adjust her shorts, "hey chief could you help-"Caleb then cleared his throat, "Ahem welp, I'll give you guys your privacy. Imma be in my office, later", he said leaving quickly out of the room before Lyca could finish her statement. A door closing could be heard down the hall.As Mirabelle rebuttoned her shirt and realigned her bra, she gave Lyca a rather dry look. To which the young werewolf simply shrugged with a conceding grin.....An hour had passed and the girls finished breakfast and regained much of their senses, they finally began Lyca's challenge to determine the 'Alpha female'. They've decided to play a game they found hidden among Caleb's collection called 'Tekken 7'. After the opening cinematic finished playing with both liminals in different degrees of astonishment, they went through the process of navigating the menu, choosing controller settings, setting the number of rounds( they chose five per match), and selecting their characters. Mirabelle was at least pleased that the game wasn't as gory as the other fighting game.The first match was somewhat one-sided; Mirabelle as Kuma and Lyca as Paul Pheonix. Though the two were mainly just button mashing, Lyca came at Mirabelle with ruthless strikes putting the panicking centaur in the corner every time. Eventually it ending with Lyca winning 3 to nothing. Mirabelle was disheartened but remained steadfast in her goal.However, the following matches was where the momentum started to pick up exponentially. Each of the girls learning and memorizing each others attack patterns and tactically exploiting whatever openings they could find. Every second the television screen was lit ablaze with a flurry of special combos and finishing moves. Both girls hardly even blinking the flames of determination engulfing their pupils. They didn't want to miss a solitary second, neither wished to give their opponent opportunity to land another blow. Character after character each of them went through the roster going through match after match with a few ending in draws. Mirabelle was at least able to keep up with Lyca to the point that they were at a stalemate much to the latter's enjoyment and slight annoyance.A solid hour and a half passed and Caleb was just coming out of his office after another long design update with his bosses. He walked down to his bedroom stretching the stiffness out of his arms and back from sitting for so long. He took off his company uniform shirt that he wore only during video conferences to make it feel more like he's at their office and replaced it with the T-shirt from earlier. "Hoooookay, hope carbon fiber plating will make durable enough blades to withstand the changing wind gradients.", he said checking his phone to see it was noon. As if on cue his stomach gave a low animalistic growl; lunch time. I wonder how those two little dingalings are getting along, I bet they're hungry too. Wonder what they want to eat, he thought airily walking the hall to the living room." Hey guys", he said, "sorry that took so long, they pushed the deadline back to run further tests.""Uh-huh", they both said in unison furiously mashing the buttons on their controllers.Caleb stood behind the couch looking down at the two before looking at the TV screen. They were playing Tekken 7, a series he recently got back in to. He looked back down at the girls who wore some of the most intense expressions he had seen on anyone in awhile. Both of them had this aura around that could only be described as unrelenting determination. They were totally in the zone." OK, so you guys hun-", he started but then Mirabelle suddenly cut him off."Can't talk Caleb. Final match. Must beat Lyca.", Mirabelle uttered quickly still clearly focused. It looked like she was controlling Kazumi Mishimi." In your dreams Seabiscuit", Lyca practically growled continuing her button assault. She was controlling Katarina Alves.Caleb observed them play for a couple minutes. It looks this were in their third round; Lyca and Mirabelle each have a point on under thief health bars. He subconsciously gripped the cushion in anticipation as both their characters had a red glowing aura appear around them; they had entered rage mode. His eyes widened as they camera turned to slow motion as they just nearly landed a deciding blow three times in a row, both barely missing. After the fourth slowmo shot, they finally connected, ending the round in a double K.O. Lyca then let out an audible snarl as Mirabelle held her controller close with eyes narrowed on the screen. This round decides the winner.Deciding to let them finish up, Caleb went into the kitchen and began making them quick snacks. He diced a couple apples sprinkling some cinnamon sugar into lidded container and put a plate of Johnsonville meatballs in the microwave. He then went back into the living room lightly shaking the closed container of apple cinnamon mixture. He was greeted with the sight of Lyca standing up on the couch legs spread in a crouch position as she wore an annoyed scowl gritting her teeth and furiously mashing her controller. Mirabelle appeared focused but slightly unnerved evident by her slumped posture."That's what I'm talking bout! Woo, put them toes on ya girl", Lyca wooed finishing Katarinas rage art delivering a flurry of powerful kicks before sending Mirabelle flying to the corner with one last flying kick to the torso. Mirabelle's health was now in the the red."N-Not yet!", Mirabelle proclaimed as she parried Lyca's blows before doing a sweeping kick knocking her down then following up with a few sharp blows now putting Lyca in the red.Both girls eyes grew sharp with determination. The next hit will decide this challenge. They rushed each other exchanging hit in slow motion just barely missing each other. Lyca tried performing a rising kick but Mirabelle managed to back up in the knick of time.Seeing her chance Mirabelle sat up straight ears erect. "Now!", Mirabelle exclaimed as Kazumi executed her rage art sending a barrage of strikes at her opponent and finishing with a devastating powered up right hook sending her opponent flying. The screen showed an image a Kazumi doing her signature victory pose.Mirabelle eyes widened in surprise as smile grew on her face. Lyca's jaw dropped with her arms hanging limply the controller slipping out of her clawed fingers before plopping down on the couch in defeat. She then pushed the button sending the game back to the menu." Yay, I won, ow!", Mirabelle chirped happily clapping her fingers before wincing at the sharp pain in her hands."Heh, wow you guys really good at this game. But...how's about you guys chill for a bit? Carpal tunnel's no laughing matter.", he chuckled opening up the bowl of homemade apple bites placing them on the coffee table. Mirabelle thanked him massaging her hands as he did. He looked over at Lyca who slumped over staring at the ceiling looking kinda bummed out. He guessed she must have been on a losing streak. A loud dinging sound could be heard from the kitchen. "Oh, that's the meatballs be right back", he said walking off before being stopped by what happened next." Mirabelle! Chief!", Lyca exclaimed standing up to straight to attention getting Caleb and Mirabelle's attention ears pointed down, "I...accept my position in the pack. As the omega I follow you both and relinquish myself to you.""Um, L-Lyca you d-", Mirabelle started but interrupted."No. I lost and you fair and square. Plain and simple. So, you are the Alpha female.", she said with a clearly forced smile.Mirabelle and Caleb stared at each other questioningly then back to Lyca with worried expressions.Caleb was the first to say something, " Lyca what are you talking about? Relinquish yourself? What do you mean about being the omega?""Y- yeah, we're a small pack so their has to be an Alpha pair and one Omega. It's common for the weakest member of the pack to be subservient to superiors", Lyca explained point to herself, "Well now at least I know my place here. It's one I'm quite familiar with."Caleb stood in confusion for a second before remembering the what he read about werewolves and their hierarchy system."W-what do you mean to say?", Mirabelle asked a bit nervous she may strike a nerve." Yeah, why would you talk about yourself like that?", Caleb askedLyca looked up with despairing eyes, " In my old pack, I was always at the bottom. The others were always so much stronger, faster, and smarter than me. I couldn't keep up so I could never move beyond my position. They treated me like crap for it and I was always hungry from whatever scraps were left from a hunt. You can't do anything without their say so, I was like a living punching bag to them."Caleb and Mirabelle looked at her with utter shock at how her demeanor has taken a drastic change from earlier. The once chipper and energetic young wolf girl now looked like a wounded puppy. Caleb felt something in the pit of his stomach. Something he hadn't felt since...That day."When I heard about the exchange program, I saw my chance to get out of that. Maybe find myself a good enough human to be my Alpha male.", Lyca said with a light blush.Caleb blinked rapidly at that last comment processing what she said."Lyca, yesterday you told me it was part of werewolf tradition to share a mate, so no one is left out. Tell me, is that completely true?", Mirabelle asked standing up as Caleb raised an eyebrow looking at her questioningly before turning his attention back to Lyca.Lyca paused for a second before taking a seat fiddling her claw, " Well...it's what I think it should be. The truth is unless you prove yourself stronger, you'll never have any chance with the higher ups especially if you're an omega. I've known members who straight up abandoned their previous partner to be with one of higher rank."Mirabelle and Caleb listened with feelings of remorse for her as she pulled her knees into her looking at Caleb."I wanted to be apart of your pack but I knew I needed to prove myself worthy. I wanted at least a shot at being on top just once.", she then looked over at Mirabelle who slightly jumped in surprise, " Guess I was asking for too much. What kind of wolf am if I couldn't even win against you, horsey, someone so timid and frightful?"Caleb felt a tinge of annoyance from what her insult towards Mirabelle before letting it pass, for now. Mirabelle appeared to ignore it completely still worried about her."I know it's not my place to make requests but please...", Lyca whimpered before being interrupted." THAT'S ENOUGH.", he exclaimed loudly causing the two liminals to freeze solid in fear at the irate human. He just couldn't hold it in, her words, and feelings were all too familiar to him.Caleb then walked over to Lyca laying his palm on the top of her head. This caught her attention and she looked up at him in surprise expecting to be reprimanded. Mirabelle was also surprised by this looking at him intently."Lyca, I understand the feeling of needing to get out of a bad situation and being treated harshly by others around you, I really do. But you gotta understand, we are not a pack, that's not a thing in human society. You didn't have to earn our acceptance, you were welcome the second you walked through that door.", he said plainly." What? Then...what are we? Where do I even belong?", Lyca asked"We are a family, all of us, and in a family everyone is an equal. We take care of each other. You belong here Lyca, I'm y'alls host so it's my job to take care of you guys. Plain and simple." , He finished as he lightly pet her head.Lyca sat in a long pause for a minute letting what he said sink in."So no more talk about Alphas, Omegas, epsilon, betas, deltas whatever. You are Lyca Kessler and that's good enough for me. Besides, I really can't see myself as an Alpha anything. In this house, we operate in a democracy. Majority rule dictates everything baby.", He said reassuringly."But...she beat me...", Lyca started before she was quickly cut off."E-Even so you had a lot of fun, right? I certainly did, Halfway through I forgot we were having a serious match. You're quite the compelling and determined person Lyca just watching you motivated me as well.", Mirabelle finished feeling a bit more confident with a bashful smile. Caleb nodded at Mirabelle with a proud smile." This is you're home now Lyca. Don't every feel like you have to prove yourself to be here", Caleb finished with a gentle smile.Lyca looked back and forth between the two. Her tail wagging energetically and tears of joy forming in the corners of her eyes."Ohhh, come here guys let's bring it in, family hug time.", Caleb said leaning over the couch arms widely extended inviting them into his embrace. Both girls wrapped themselves around him enjoying their tender and sandwiching his face in between each of their cheeks. They stayed like that for a minute before Caleb decided to turn the mood around."So Lyca imma get your meatballs real quick, Mirabelle you should take care of the apples.", he said pointing to the open bowl of chopped up apples before going off to the kitchen.Lyca looked as he left with a small grin and light blush. She looked at Mirabelle who was blissfully enjoying the cinnamon apples." He's a keeper.", Lyca stated as Mirabelle stopped eating and looked at the werewolf next to her."Y-yeah.", Mirabelle said with a small smile" Look, hors- er, Mirabelle. I'm not too good with apologies, but I'm sorry for putting you through this.", Lyca said with her ears tucked toward in shame. Mirabelle surprised at first but decided to just accept it."It's fine, like I said, it was actually really fun.", she said with a smile before her face turned serious, "But I must know, What are your intentions with my Caleb?"Lyca sat crossing her legs into her body looking up at the ceiling pensively, "I don't know, I really like him. He's a great guy and I want to be with him but I know he doesn't see me that way. For now, I guess I'll back off and let you have him to yourself. But don't think I'm giving up on him, I've still got a few tricks."Mirabelle felt a combination of respect and worry bubble up inside her before saying, "Well, I'm glad you see that way but that doesn't mean I'll sit by and let you take him.""Heh, you know what, I like you Mirabelle. You may be shy but you got some spunk in you", Lyca said with a smile.The two shared a pleasant laugh together as Caleb walked with a bowl of meatball covered in a layer of barbecue sauce and a turkey club on a plate for himself." Haha what's so funny you two?", he said taking a seat on the couch in between them handing the bowl of meatballs to Lyca as he stomach growled then placing his sandwich on the table."Nothing dear just a little girl talk", Mirabelle said jokingly as he rolled his eyes.Suddenly they heard a short yelping sound like an injured puppy. They looked over at Lyca who having difficult time picking up the meatball. He heard her wince in pain again swearing under her breath." Need some help there Lyca", he asked"No no, it's good Chief, I j-fuck!", she swore as the meatball fellow through her aching claws on onto the floor.Caleb let out a sigh, " OK, give it here ", he said getting the bowl from much to her chagrin then picking up a meatball with a fork and offering it to her. She gave him a surprised as did Mirabelle."I told ya carpel tunnel don't play", he said as Lyca took the meatball in her mouth happily wiggling her body and wagging her tail." Thanks Chief, you're so sweet.", Lyca said as he continued to feed her. Mirabelle looked on with disbelief and jealousy before snapping out of it when Lyca gave her a wink while Caleb wasn't looking. Mirabelle gave her an angry moon pie pout."O-Ow", Mirabelle exclaimed getting Caleb's and Lyca's attention as she shakily picked up an apple with her fork only to drop it back to the bowl. She then gave Caleb a pleading expression melting her way into his heart. God, those soulful eyes." Moon pie, you need some help too? ", he asked plainly to which she meekly nodded. Lyca shot her a narrow eyed scowl to which Mirabelle gave her a somewhat devious smirk while Caleb wasn't looking.,...A couple minutes Caleb and the girls were sitting in the living room watching a movie on Netflix, Lego Movie, while toilsomely feeding his hosts with each hand. While the two seemed to enjoy the quality time, he couldn't help but frown sadly at his poor lonely sandwich and his empty stomach eager to have it take up residence. He looked between the two girls sitting closely to him as they seemed to be enjoying the movie.These girls needed him and in many ways he needed them. But then the starving jackal that was his stomach reminded him of how overly polite he was.Geez, the things I do for love, He thought mentally shrugging.Annnnnd done, hoowee. Yeah so, sorry for the late update, this was supposed to be up like two weeks ago. I've just been really occupied. My mom just got back from the hospital, they found some swelling in the glands in her neck that could be a growth but also found spots in her lungs. We have another appointment scheduled to see what that is to see if their connected and if they're not cancerous. Add that to one of my best friends getting killed in a fatal car accident and what do you get? Sadness, depression, and a realization of how fleeting life truly is. I ask for prayer her that's about all I can do now.So about lyca's past, I honestly didn't know what direction to go in. I had life three different ideas for her and I couldn't decide which one to settle on. After a little too much hieneken one night while working on it, I woke up next morning( with a wicked hangover of course) to find the 'Drunk me' had somehow combined all three ideas into one go. I cleaned up some spelling errors and baddabing new chapter.Now I'm not 100% sure about how this turned out and I may decide to rewrite Lyca's backstory because you guys deserve me at my best.So with all that in the open, I say thank you for reading. Make sure, to favorite, follow, and read. Peace Fam!
  
    Chapter Text
    Chapter 6: Red, White, and Moody Blues.Here I go again Fam! The next chapter of MonMusu x Alabama pride is up and ready for your viewing pleasure. Now with this chapter I was hoping to maybe have some fun. You know, to offset the drama in Caleb and the girls lives. This chapter is a holiday special (sorta) for the 4th of July. Let's just get right into it. Happy 'Merica Day."That's it Moon pie, you're doing great.", Caleb said exhaling lightly."Ahh, dear I don't think...ah...I can hold on much longer.", Mirabelle said" A-A little more, I'm so close, come on, baby", Caleb pleaded."*huff* OK, just please hurry and finish i-it's too- Mirabelle said"That's it, That's it, That's iiiiiit,""CALLLLEEEEB!""YES. Finally got it.", Caleb exclaimed in relief. That's the last of the buntings.Caleb signaled for Mirabelle to help loosen her grip as she stepped down off the step ladder. She heaved in exhaustion as she rubbed the stiffness out of her arms as Caleb wiped the sweat from his forehead.Lyca then walked in through the sliding backdoors running up meet Caleb, " Hey Chief, I just finished putting those bows on the fence and sticking all those little flags around the yard.", she said with a toothy grin."Haha thanks, Lyca.", He said patting her head inciting a content expression and energetic tail wag from her.Caleb then looked around the delightfully festive house with red, white, and blue nylon buntings and flag pennants lining the wall and Stars and Stripes sky-scapes lining the counter and edges of the front door which had a large American flag banner covering the center. The dining room table was decorated with patriotic bows behind each chair, flag tablecloth, and red, white, and blue plates. It's like Uncle Sam broke in and shat out an America fuck yeah in the house." hahh, Caleb dear, did we really have to hang them all?", Mirabelle slightly groaned her arms dangling to her side like limp noodles."Technically no, but it's an American Southern tradition to go overboard with holiday celebration and I thought you guys should enjoy the experience. Plus, they look pretty cool right?", Caleb chuckled and ceased petting Lyca as she leaned back against the couch contently.Mirabelle looked up around the house at the bunting symmetrically aligned around the house from the living room to the hallway entrance to the dining room." Well yes, I will admit the house does look quite lovely.", she said with a grin."Right? Thanks again you guys for helping out.", Caleb said walking over to the kitchen to fix the two liminals some well-earned peach lemonade." Of course, dear, happy to assist.", Mirabelle chirped happily."Yeah, chief. We got ya back, front, and sides.", Lyca chuckled relax in the chair down under one of vents feeling the AC.Caleb smiled walking over with two glasses in his hand. He gave one to Lyca who happily thanked him proceeded to drink it. He then moved over to Mirabelle who was looking outside at the backyard through the sliding at the beautifully decorated yard. The iron fence with the patriotic bows lining the entire area and mini flags sticking out of the ground. She turned to Caleb thanking him for the drink. Caleb looked down at his phone, 11:30 am, the barbecue started an hour ago. He should get them ready to go...after they all rest for a bit of course....1 week earlier...Caleb, Lyca, and Mirabelle had grown more accustomed to each other's company with the latter becoming a little less reserved around Lyca. However, the two still had their moments when their personalities didn't mesh well with each other. It turns out Lyca has a bit of a habit of invading personal space, not to intimidate but of playfulness, which did not help Mirabelle's anxiety towards contact with most people. A few times they'd have arguments on matters ranging from where to go for a cultural outing or just what movie to watch together. Luckily, Caleb was able to mediate many of these squabbles before things escalated any further through patience and understanding... and a small bribe or two. Eventually the two would always make up, both not wanting to upset their host or make him angry. That's one of a few things they agreed on.Caleb found that Lyca brought an extra...zest into his relatively quiet life with Mirabelle. Don't get him wrong there were times he felt overwhelmed and downright annoyed by the werewolf's incredible stamina and boundless jubilance but had grown to appreciate the energy she brought to the house. It's a good thing they lived close by the park so he could take her to get all that extra spunk out of her system. However, this didn't affect his time with Mirabelle much. They were still as close as could be and continued their DreamMasterz adventures. Of course, Lyca would still occasionally sneak into his bed for what she calls 'wolf den snuggles' much to Mirabelle's chagrin who would be doing the same.After a trip to the grocery store, Caleb found an opportunity teach them one of the cornerstone American celebrations in the form of a flyer hanging on the doors."I-Independence Day?", Mirabelle questioned tilting her then looking over at Lyca sitting next to her who simply shrugged in confused." Yep, it's coming up in a week and I think it's a good chance for you guys to learn a little about American history and holidays. Particularly, how folks in the South celebrate. ", Caleb said."OK, that sounds wonderful dear. What's the holiday about?", Mirabelle inquired clearly interested." Basically, it's celebrating the day a bunch of English colonists in powdered wigs won a war against their home country and establishing the new territory as an independent nation which is now the United States on July 4th, 1776. Ignoring the parts about the advent of African slavery and the dislocation and slaughter of the indigenous natives that were living here before colonization, it's an important stepping stone to the birth of Western civilization.",Caleb said plainly."Wait, what?!", both liminals exclaimed simultaneously with disbelief written on their faces." What?", Caleb asked"That's terrible! Why in the fuck would you guys celebrate something like that?!", Lyca exclaimed startling Mirabelle who admittedly agreed." Hey, I said it's a part of American history. Never said it was a pleasant one. The reason we celebrate it is the same for just about any holiday, to have an excuse to get off work, have fun with the people you care about, and eat delicious food. And maybe shoehorn in something about the holiday spirit mixed with some superficial message about togetherness.", Caleb finished with a light chuckle.Both liminals sat in befuddlement for a minute exchanging wide eyed glances before Mirabelle said, "Ok, T-Then how do we celebrate this...holiday?""Hmm, well we can decorate the house if we want, buy some fireworks, cook some food. Luckily for us though, we won't have to do too much since the park around here throws a huge 4th of July barbecue every year with lots of activities. So, I was thinking of taking you guys to that.", Caleb explained noticing their faces suddenly light up." Whoa a barbecue? I'm sold, is there going to be enough for everyone though?", Lyca asked"Heh, sweetheart you haven't seen Southerners during holidays like this. We don't cook, okay, we throw down. I hope your stomach can handle the load.", He replied with an almost maniacal grin which was greeted with Lyca's drooling wide mouthed smile." Hot damn, I'm gonna wolf down everything!", Lyca said ecstatically fist pumping."Yeah, and there's gonna be lots of games and afterwards a firework show. We may even be able to get some for ourselves.", Caleb" Fireworks? What are those? ", Mirabelle asked quizzically" Oh, just little containers that are ignited to create a beautiful explosion. Some of them shoot up into the air and blow up into these bright colorful sparkles and balls of light.", Caleb said putting extra emphasis on the last part."ooooooh, I seen those. I remember seeing something like that at night from atop the mountains where I grew up. They were so pretty and awesome.", Lyca exclaimed starry eyed." It does sound rather nice, but isn't it dangerous? No matter how you look they are still explosives?", Mirabelle stated."Don't worry, we have plenty of safety precautions and treatment methods in place for any accidents. I'll go over them with you guys later.", Caleb explained." O-Ok, then.", Mirabelle said still slightly uneasy about the idea."Ooh, ooh, ooh, what kind of games are we gonna play chief?", Lyca bounced energetically tail wagging happily in front of Caleb nearly making him lurch backwards." Let's see. There's a water balloon fight, a scavenger hunt, football tossing, and uhhh I think something called 'Flag tag'.", Caleb uttered thinking off the top of his head."that all sounds like fun. But, wait, what's the point of hunting prey that's already dead? Plus, rotten meat can make you really sick, trust me on that.", Lyca finished slightly cringing at what must have been an unpleasant memory.Mirabelle and Caleb gave her deadpan stares before Caleb spoke up, "Uhh, Lyca,...it's uh...not that kind of 'scavenger' hunt."Lyca held her head pensively for a second before her inner lightbulb went off, " Ohhhhhh, I get it. We hunt for the prey stored away for safe keeping by the enemy.", she emphasized pounding her fist to her palm challengingly. Mirabelle face palmed."OK, Lyca I'll explain how it works to you later.", Caleb said dryly"Um, dear what are we going to do about decorations? ", Mirabelle asked inquisitively" Way ahead of yeah Moon pie. I have everything we probably won't need. Turns out the last folks that rented this place were huge holiday nuts. They had huge supply of decorations for just about every one of them. When they moved away they left behind a some of their 4th of July decorations and never came back for them. Also, some Easter and Halloween stuff. I decided to put them all in storage. Hey, their loss is our gain right. ", Caleb finished with a shrug."Heh, that's quite convenient", Mirabelle giggled" Going to have call my landlord for the storage key. Then we can make this place look so patriotic the president will order for our home to be declared a national landmark.", Caleb laughed jokingly."Hell yeah, this gonna be the best first 4th of July ever!", Lyca exclaimed." Indeed, this will quite enjoyable ", Mirabelle said in cheerful tone....Back to the Present...Caleb and crew had left the house and were making their way to the park for the 4th of July barbecue. The weather was quite nice. A bit cloudy out so the Southern Summer heat wasn't much of a bother. When these rare occasions happen you best enjoy them. Caleb and Mirabelle walked shoulder to shoulder while the latter snaked her arm to his pulling him closer enough to lean slightly against him. He could feel her shaking as her anxiety started to sink in to which he lightly held her hand to reassure her safety. Lyca simply marched ahead of them like a soldier. She enjoyed pretending to lead them to places, it made her feel more in charge. She was singing a song she heard on a video Caleb showed her called ' I'm still standing'.As they got closer to the park they noticed the number of people around them was steadily increasing. Many of them were either just individuals passing through out of curiosity or families from around town looking to enjoy the festivities. There were quite a few host families and their liminal guests all heading toward the park, some walking in pairs. Caleb's crew reached the park gates and could hear the sound of music playing through loud speakers from the DJ stand playing 'HandClap' and people around them talking. A few people and liminals could be seen dancing around the DJ. The sight of humans and various liminals at the game booths and enjoying tasty snacks at the confessions. An ice cream stand operated by two female holstaurs sat near the entrance with a small crowd in front of it; mostly men. They saw a man win a large stuffed red, white, and blue bear for the short purple devil girl next to him. The scent of hickory smoke permeated the atmosphere and only gotten stronger closer the got.They approached a table with three women—two humans, one monoeye—sitting under a red canopy shade with a group of people around them. They were handing out forms to people and a red, white, and blue striped top when then finished. Caleb noticed an opening and as he approached the table, he was greeted by the human woman in the American dad shirt."Good afternoon sir, are you here alone?", she asked with a smile."No, I'm here with my two houseguests.", Caleb said as Mirabelle and Lyca seemed to materialize on either side of him. Mirabelle still remaining close to him cautiously observing others around them and Lyca ecstatically sniffing around."Fantastic. You're a part of the cultural exchange so you would fill out this form. Will you and your guest be participating in any of the events?", she said handing Caleb the for that listed all the events and their time stamps.Caleb and the girls looked at it then Lyca suddenly yelled, "Oh, WATER BALLOON DODGEBALL. LET'S DO WATER BALLOON DODGEBALL.""Ok, ok, we'll do it no need for the yelling.", Caleb said massaging his aching eardrum with his pinky. Lyca wiggled her body and wagged her tail as she happily cheered to herself. Caleb giggled at her then turned to Mirabelle."So, Moon pie, what would you like to do together?", He asked with a grin."I honestly don't feel like getting wet so water balloons are out. Hmmm, oh this looks like it would be fun", Mirabelle chirped pointing at the time stamp labeled 'Patriotic badminton', "Is that ok with you dear?""Sure, it'll be fun.", Caleb said filling out the form then handing it to the woman at the table."Thank you, sir. You all enjoy yourselves now.", The woman said handing them each a hat and giving Caleb a schedule. They put on their hats lightly giggling at each other as they made their way down the gravel walkway into the center of the park. They looked around at all the booths surrounding much of the park in a red, white, and blue sequence. Caleb then took out his phone put it on a selfie stick and called the two liminals together for a commemorative photo."Ok girls, it looks we got one hour to kill before both your activities begin, what should we do in the meantime?", Caleb said folding up the schedule then putting it away."Oh, that over there looks fun what's it called?", Lyca said pointing to the blue booth with the glass bottles on a large wooden table and a cluster of stuffed toys hanging at the top." That's called a ring toss. The guy gives you these metal rings and you try to get as many of them on a single bottle. The more you get on one bottle the better the prize.", Caleb explained."We're going.", Mirabelle stated almost authoritativelyCaleb and Lyca gave her questioned looks at her sudden change in character." Um, you okay Moon-hahh", Caleb yelped as he was suddenly dragged along toward the booth by the uncommonly forceful Nightmare with Lyca closely but warily following behind."You are mine. You are mine.", Mirabelle kept repeating as Caleb noticed her eyes had become a sharp and focused like a hawk staring daggers at something. At first, he was confused at her behavior until he finally understood what she was focused on. Among the cluster of stuffed toys was a child sized plushie of Sailor Moon. When they arrived at the booth, Mirabelle released his hand then turned to him with the pleading eyes of a child begging their parents for a new toy and then pointed up towards the Sailor Moon plushie. Caleb rolled his eyes and gave her thumbs up to which she clasped his hands together with starry eyes. Lyca was too busy admiring the plushies to notice them until she spied one she wanted. A black dog-like thing with white mask with red markings on it, hanging next to it was a girl in a red hood caring a large scythe." Good day sir, how many rings to get the Sailor moon.", Caleb asked the bearded man in the uncle Sam overalls and plain white T-shirt."4 rings on one bottle. It's $10 for five rings.", beard man explained." Okay, then. Five ring-", Caleb was suddenly interrupted when Lyca grabbed his arm pointing up at the black dog creature."Chief, can have him, please, please, it's so cool.", Lyca pleaded as Mirabelle shot her a 'you better not screw this up for me' glare." It's, uh, 3 rings.", bearded man chuckled."OK, 10 rings thank you.", Caleb said handing the man a 20. He then gave Caleb 10 red and white striped metal rings.Caleb took one of the rings focusing his vision on a single bottle. Luckily, he's played this game before as a kid and was good at it. After calculating the physics in his giving account to distance, force of gravity acting rings along putting a little spin allowing for the centripetal force to latch onto the bottle tip. He released the ring with the precision and ferocity of a ninja locking onto a target. As they looked on as the metallic ring soared through the air, it majestically twirled around as it locked on to its target. Then like the ping of the bells of Notre Dame it made a loud bong as it bounced off the bottle landing to ground on the other side of the booth. They all looked on with a deadpan expression." um, ahem, just a warm up, now it's about to get real up in here.", Caleb said confidently as Mirabelle and Lyca exchanged worried glances....30 minutes later..."Yay, thanks Chief you're the best. Who knew you were so tenacious.", Lyca happily giggled tossing and catching her black dog plush up." Thank you so much dear. You are truly a wonderful person.", Mirabelle mewled hugging her Sailor Moon plush in one arm and Caleb in her other nuzzling the crook of his neck."Please don't patronize me" Caleb muttered holding his head low in complete disbelief and shame. Though he eventually won them, he spent $60 winning them their plushies. What the hell came over him?Mirabelle then placed a kiss to his cheek snapping him out of his self-loathing thoughts and a grin came to his face. Guess it wasn't a completely hollow victory."Caleb? Boo, wassup?", an unknown voice called out getting the group's attention. Caleb stopped suddenly, he knew that voice. They all turned around both liminals releasing their host to see a slightly pudgy light brown-skinned woman of average height probably in her late twenties walking up to the group with a wide mouthed smile and arm outstretched waving at them. She wore white shirt with a picture of an eagle hold arrows in its claws and the words '2nd Amendment' above, cutoff blue jeans, and blue flat lace-up shoes. She wore purple framed glasses and had her black hair in a curly bun style." Vanessa! ", Caleb's eyes lit up as she ran up to Caleb pulling him in a tight hug giggling happily as he did the same. Both liminals froze in surprise and eyed the strange woman hugging their human cautiously. Mirabelle froze up horror and Lyca's ears stood erect as she emitted a low growl.*Narrator Sidelight*For those readers who are confused, this woman is Vanessa Bizzell. She and Caleb grew up together and were about a close as they could get. After his parents died followed by the falling out amongst his siblings, she and her father, Caleb's uncle, allowed him to stay with them after he lost the family home to the bank from an unpaid mortgage. They were the only real family he had left who actually cared for him.*Sidelight Over*Caleb suddenly released his embrace to look at the woman then said, " Hahahaha, damn. How you been? I haven't seen you since my graduation. ""Hahaha, yeah I know cuz, I'm sorry I was just real busy. I just finished my first year over in Ohio state. I came down to see how daddy doing.", Vanessa explained happily her gaze suddenly fixating on the two liminals eyeing her suspiciously, "Oh now, who we got here? Some friends of yours?"Caleb looked back at Lyca and Mirabelle and mentally facepalmed himself for ignoring them. He moved over between the ladies."Oh, right, sorry. Lyca. Mirabelle. This is my cousin Vanessa, she my Uncle Andrew's daughter. Cousin Vanessa, these are homestays for the Extra species exchange program.", Caleb gestured between them introducing everyone."Hey, nice to meet y'all.", Vanessa greeted the two liminals. Mirabelle simply greeted her nodding nervously. Lyca circled the woman sniffing at her curiously much to the latter's confusion before stopping in front her and nodding approvingly."You kinda smell like Chief, I like you already.", Lyca chirped happily as Vanessa turned raising an eyebrow to Caleb who simple shrugged with a nervous smirk." Wow, cuzzo, when pop said you joined that exchange program I almost didn't believe it. Clamming Caleb allowing strangers to live in his home. I thought judgment day had begun.", Vanessa said with a haughty smirk. To which Caleb let out an annoyed groan at her nickname for him."C-Clamming Caleb?", Mirabelle questioned attracting the rests attention. Caleb tried to wave her off from hearing the answer but Vanessa wouldn't have it." It's what we called him growing up. He only spoke around people he knew very well, everyone else he'd just clam up on quick. He couldn't even order his own food at restaurants", She chuckled. Lyca slightly giggled as well. Mirabelle simply gave Caleb a surprised glance. The thought of him being that shy was unbelievable."It ain't like that anymore. Everyone has the right to change themselves and I'm no different.", Caleb growled barring his teeth as she finished chuckling."Haha, yeah, OK cuz I guess you right. Hey, why don't we all go eat together for a bit. I think daddy over in the shade smacking on some ribs. That man can't get enough of dem baby back. ",Vanessa chuckled motioning them in the direction of the large birch trees close by with several picnic tables around them.Caleb looked over to the girls, "fine with me. What do say guys?""Y-Yes, that sounds fine.", Mirabelle said." Heck, yeah take me to the meat Chief's cousin.", Lyca stated marching along beside Vanessa. The latter shook her head at the endearing dog-girl.They found their way to the grilling area near the birch trees where two grill stations were sought up alongside tables with mountains of dishes lined up. There were bowls and aluminum trays with mac & cheese, salad, mashed potatoes, devilled eggs, yams, collard greens, steak, string beans, hamburgers, ribs, Chicken Tetrazzini, and corn bread. There were also pitchers of iced tea and Kool-aid for everyone to enjoy. Several people stood in lines with plates getting their fills."Oh there he is. HEY DADDY, I FOUND CALEB.", Vanessa shouted going over her father and Caleb's uncle who was sitting at the wooden bench looking up from the rib in his hands. He placed the bone among the others on his plate and wiped his hands with napkins. He got up with a huge grin on his face as he saw his daughter and nephew.He was fairly tall dark-skinned man in his late 50s with a hefty build and blackish-grey hair that was noticeably receding. He wore a short sleeve blue oxford shirt, blue jeans with patriotic suspenders connected to them and brown Nike sneakers. He also had a chrome-plated knob handle blue walking cane by his side. Not that he needed it much, he mostly had it because he thought he looked pimpin'." OH, Hahahaaaa hey nephew, glad to see I didn't need to drag you out of the house this year.", Andrew walking over to Caleb getting his arm around his shoulder as Caleb did the same. The both shared a loving chuckle."Yep, guess not. Glad to see you still ignoring doctor's orders.", Caleb said pointing to the pile of rib bones that had been picked clean." Ahh now don't you start. I get enough of that from Dr. O'Neal over here", Andrew scoffed gesturing to Vanessa who simply crossed her arms preparing to reprimand."That's because you don't know the meaning of self-control. You need to watch your blood pressure daddy.', Vanessa wined." Yeah, OK baby.", Andrew conceded not wanting to have that argument again, in public no less. He then looked over at Mirabelle who smiled shyly at him. They had met once before when he came over to Caleb's house one Sunday to drag him out for church. Ever since, Mirabelle seemed to get used to seeing him every once in a while, and it helped that Caleb really loved him too, it was easier for her to be open around him. Plus, she reminded Andrew of Caleb when he was younger."Hey, now, Mirabelle. How you been sweetheart? You been keeping this boy here in line?", Andrew said pointing a thumb to Caleb who grimaced at him from behindMirabelle giggled as she shook the older man's hand. She played along, "I'm fine, Mr. Bizzell. As usual Caleb is no trouble.".The old man gave a hearty approving laugh then he noticed Lyca sitting at the table with her own plate of ribs and steak tearing at the meat viciously, " Now who is this pretty little puppy?'Lyca stopped eating for a second, stood up, sniffed him a bit, and smiled at the man; little bit of meat stuck in her teeth, "Hi, my name's Lyca Kessler. Nice to meet you, Chief's uncle", she said shaking the man's hand proudly." Nephew, now you didn't tell me you got yourself another girl living with you. Strong little lady too.", Andrew chuckled as Lyca raised an eyebrow Caleb while stuffing a chunk of steak in her mouth."Yeah, I've been a lot more busy than usual, it kinda slipped my mind.", Caleb said plainly rubbing the back of his head embarrassed.After a getting themselves some of the food they sat at large picnic table-well, Mirabelle simply stood at the side of the table- eating and talking amongst each other. Vanessa told a few stories about Caleb when they are growing up, much to Caleb's embarrassment and annoyance. Though they did incite amusing laughter from Lyca and Mirabelle tried to hold hers in but soon lost it when Vanessa told the one about Caleb's first time at the dentist. Caleb simply shrugged off most of the laughter at his expense. He was just happy to see everyone he cared about getting along happily. Deep down he knew he really needed this.Vanessa looked between Caleb and his homestays before saying, " So, Caleb. Which one is your girlfriend? "Caleb coughed erratically in his napkin choking on his food as Mirabelle froze mouth agape in shock blushing madly letting her fork of Mac & cheese slip out of her stiff fingers. Lyca simply perked up her ears to attention with a light blush and a bone held her mouth. Both girls gave Caleb inquiring and somewhat hopeful glances as Vanessa and Andrew lean closer with almost sadistic smirks on their faces. Like father like daughter. Caleb sat there uncertain of what to say and a bit livid for being put on the spot. He took a deep breath then exhaled."What are you two talking about? You know it's against the law for a host to have romantic relations with their house guests.", Caleb stated then drinking some of his iced tea. That didn't seem to satisfy his cousin and uncle nor the two liminals. Both Mirabelle and Lyca wore slightly disappointed expressions." Shame, damn shame. Them damn Republicans in Congress need to get rid of that dam law.", Andrew shook his head mixing his collard greens with a fork as Vanessa nodded in agreement with him."Yeah, but that's how it is right now. We can only hope things will change.", Caleb said" That's right, and with all them protests I seen on TV that shouldn't be too long. Then you Mirabelle here can finally get together, eheheh.", Andrew finished with a chuckle as Mirabelle and Caleb suddenly tensed up. Mirabelle looked at Caleb with hopeful eye but flinched slightly and went to stuffing her mouth when they made eye contact. Lyca gave an annoyed pout."Now hold up daddy, why you trying to decide who he should go with. For all you know, he might choose Lyca.", Vanessa protested pointing at Lyca who gave her a surprised whimper. Caleb felt time stop as his eyes met Lyca's. She gave him a supporting grin showing a single white fang and blinked rapidly before looking away unsure of himself. Mirabelle noticed their exchange and gave a saddened pout before resuming finishing the Mac&Cheese.A loud voice booming male voice from the speakers near the DJ could be heard throughout most of the park, "ATTENTION. FOR ALL THOSE PARTICIPATING IN THE 4TH OF JULY ACTIVITIES, PLEASE REPORT TO OUR DESIGNATED AREAS."Oh the lord have mercy Jesus, Caleb thought as he quietly exhaled to himself before standing up catching their attention and throwing his ladies"Alright, ladies. Time to enjoy some good old fashion American fun", Caleb stated rubbing his hands together hoping to take minds off the subject."Oh, you guys are gonna play some of the games?", Vanessa said with clear interest." Yep, wanted to give the girls the full experience of how we celebrate in the South.", Caleb said with a content chuckle as he looked at the schedule of events then at his phone, "Oh, we should get goin', Lyca's event starts in ten minutes."As Caleb said this Lyca quickly finished the rest of her food with an audible gulp before throwing away her plate. Mirabelle placed a large napkin over her food before excusing herself and throwing her plate away. Lyca rushed to Caleb's side bouncing and pulling on his arm ready to go."Come on Chief, we don't want to be late.", Lyca stated."Hey, Hey, nephew y'all stayin' for the firework show? Heard George Earl got some of them Roman candles you like.", Andrew said standing up grabbing his cane. His daughter wiped her mouth and started wrapping her remaining food in aluminum foil." Awesome, ugh, yeah...we were planning ugh...on staying to see 'em. Ow, Come on, take it easy Lyca.", Caleb uttered while the impatient werewolf tugged him away towards. Mirabelle stood beside them observing them passively."Alright, now we'll see y'all later. Pleasure meeting ya ma'am.", Andrew said and Lyca stopped pulling on Caleb. To which the latter took the opportunity to massage the soreness away." Yeah, likewise. You're a really cool guy, I can see where Caleb gets his charisma.", Lyca complimented beaming a toothy grin at him. To which, a boastful smile became plastered on his face. L"Honey, don't feed his ego. Imma be hearin' his mouth runnin' all day", Vanessa remarked as Lyca Andrew ignored her and focused on Mirabelle." Ey now, Mirabelle you keep looking out for my favorite nephew, ya hear?", Andrew said giving her thumbs up.Mirabelle gave him a candid smile, "O-Of course Mr. Bizzell."Lyca then took Caleb's hand and resumed pulling him to where the games are with Mirabelle quickly galloping off behind them.Vanessa and Andrew watched as they left both in quiet contemplation. "Heh, I haven't seen Caleb that lively in real long time.""I'm telliin ya. Them girls have really put a pep in his step. I'm thinking about becoming a host myself.", Andrew chuckled warranting a surprised look from Vanessa." What would your homestay even be? Oh I know! An orc.", she finished with a laugh."You can't let me have anything can you?", Andrew sulked" Ah, quit yo groanin and let's get some of that Holstaur ice cream I heard about", Vanessa stated....The rest of time Caleb and the girls were at the park was very enjoyable. Lyca and Caleb were quite the pair during the water balloon dodgeball challenge as Mirabelle simply observed them on the sidelines but somewhere with fewer people around her. There were a few liminals with their hosts and everyone was paired in teams of two, 11 teams total. They played in an open grassy space in the park using red, white, and blue balloon. The rules were essentially if you or your partner got hit three times, your team is out. Throughout the match Caleb was amazed by Lyca's incredible speed, especially on all fours. Her agility made it extremely difficult for anyone to hit her. She and Caleb came up with the strategy of him baiting their target while she took them out. It worked for a while, they even took out four teams; that is until they were facing a harpy and her male host. The two used a ground to air tactic that ended up overwhelming Caleb and Lyca. Their 'battle' ended when Caleb was caught off guard and the harpy dropped multiple water balloons from above like a bomber plane. However, Lyca pushed Caleb out of the way in the nick of time taking the full brunt of the attack. They may have lost the game, much to Lyca's dismay, he quickly gave her a reassuring petting session and it was all good. Exhausted, she decided to take a nap under a shady tree.Next, was the Patriotic badminton competition hosted at what was usually the public tennis court. After a quick demonstration, be one of the park staff, Mirabelle remarked on how the game was like one she played with members of her clan growing up. She immediately boasted on how she was the best among the clan at it. Caleb simply regaled her of his own skill at the game growing up before they were both chastised by the park staff lady for disrupting the group. There were close to 20 participants some of which were liminals, of course. The game was players as mixed double with two players on each side with teams of one man and one woman. In the first, game between a guy and a female ogre, Mirabelle felt really intimidated by the violent looking which through off he concentration. What's more, she and Caleb were having a bit of trouble adapting to each other's play style. However, with a boost of encouragement by Caleb, Mirabelle could get into the swing of things, literally. They ended up winning the first round by several outs by the ogress, lucky them. The preceding matches saw a noticeable change in the pair's dynamic as they developed a nearly flawless rhythm. The two kept freely alternating between offensive and defensive positions to make it harder for their opponents to predict their strikes. They eventually made it to the final round against a human teenage girl and a male Elf, who almost looked like Legolas in a white polo shirt and capris. The tactic they used up to then proved to be not enough to deal with the Elfman and girl's coordinated strikes at Mirabelle's blind spots. However, Caleb managed to read the patterns of their strikes and noticed two openings they made whenever one struck the shuttlecock. He and Mirabelle came up with a fake out tactic that greatly exploited it and they ended up winning the competition barely by one point. They won first prize: $500 cash and a $100 gift card to Kami House. Mirabelle was so ecstatic she Caleb in a backbreaking hug.Five hours had passed.It was getting dark out with only the park's lamp posts and game booths illuminating the area. Caleb and the girls had set up a space on a small hill to watch the fireworks show. They met up again with Caleb's uncle and cousin. Vanessa and Lyca hit it off more. Vanessa brought a frisbee and they spent much of the time tossing it around, even attracting others into playing with them. Andrew met up with a few buddies down at the car manufacturing plant he used to work at and decided to play a few rounds of dominoes; leaving Caleb and Mirabelle alone.The two sat at the top of the hill among a few other people on a blanket that was provided to them. The fireworks show was about to start as Caleb looked around at people still enjoying the many brightly colored game booths and dancing around the DJ then to the pitch-black night sky with the faint glow of stars.He then looked at the beautiful centaur sitting next to him in her dark purple gown-like skirt and orange Overwatch tracer T-shirt with black choker on her neck. She was happily clutching the Sailor moon toy like a security blanket."So, sweety, you are enjoying yourself so far?", Caleb asked her as she snapped herself back to reality then beaming the young man a genuine smile." Oh yes my dear, I haven't had this much fun in long time.", Mirabelle said as her ears twitched happily."Yeah, that makes two of us then.", Caleb said slightly remissive." I-Is something wrong?", Mirabelle inquired concerned she may have upset him somehow."No, no I'm just surprised... at myself.", Caleb said looking toward the sky in deep thought." How do you mean?", Mirabelle asked staring at him and scooting herself closer."I haven't been out to anything like this in long time. I just couldn't. They always bring up too many memories of my parent, brother, and sister. How much fun we used to have. Those days are gone now.", Caleb spoke dejectedly remembering that awful day and blinking away tears that welled up. He then felt a slender arm snake under his arm softly intertwining each other."C-Caleb?", Mirabelle spoke softly her violet sparkling eyes peering into his with great concern. He then shook his head which caught her surprise." B-But today, I didn't feel that way. I had so much fun with you and Lyca. I'm thankful to have you, both of you, in my life.", Caleb ruminated leaning back slightly supporting himself with his free hand. Mirabelle's eyes widened before a small smile appeared on her face, "Uh, sorry if I'm being overly sentimental.""No, dear. I'm always happy to see that beautiful soul of yours.", Mirabelle stated resting her head to his shoulder catching his attention. He was about to say something but he was quickly interrupted by the loud bangs and whizzing of fireworks being shot off. They both looked up with different degrees of amazement as the night sky was illuminated with rainbow of flames dancing across the sky. Clusters of strobing yellow and red sparks and bright blue balls that exploded into parasol-shaped light. Mirabelle pointed in child-like amused at the purple spiraling sparkles that gave the illusion of a mini Galaxy sitting just above them. A large pattern of multicolored hearts appeared above them with audible bangs.As they observed the wondrous display, Mirabelle noticed Caleb's delighted face and felt her entire body become light as dust from content. She then reached hand to Caleb's clasping it softly and getting his attention momentarily. Their eyes met as the flashing rainbow of light behind them illuminated both of their faces. The smiled at each other taking in the moment.Just for a moment, I want to forget everything, Caleb thought taking in the sight of the beaut-no, gorgeous woman beside him. The vivid color of lights reflecting off of Mirabelle entire body only reminded Caleb of how radiant she was. A rare breed, literally and metaphorically, everything about her was amazing. Her personality, her interests, her appearance, her voice, her eyes-dear god those eyes. Honestly, she was way too good for someone as plain and unremarkable as him. He was brought out of his thoughts when she suddenly cupped his cheek pressing her large breasts to his shoulder."Caleb...I...", Mirabelle whispered parting her lips as her face inched closer. Unsure of what to do to neutralize this, Caleb did the only thing possible-give in to the situation.He leaned in too moving their clasped hands to her chest where Caleb could feel her heart pounding. As was his. They both puckered their lips, ready to embrace each other for the first time in the real world." Hey guys! Want some mini-sundea?", Lyca shouted from behind causing the two to shriek in confusion and fright quickly pulling from each other. Caleb nearly did a somersault backwards down the small hill before catching onto the blanket Mirabelle was still sitting on and stabling himself."Oh, sorry bout that Chief. I just wanted you guys to try these Holstaur ice cream sundaes before they ran out", Lyca said handing a chocolate tipped sundae in a small plastic cup to Mirabelle. Whom reluctantly took the cup looking down at it dolefully before taking off the plastic spoon from the bottom." Sshhhooo-K. Thank you Lyca and please stop doing that. Nothing wrong with just a shoulder t-W-wait did you say sundaes? You didn't eat any with chocolate or fudge, did you?! You know they make canine liminals sick.", Caleb inclined placing the sundae on the blanket and inspecting Lyca's face for paleness. Mirabelle gave a startled expression as she saw this nearly dropping her cup."Relax Chief, I only had mine with peanut butter. I still feel fine.", Lyca said before three parasol sprays of light above them caught her attention inciting a delighted expression from her, " Whooooaaaaa. Their WAY more amazing up close." Lyca then lied down on the grass next to Mirabelle with her eyes fixated on the exploding stars above them."Lyca, *huff* you remember I was following you right?", Vanessa said hunched over catching her breath, " *huff* Damn, girl you are fast.""Looks like someone shouldn't have skipped leg day.", Caleb hummed as she motioned towards him to hit his shoulder, which he effortlessly dodged." Gah, whatever. You know where daddy gone at?", Vanessa inquired."Over there playing dominoes.", Caleb said pointing to the well-lit area with large folding tables. Uncle Andrew sat among 6 other men with a couple of them smoking laughing." Figures. ", Vanessa smiled them looked up at the light spectacle above them and sitting down in the grass." Yep.", Caleb stated.They all sat together the rest of the time watching the fireworks and making idle chitchat. All the while, Mirabelle glanced at Caleb intently simultaneously glad to see him at ease yet remiss about losing their alone time.Soon the group decided to pack things up and go home for the night. Caleb and the girls said bye to Vanessa and Uncle Andrew promising to go out again as a group. They made their way through the park gates among the other people either walking home or taking the trolley. Caleb's house was only a couple minutes away so taking the trolley would have been pointless. Suddenly they were stopped by a sudden shriek. Caleb whipped his head around to see Mirabelle frantically searching through her bag and pockets."Oh Noooo, I think I left my Sailor Moon back at rest area!", Mirabelle shrieked clutching her cheeks in horror slightly teary eyed. Lyca felt bad for her until she felt the side of denim shorts noticing the absence of a demonic wolf toy hanging from it. Her eyes widened in shock."Crap! Bain isn't here, I might have left him there too!", Lyca exclaimed now also her cheeks in horror. Of course, she named it Bain, Caleb thought."It's not too far from the entrance and he park doesn't close until 10. We got an extra 20 minutes let's go them.", Caleb said making his way back to the front gate with both Liminals passing by him quickly causing him to spin a little."Thank you dear, but we can get them. You just stay out front and make sure they don't lock us in.", Mirabelle said"Yeah, we'll be right back. Come on Mira, let's go.", Lyca assured him before pulling Mirabelle's arm warranting a yelp from the startled centaur. They were gone and Caleb simply stood by the gate looking at his reading over emails and texts from work. Almost everyone had gone home leaving him virtually alone save for a few people still walking out of the park.As Caleb pondered wondering why it took ten minutes to get their toys and come back, suddenly heard a loud noise as if something metallic had been knocked over. He searched for the source noticing now a rustling sound and plastic rattling. He found the source. It came from in between it from an alleyway in between a closed apparel shop and an old boarded up halfway house set to be knocked down. A shadowy form could be seen coming around the corner. Was it a raccoon? Or a dog going through some trash? No, it was much larger and it had human form. It limped around out in the open before falling over onto the ground.Caleb checked both ways before quickly dashing across the street to check on the person. When he reached it, he got a good look from the light of a lamp post to and was surprised by what he saw. It was woman. Not only that, but she had dark blue horns on her head, black bat-like wings, a slender whip-like black tail with little shades of blue at the tip which ending in a spade. She had caramel brown skin and pointed ears with gold pin earring. She was a Devil. She looked as if she had been in a fight. Her light blue lace panel shirt had been ripped at the shoulder. The black skirt she wore was torn as were her black stockings. She was also barefoot, her dainty toe expose at the torn off section of the stock. He looked closer in shock to see she had a deep slash wound across her knee which was bleeding out steadily and one of her wings had wicked slash mark splitting the wing and it bled."Oh my God, who did this to you? Hang on, i'll get you to a-", Caleb said reaching down to help her up only for her to smack his hand away glaring at him with her red eyes with black sclera. She bared her teeth at him scooting away from him leaving a small trail of blood."Stay...away...from me...filthy human.", she hissed in a noticeable hispanic accent holding her arm; which Caleb just noticed was also bleeding. There was a hole in the sleeve of her shirt. Was she...shot?She glared at Caleb intently watch his every move."Look, it's alright. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm going to call an ambulance and we'll get you some help ok.", Caleb said calmly taking out his phone and dialing 9-1-1. He noticed her demeanor soften slightly."Hello, 911? I have an emergency. A young woman, of the Devil species, she's been badly injur-",Caleb said before the Devil suddenly yelled in panic with eyes wide in panic. Caleb then felt sharp pain in the back of his head as he fell to the ground. He had been knock out; his assailant, a man dressed in all black carrying a crowbar. Caleb's world was spinning his vision was blurry and his hearing was disjointed. All he could make two pairs of legs and the devil lady thrashing about before suddenly going limp. They through her in the back of a van then turned to Caleb. He felt one hoist up his legs and the other get his shoulders and placed in the van. Caleb was still conscious enough to make out one of the men look over him curling his fist. The last Caleb was a sudden pain in his face...then nothing. He was out cold.As the van sped away, a few seconds later Mirabelle and Lyca came out of the park to find their host is nowhere to be seen." Caleb? CALEB? We're back, let's go home!", Mirabelle called out only to be met with silence, "CALEB?", she called out again still no response. She gave Lyca a questioning look but she was just as confused as her."Perhaps he went back to look for us? I think we can try looking before it closes", Mirabelle said turning around to head back in the park." Wait. *sniff sniff* He's still here, I know his scent anywhere.", Lyca announced as Mirabelle stopped and turned around. Lyca then went off sniffing out his scent while Mirabelle followed behind her.They came across the area Caleb was abducted as Lyca stood there taking a big wiff, "Here, this is where his scent is strongest. It's coming from...that.", she said pointing to Caleb's cellphone. She then tensed up trembling from fear, " I...There's also...the scent of blood. His blood"Mirabelle felt her own blood run cold as she picked up the phone with trembling hand and noticed the tiny pool of blood underneath. She gulped staring at it in horror. Then she saw the streaks of blood near the street corner. It was like something out of a serial killer horror film. She felt nauseous as Lyca looked at her in worry and fear. Mirabelle collapsed on her knees clutching the phone to her chest and Lyca went to her side trying to comfort her."Caleb….where's…WHERE"S MY CALEB?!", Mirabelle stated as Lyca shuddered unsure of what to do or say.They knew one thing at than. Caleb was gone.DONE AND DONE. Well this one was quite the task. Not only was I working crazy shifts but I also took learning the German language, I had to designate 1 hour a day writing this. I want to visit Germany someday, so I said "Why not learn the language?". Hope you liked this chapter a bunch of stuff happened, so much I'm sure I forgot some of it. Tell ya the truth this wasn't supposed to be so long, but I guess I went a little overboard again. Also, in case you didn't get it Lyca's is based off of the movie 'American Werewolf in London'. Mirabelle's from somewhere in Europe so I wanted to go for that dynamic. Now stay tuned for the next chapter. Will Caleb and Mirabelle truly express their feelings for each other? Who was the devil lady? What did those men want with her? Why did they kidnap Caleb? And most importantly, will Holstaur ice cream make an appearance in later chapter? Tune in next time to find out. DaDa Dum Dum DaDaDaDa DaDa DaDaDa Da Dum. Peace Fam!

It's been a little while a lot's happened. Came back from Maryland for this internship for my mechanical engineering studies. It was fun, I learned some interesting stuff about the automobile industry and mechatronics. Preparing for my fifth semester in college and hoping for the best. Now this chapter turned out to be a bit longer than expected and there's still a lot more I want to consider moving forward. I decided to break it into two parts to make my life a bit easier and keep the story going. Anyway let's get right to it. Don't forget to Fav, Follow, Share, and Comment and what not.In the country side in south Western Alabama, there was a small church having stood on it's foundation for the better part of a century. On the back was a large grassy area filled with the grave stones of the dearly departed. This church was special, for it was the church many members of the Bizzell family were buried as per their tradition.Standing amongst the grave stones was Caleb in his teens, who just finished high school. It was cloudy, it looked like it could rain any second yet not a single drop fell. He stood in front of two head stones aligned next to each other and a reef of flowers around them. He stood as tears ran down his face looking at the names on the stones. They were his parents. He looked up to the sky as if questioning to the heavens and to God, Why?"It's all your fault.", said a female voice shaking with rage."Dumbass, why'd you even come?", said another angry more masculine voice.Caleb whipped around to see his older brother and sister standing with absolute disdain on their faces. He could feel his soul shrinking under their hateful gazes."No. I...It's not...I didn't ask them to...", Caleb whimpered before being cut off.'IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT. YOU TOOK THEM FROM US. THEY DIED BECAUSE OF YOU AND YOU STAND HERE TRYING TO PASS THE BLAME.', His sister screamed tears running down her face." YOU RUINED OUR FAMILY.", His brother shouted angrily."No.", Caleb whimpered falling to his knees with despair on his face." It should've been you.", "Mama should've never brought yo ass into this world ""AAGHHGHGGH", Caleb wailed clutching his fingers the grass as the sky turned a somber grey. His tears stained his face and mucus ran down his top lip as his former siblings continued to berate and vilify him. He suddenly heard two voices call from behind and with trembling motion looked to see his parents standing behind their own head stones with faces as stiff and lifeless as the stone itself. " I'M SORRY AGHAHGHHG"Caleb's eyes shot open with his heart palpitating and his chest rising and falling erratically from the awful stress. It's been a while since he's had that dream usually he's been so occupied with Mirabelle invading his mind at night that it practically never occurred. He calmed himself and the first thing Caleb noticed upon waking was a throbbing pain in the back of his head and between his eyes. The back was damp and warm. Was he bleeding? Upon wincing and attempting massage away the pain, he noticed his hands were bound in front of him with rope as were his legs. He was lying on his side and began surveying his surroundings. He was lying on concrete floor, in a large room slightly illuminated by rows of industrial incandescent lights. In the room center were several stacks of boxes and lumber with a saw station and multiple other tools spread around. He was inside of an iron welded partition cage and looking behind him, he saw bags of cement mix, a couple small ladders, and an empty plastic waste basket behind him. Rising up, a little to get a better view, he realized the cage was connected to several others each with a lock and chain and a having prisoner. All of them devils, succubi, or whatever the media calls them.Narrator Side note-'Ever since angels and devils were confirmed to be real, many Christian and other religious groups were ecstatic over the possible existence of heaven and hell. However, there's still no definite confirmation as many believe their species are, like other liminals, just a product of evolution or genetic mutation. No one is really certain where the angel and devil species originate from, hell not even either of the species themselves. Nevertheless, their existence led to many people showing outward acceptance and adoration towards the angels and course a loathsome fear, hatred, persecution toward devils. Especially in predominantly Christian and Catholic areas like the Southern United States.'By Caleb's count, there were at least 9 of them. A few of them were sobbing and some paced around their cages nervously. Fear slowly began to creep into his bones.Where the hell am I?, Caleb thought getting a searing headache."Awake huh?", A somewhat familiar voice grunted catching his attention. He nudged his body around to the cage next to him and saw one of them eyeing him suspiciously kneeling down as she tended to torn wing. Caleb's eyes widened in realization.I remember now. She's that devil I found injured in the street. I was gonna get he help and..., Caleb thought rising up slightly to get a better look at her and his surroundings, only to grit his teeth from the sharp pain in the head, he then looked down at the tiny smear of blood where his head was previously, Guess I picked the wrong time to be a good Samaritan."Yeah, Uh..ack god my head. Who are you and where are we?", Caleb asked rubbing his bound hands to his forehead.The devil woman pulled her knees to her chest pressing he back to the other side of the cage. Her expression was somber as she looked at Caleb before answering, " It won't matter if I did tell you hombre. As for where you are, some old warehouse these pendejos are using. Mi amigos... and I...are going to be sold as some bastardo's personal sex toys or be forced into prostitution.", She finished touching a metal collar around her neck."W-What? Holy fuckin-wait, hold on, why won't it matter to know your name?", Caleb inquired getting his head together." Because they're going to kill you, obviously. They can't have any witnesses and I doubt they'd take a chance on you snitchin to the policia.", she said plainly looking away at the other devils who all had fearful and despairing expressions. She sunk her head down to her knees rubbing her now bandaged arm with her free hand."B-But you're a devil right? Can't you just use your magic to get yourself out?", Caleb inquired slightly adjusting himself more. Seriously, every time he thought about the fact the magic ACTUALLY EXISTS he immediately felt like questioning everything he knew about the universe." Afraid it isn't that simple. See des?", The devil lady pointed at her neck showing a metal collar with odd symbol on it, "These inbred a-holes somehow got ahold of neck collars imbued with filthy angel magic that seals our abilities. We're basically weaker than you humans right now."Caleb's eyes shot open in horror as his heart rate skyrocketed. Survival instincts kicking in, he looked around cautiously for any way out. It seemed fruitless until something shiny in the corner of the cage just underneath the ladder leg caught his eye. He inched himself closer and used his free fingers to pry out a small slightly rusted knife blade. Thanking whatever god was looking out for him, he placed the blade in his middle and index finger and began gingerly cutting at the knots on his wrists. She then spoke again having not noticed his previous actions."Look, hombre. I'm not gonna apologize for your involvement is this, cuz you're the one who chose not to mind your own business. But...for what its worth... thanks for a least trying to help. That's more than I ever got since coming to this country.", she said sullenly messing with a broken link on the cage wall.Caleb gave her a quizzical look and couldn't decide if she was being sarcastic or not. He decided to ignore it and just said, " Well I should apologize. You see, I'm just not the one to turn away from someone if its within my means to help them. And you know what, it matters to me that you at least know my name, its Caleb. Caleb Bizzell. "The devil stared at him in curiously before a small smirk appeared on her lips, "Heh, nice name. Guess this counts as our introduction as well a goodbye.""Yeah, wish we could've in better circumstances. Probably been good friends.", Caleb spoke sincerely as their eyes met. She saw how they were filled with genuine warmth and care. A look she hadn't been given in a very, very long." Camila", she spoke softly averting her eyes."Huh?""My name. It's Camila de Alma Hermosa Santana", she said meekly as her Spanish accent rolled each word." heh, beautiful name for a beautiful lady.", Caleb muttered as she blushed lightly at the compliment." Think of it as a final wish for man", Camila uttered morosely leaning look toward the dirty windows at the night sky.Caleb stopped cutting momentarily and looked into her piercing blue demonic eyes, the flickering light above them making them glow eerily. He let the situation sink in more. He could die here, like, ACTUALLY die. To be honest, he was already mostly dead inside anyway and considered for a second just resigning to his fate. But, something kept nudging at him, an irritating nudge like someone repeatedly poking your face to wake you up. It was the thought of leaving Mirabelle and Lyca alone. He needed to get out of there. But how?Then a loud click could be heard as the room suddenly got brighter and the sound of footsteps attracted everyone's attention. Caleb laid back down just enough that he was unnoticeable pretending to still be unconscious.Two men walked in. One of was heavily built with large gut, a rounded face and bald head with a due rag tied to his forehead and shaggy beard, black pants, a blue undershirt over jean jacket. The other guy was tall, and slightly more muscular than his partner and wore a plan black shirt with black suit windbreaker over it and grey jeans. He was surprisingly well-groomed and wore a small gold chain on his pants. He kinda looked like Ryan Renolds as a gangster. Caleb looked over at Camila from before as she glared at the hatefully with her once blue eyes were now had a vicious blood red glow."I'm telling ya man this is where the money's at.", said Gangster Renolds running his finger past the cages as he walked by them, "Succubi sell like hot cakes and with these hosts willing to let us buy them off for half what they're worth on the black market we're basically printing money.", he finished with an iniquitous chuckle."He he, yeah I can see why. A guy would pay handsomely to get some this here succubus puss. At least little Satans are good for somethin' ", said Fat Bastard (that's what I'm calling him now, and I think it fits.) as he stopped by one of the cages where a short blue skinned devil girl in black knee high boots, short shorts and cutoff top sat her back to the cage. She shuddered in fear as Fat Bastard gazed at her lecherously licking his bottom lip, "These things were made for our pleasure."Caleb felt a tinge of disgust shoot through him and it took all his strength to avoid blowing his cover. He could hear the sound of rattling metal as he peaked through one eye to see Camila shaking with rage.As they walked by, chatting to each other, Caleb got a sudden idea. While they were distracted looking over the succubi they were about to sell, he knelt in and began cutting at the restraints on his leg but making sure not to cut all the way through just enough so the men don't notice, same with his wrists. When he had finished, he started to hide the blade in his pocket but stopped when he noticed Camila next to him eyeing him curiously. She leaned forward noticing the blade sticking out of his pocket. Caleb with his finger to shush before quickly lying back down. She leaned in about to ask him something before being interrupted by a loud shriek."NO, You can't. Please.", a blue devil girl screamed as the Fat Bastard held her by the wrists. She flailed trying desperately to get free and he scooped her up wrapping himself around her holding her arms in place. Camila next to Caleb continued to glare at the man with furious disgust looking as if she wanted to tear him apart.Gangster Renolds looked over at his partner, " What the hell you doin' man, these girls gotta be in one piece before the buyers get here. Don't need you damaging the goods.""Aw come on now Mac, we can afford to take one or two for a test drive. Gotta make sure they up to standard", Fat Bastard said as roughly grabbed the girls' inner thigh; warranting a startled gasp then her swiping him across the face with her claws leaving a bleeding mark on his cheek. He lurched back in pain hold his cheek before angrily shouted at her, " little BITCH", then smacking her hard across the check sending her rolling on the floor cringing from the shock."HEY, What did I just say? Don't damage the merchandise. You fuckin idiot.", Gangster Renolds (Yes, I heard his name but I like mine better.) shoved and berated Fat Bastard.Caleb heard the rattling sound from Camila next to him as she stood up aggressively shaking the cage door as she saw the blue devil girl on the ground still cringing. She clenched her fists baring her fangs and reviled the two men "ESTA ABAJO SIN CRESTA PERRA CULO BASTARDOS ('You low-down bitch ass bastards", in case you were curious.) When I get out of here, I'LL TEAR YOU LIMB FROM LIMB. Starting with you ya fuckin fat ass." She finished pointing at Fat Bastard.Fat Bastard was about to say something before his partner stopped him.Gangster Renolds whipped around and walked clearly irritated by the outspoken devil lady, to which Caleb quickly laid back down. Renolds got to her cage door and stood in front of her neither side backing down, "You know, I'm getting real tired of your mouth. Maybe after I finally sell you off somebody can find a better use for it.""Jes, maybe I can enthrall them with stories of what an enormous pussy you are.", she snarled at him." Keep talking succubus.", Gangster Renolds said pulling out a small black handgun, "This time I'll blow off that tail of yours."She held her bandaged arm before retorting, " Well at least that gun of yours can make a girl feel something. Besides, disappointment."Caleb listened to their back and forth, all the while resisting the urge to go 'oof' with each burn Camila dished out. Then it started to escalate dangerously."YOU KNOW WHAT FUCK IT. We'll get plenty with others here. Im'ma KILL this cum gobbling wench.", Gangster Renolds said pointing the pistol at Camila's heard. She stared at him unflinchingly and slowly closed her eyes. Suddenly heard a low jingle sound, a looked for the source to find Caleb still 'unconscious' his chest rising and falling slowly and light moving his leg against the gateI wonder if that got his attention, Caleb thought. He had deliberately tapped the side of the gate.Gangster Renolds moved over observing Caleb as Camila looked on with clear interest at them. " HEY, Bill, thought I told you get rid of this darky!""Ahhh, that bastard not goin nowhere. Time he come to, we'll be long gone.", Fat Bastard (you know the drill. Now accept it.) said as he dragged the whimpering blue devil back to her cage throwing her to the ground then once again eyeing her." Well, looks like he'll be wakin up sooner than you think. Now go on take him out back and put a bullet in his head. Now!", Renolds chastised his partner who looked back forth between him and the before letting out an annoyed groan."Yeah, yeah alright.", Fat Bastard groaned taking his pistol off a wooden plank then stuffing it down his pants, " Hey, let me see them keys I left phone on the dashboard ". Renolds handed the set of keys to him and Fat Bastard used one of them to take the lock off of Caleb's door. Caleb used all his concentration to keep playing possom as Fat Bastard slung him over his shoulder and walking out to the back door leading outside." Throw some of that cement over him when you're done.",Gangster Renolds said shooting Camila one last glare before going off to another room. Camila watched them leave feeling a frown form on her face....They were out on the back of the warehouse. It was incredibility dark out with only the half quarter moon and the telephone pole lights to illuminate their surroundings. The warehouse appeared to be in rural area connected along the main highway with a few dilapidated buildings and a couple houses in the distance. There was practically no one around, save for a few homeless people and the occasional vehicle passersby. Around them were building supplies, a piles of bricks along a half completed walkway, stacks of plywood, and wide trench dug with a cement mixer just at the edge. Fat Bastard grunted as he carried Caleb over near the trench. He knelt allowing Caleb to fall limply to the ground with a thud.Arrgh fuckin fuuuuck!, Caleb internally screamed as he discretely clenched his teeth still doing his best to keep up his charade.Fat Bastard then walked over to Caleb standing with his legs over Caleb's to give himself better aim. Caleb snapped out of his thoughts as processed the situation. He had know idea what he was going to do but he had to do it fast." Heh, boy, you picked the wrong night to be some broad's hero.", He snickered as he cocked his pistol directly at Caleb ready to pull the trigger. He finger was about to squeeze until...Fat Bastard noticed the ropes on Caleb's legs weren't gripping him as tight as before. Upon closer examination, he saw a few of the loops had been mostly cut through."What in the h-", was the last thing Fat Bastard uttered before lurched forward writhing in agony holding his groin as Caleb, who's body reacted COMPLETELY on instinct, sent a devastating full powered double kick to the fat man's nether region. As Fat Bastard cried in agony Caleb quickly followed with another solid double kick to the man's forehead causing him to tumble and fall backwards in a daze.Caleb then quickly tore off the ropes around his wrists and the remaining loops on his legs that hadn't snapped from the force of the kick. He stumbled a bit getting and trying to get the blood in his legs circulating again. He exhaled sharply as the numbness left his hands." AHHGGH YOU FUCKIN BLACK BASTARD", Fat Bastard cried out struggling to get to his feet and trying to aim his gun at Caleb."Oh Shit.", Caleb exclaimed before noticing a brick just near his foot. He quickly scooped it up and chucked it at the fat man striking him right in the face with an audible sound of bone cracking. He fell back with a yelp, subsequently firing off one round from his gun before tumbling down into the ditch. Caleb froze for a second after hearing the noise and shakily approached the ditch. Fat Bastard lay face down in the dirt with his gun on the jump a few inches away from his hand. Caleb took a deep breath and climb down into the ditch turning the fat man over. He had on big bruise on his pale skin with a stream of blood slightly leak down his face. Caleb felt his stomach form into knots and swallowed hard as he hesitantly placed his middle and index finger to his chubby neck. He still had a pulse to which Caleb exhaled in relief; he wasn't a murderer. Caleb then proceeded to relieve the man of a few things: His gun obviously, the keys to whatever vehicle they had, and his bandana; which Caleb fashioned into a gag before using the remaining pieces of rope he had to bind the Bastards hands. After finish tying him up, Caleb noticed a very familiar looking Pokemon wallet sticking out of the man's pocket; Caleb's wallet. Caleb grimaced in disgust as he took it and opened it up. It WAS, in fact HIS wallet and thankfully none of his credit or bank cards were missing but the rest of his money was gone."Knock a brother out from behind and then robbing him? Straight dirty mother ERRGH", Caleb hissed finishing his sentence with a growl and kick to the man's stomach.Caleb climbed out of the ditch. He exhaled brushing himself off and looked around cautiously making sure his partner wasn't nearby. Though he was not experienced with using a gun, unless BBs count, it made him feel a bit safer knowing he had some means of defense. He took the keys, which appeared to be made up of the Car key, the fuel tank key, and 5 others that probably served some purpose. He kept pressing the unlock button on the car remote and walked around looking for the vehicle it operates. Suddenly he stopped and saw a distinctive flashing red light coming from the other side of the building with a dirt driveway. He followed it and came upon a large black cargo van it's head and tail lights still on from unlocking doors. It looked exactly like the ones use by exchange program personnel.This must have been how they transported me and the succubi here unnoticed, Caleb thought walking around to the driver's side door and climbing inside. He turned the key in the ignition careful not to start the engine just yet and saw the fuel gage was couple notches shy of a full tank. He looked through the small rectangular hole in the wall separating the driver and passenger seats and the empty space in the back; save for a couple large boxes near the doors, Looks I found my way out of here.OK, now I should get out of here and tell MON and the cops about this place. Then I'll-, Caleb's thoughts were cut short when he noticed another vehicle-a black and red van suspiciously slowing down the road with it's lights completely off and then began to turn into the front of the warehouse. Caleb quickly turned off the ignition hoping for dear life they didn't see the van lights on. He ducked down into the seat to hide as he heard three door slams. He peeked slightly over the steering wheel and noticed three unsavory looking men. One of them, a middle-aged John Wick looking man who was probably the leader. Gangster Renolds suddenly emerged walking out greeting them."Evening gentleman. Glad you made it, did find the place ok-", Renolds prattled on before being stopped by Wick." How about you quit trying to kiss my ass and show me what you have on the market. Or should I take my business somewhere else?", Wick asked with clear malice in his voice not liking his time wasted."Oh, sho'nough no need to be hasty. Right this way now, I have some of the finest critters this side of Cullman county.", Renolds nervously chuckled before showing Wick and his compatriots inside." By the way, where's that other guy? The fat one with the beard.", Renolds said"Oh, uhhh, he's taking care of some 'trash' in back. He should be done in a little bit.", Reynolds replied nonchalantly.When the coast was clear Caleb rose back up with pensive expression on his face.So I'm in Cullman? That's 45 minutes from Huntsville! What am I going to do now? Even if I went for help, they wouldn't arrive in time. Most of the succubi could have been sold off by then. Gah, why did I have to get involved in this!? I was just having fun with Mirabelle and the others, why am I here? Maybe...I should just go...and don't look back, Caleb thought shutting his eyes as his hand trembled on the key to start the ignition. All the while flashes of memories of the young women suffering in there, then at Camila who he tried to save. Was he really just going to abandon them? Could he forgive himself for that? Would he be proving his brother and sister right about him? More importantly, what would Mirabelle, Lyca, and Uncle Andrew and Vanessa think of him? His eyes shot open and as he pulled the key out gripping it tightly. Dammit, dammit, dammit what the hell am I doing?!, Caleb screamed internally before getting out of the vehicle and going to the back opening of the van doors. He began to search through the boxes for anything could use then looked through his pockets for his phone. It was gone. He cursed to himself before a thought occurred to him; the Fat Bastard said he left HIS phone on the dashboard. Caleb went to the passenger seat to search the dashboard and found it. He pressed the power button bringing up menu screen and swiped up-luckily, there was no lock screen. Caleb winced slightly at his wallpaper which consisted of a naked Monoeye girl with her legs spread revealing everything and tears in her eyes. That poor girl. Caleb grumbled in disgust before activating the camera feature turning the flash on high. He went over to the license plate on the van and snapped a couple pics of it then went to the other car and did the same. He then sent the images along with a short message to the one person he knows can help."Come on, please get it.", Caleb muttered to himself going back to the van and looking through the vehicle and boxes again. One of the boxes he found a mini megaphone, several empty red, white and blue wine bottles like the ones he saw at the stands earlier, a tactical flashlight, a large battery powered fan, and bunch of extension chords. The other was filled with an assortment of female clothes, probably for the succubi they captured. He then search around the glove compartment and under the seats rummaging through trash and...other things(cringe). He managed to find a taser, still with plenty of voltage, super glue and a few fireworks. Caleb looked at what he had to work with and nodded as his internal light bulb went off. He had a plan." Alright sometimes...the only fuckin way is the hard way.", Caleb ruminated a phrase of his late father's picking up the fan and flashlight and looking up YouTube on the phone.*********Meanwhile**********It was 3:00am at the Bizzell household and a police car could be seen flashing outside alongside Sterling's car. Mirabelle and Lyca had called Sterling and the police, reporting Caleb had gone missing. After, they went through the crime scene they took them back to Caleb's house for questioning and to make sure no accomplices were in the area. Lyca strongly insisted that they simply track him down using her keen sense of smell. However, Sterling knew it would be dangerous to go running into a Caleb's kidnappers' hideout without backup or Intel. Through much convincing on his part and a little from Mirabelle, she reluctantly submitted.Inside Lyca was pacing back and biting at a pillow and whining like a wounded puppy in between low growls. Mirabelle wasn't doing much better as shakily handed the police officers each a cup of coffee from a serving tray all while a look of complete worry as she tried to fight back tears. They each took a cup thanking her before continuing their report. Sterling sat at the kitchen counter massaging away a migraine and adding a little bourbon to his coffee. Normally, he would be upset about being called up so late at night but after he heard Mirabelle in such distress over the phone AND Caleb was missing he instantly flew into overdrive."OK, you last saw him when you left the park. You each went back to retrieve something you misplaced and when you returned he was nowhere in sight with his phone on the ground, on the opposite side of the street, and blood present.", said one of the police officers holding an evidence bag with Caleb's phone in it." Y-yes *sniff*", Mirabelle said shakily wiping her eyes as Sterling gave the man an inquisitive stare."We're very sorry ma'am. We just need any information we can get to help find him. But, please can you two answer a couple more questions?", Another police officer said looking at Lyca and Mirabelle. Both looked at him with despairing eyes causing him to rub his throat nervously." Yes" "Yes", both of them said in unison." Right, so. Did your host have any enemies? Anyone who had any kind of grievance or malice towards the police officer asked taking out a clipboard."N-No, of course not. Chief is the kindest, most patient guy I ever met. He's nice to everyone and anyone ever did want to hurt him I'd find out and I'd tear'em a new asshole!", Lyca snarled digging her claws into the pillow nearly ripping it apart.The police, Mirabelle, Sterling stared at the agitated werewolf as she mean mugged the officer who asked the question."... Um, No. Caleb is a kind person.", Mirabelle stated as the officer wrote down something on the clipboard." Do you know if your host is involved with any...illegal activity? ", the officer hesitated afraid to ask." THE HELL KIND OF QUESTION IS...", Lyca growled before Mirabelle gently placed her hand on her shoulder giving her a pleading expression. Lyca slowly sunk back into her position calming down a bit but still glaring at the officer sending shivers down his spine, "No, he certainly isn't", Lyca said through her teeth. She then jumped over the couch hugging her knees to her chest as she growled lowly biting the pillow." O-Ok. Then we need someone to file a missing person's report? Agent Sterling? ",said the officer." Yes, please, get it out immediately. ", Sterling said. The officer then finished writing then went to his partner to talk. His partner pulled out a walkie talkie and began putting out a report at the station.Sterling stood looking at the police then to the Mirabelle who was tearfully trying to comfort a quivering Lyca as her tough facade slowly chipped away. He felt his heart sink into his stomach watching them so worried about their host's safety. He then took out his phone to call a few members from MON to watch the two worried liminals.Ahhhgg, Bizzell where are you? I hope you're alright, Sterling thought bringing up his contacts before a text message flashed across his screen. He raised an eyebrow as it was from a number unfamiliar to him. His eyes suddenly widened when the name 'Caleb' was present as he skimmed it. He opened the message a bit anxious and noticed to pictures of what appeared to be two different license plates and a message at the bottom...Caleb" Oh my God, officers, OFFICERS! I just got a message...from CALEB", Sterling stated still reading the message catching everyone's attention. Lyca and Mirabelle tore away from each other in surprise looking at Sterling with their ears fully alert to hear the message."OK, it say. : Sterling, it's Caleb. I've been abducted but I managed to escape.", Sterling read aloud. Mirabelle wore a hopeful expression holding her clasped hands together in prayer as tears of joy streamed down her face. Lyca stood up over the couch leaning toward Sterling with a b smile as her tail wagged energetically.My captors appear to be running an underground liminal sex trafficking ring. Use the license plates I sent of their vehicles to locate us. There's four of them. Previously five, but I got him knocked out tied up in a trench out back. PLEASE HURRY, THEY HAVE GUNS., Sterling finished as both girl's reaction devolved from ecstatic to horror and shock at the last part. Sterling whipped around showing the police the license plate numbers."Right, we just sent the numbers to the station. They'll trace the vehicle location then we'll dispatch immediately.", the officer said heading out the door." OK, Mirabelle, Lyca, I'll be sending a few agents from MON to look after you in the meantime. Stay in the house and-", Sterling was interrupted when Lyca snatched his phone from behind hold it in vice grip claws."Gramps, there's no way in hell we're staying put! Not while the man I adore is in life threatening danger! You're taking us with you!", Lyca proclaimed puffing her chest out with arms crossed trying to look bigger."T-That's right! I will not hide while my beloved needs us.", Mirabelle stated with a look of sheer determination.Sterling gave them both stern looks of disapproval. Then he lingered on Mirabelle, who he could barely recognize right now. They stood like that for a good 30 seconds neither side wavering until Sterling finally conceded. He might be written up for this but fuck it. " Fine, but when things get too dangerous I want you both to do what I say. Got it?""YES!" "RIGHT!", both girls answered.**********BACK AT THE WAREHOUSE**********" And this one here was grown right on American soil.", Gangster Renolds said walking with the men showing the succubi in cages. He stopped at one of the cages flashing his pistol at the girl to make his point before unlocking it and pulling out of the cage by the arm. The blonde pony-tailed tan-skinned succubi wore a button up white shirt, black stockings, and camo skirt."Now this darlin right here. Good facial bone structure, lovely honey blonde hair.", He gripped her cheeks showing displaying her face. The whimpering girl with tears in her eyes shuddered as his filthy hands roamed around her body, "And, as expected of her kind, curves for day, cleavage that can make any baby weep, and buttocks tight as a drum. Yes sir, god bless her soul."He paused for a second letting the bad pun sink in, "HAA, GET IT? cuz they're devils and they ain't got no souls.""Booooo, pinchazo. Get off the stage! You suck!", the devil woman taunted getting their attention as Gangster Renolds shot her a vicious glare and was about to cuss her out before being interrupted." What about that one? She seems to have quite a bit of fire left in her.", Wick said pointing to the cage"Ah she's just some parasite we picked up awhile back. We had a bit of trouble with her so we had to rough her up some so she knows her place.", Renolds said.Wick walked past Renolds towards her cage as his men followed. Renolds then shoved the devil girl from earlier back into her cage. She let out a painful yelp as she landed on tail bone.Wick stood at her cage examining her from head to toe much to her disgust. He then noticed he slightly torn wing and said to Renolds, " Now, that's no way to treat a lady. Especially one with... so much...potential." He then looked back at Camila, " Tell me, you have a name to match your passion?""Jes, first name: Fuck, last name: You", she hissed."Hehehe, Charming. A spunky attitude combined with a resolute demeanor.", he then looked her up and down examining her every feature like a judge at a dog show. From her curves to her still torn wing raising an eyebrow with a nod as she glared at him in revulsion, " Hm, and in really good condition all things considered. What's the going rate?""It's 5,000 for the smaller ones and between 30-50 for taller ones like that one. But for you, I'll give you a couple small fries for 2,500 each.", Reynalds said with smirk at Camila." Very well, I'll take a couple of those lesser devils over there and for Ms. Fuck You over here...I'll pay 35,000", Wick said as Camila's cringed slightly in horror. She then looked over at the two lesser devils he pointed at; they were sisters and they were holding each other crying. She gripped her trembling hand on the cage wire.Wick snapped his finger and his cohort opened a suitcase taking out several stacks of money and putting them in a plastic bag. He looked back at Camila with raised eyebrow as she barred her long sharp fangs at him."But before we proceed, I going to have to examine this one to make sure she's good fit for my collection.", Wick said raising an eyebrow at Camila." he he you got it my good man", Renolds snickered walking over to Camila's cage shooting her a vindictive smirk preparing to unlock her cage."YOU KEEP YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF OF ME OR I'LL—", Camila snarled before the sound of a few guns cocking caught her attention and she saw three of Wick's men pointing their pistols at her with Renolds lifting his shirt up revealing his just in case." You will be a GOOD little girl and comply. I'd hate to have my money go to waste over a little uncooperative behavior. Consequently, those two little imps over there are…expendable. They would just become a couple house pets anyway. So, either be reasonable or I kill one them and have YOU choose which one lives.", Wick finished with a noticeable venom lacing each word.Camila clenched her fangs fighting back a few tears as she shook with rage. She arms then hung limply as she looked down dejectedly in defeat. Renolds started to unlock her cage until...A police siren could be heard from outside the building catching everyone's attention. They look at the large dirty glass window as blue and red lights flashed outside. For all the men there, their blood ran cold as they looked back and forth between each other. Suddenly, a loud voice could heard over a megaphone."WE KNOW YOU ARE IN THERE AND WE HAVE YOU SURROUNDED. RELEASE THE EXTRA-SPECIES AND COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP."Many of the devils in their cages rose up in surprise, hope filling them with realization they were somehow saved. Camila felt the same as a small smile grew on her face. There was also something about the voice on the megaphone, she felt she heard it somewhere.Wick gritted his teeth in frustration taking out a revolver and pointing it at Renolds temple as the latter sunk down to his knees holding up his hands begging for his worthless life."Boy, just what the hell you trying pull here huh? Trying to set me up? You working for the damn cops or that M.O.N. group?!", Wick inquired becoming more agitated by the minute." NO, I-I-I-I-I-I don't know what, how or why they know about this place? It's supposed to be out of the way from any state troopers. Hell, no one's been in this place in months.", Renolds spoke pleadingly. Wick looked around intently for a second before asking, "What about your partner? How long does it take to get rid of a little garbage.""Nah, nah, no Bill, h-he ain't no snitch. Besides he wanted that money just as much as me.", Renolds uttered before he realized Fat Bastard HAS been gone a bit longer than expected." THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING. COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP.""Boss, I can see what looks like about two cars. I think they're parked behind the brick walls entrance.", said one of Wick's men." Hmm, if we stay here they'll just close in on us. I think we can still sneak out, Andy go check the back for escape routes. Mark go round the side and check out their positions and both of you report back in 3.", he said to his thugs and they complied going out to their positions.The man came to the back door and cautiously opened it scanning for any officer's with his gun at point. He took a step outside looking off toward where the parked and failing to notice the figure behind him. Next thing he knew he felt a sudden white-hot pain at his neck as he fell to the ground convulsing and dropping his gun into a small pile of dirt. Then feeling a sharp blow to the head knocking him out. He was then dragged over to the trench where Fat Bastard lay still unconscious.Two down, the assailant thought putting the taser away and picking up the gun that the guy dropped. He then heard footsteps approaching from the side of the building and ducked inside through the back door hiding in darkness behind a wood pile."What the hell? Why aren't they saying nothin' now?!", Renolds exclaimed looking out at the still flashing lights, " It came from out back. Are they trying sneak their way in?""Shut the fuck up. I don't think they know just how many of us they're dealing with, how many monsters are in here, or what kind of firepower we have. Hell, they probably not sure if it's just humans running this operation., Wick said rubbing his temple with the butt of his revolver, " They could just be waiting for backup like that MON squad to arrive."Wick then looked around at the devils who mostly now had more relaxed expressions on their faces. He stood up snapping them out of their thought and began walking around as the sets of black and multicolored eyes followed him cautiously."~Heh, looks like somebody's getting scared~", Camila hummed catching both his and Renolds attention. In a fit of rage, Renolds ran walked up to her cage with pure frustration at the sharp-tongued woman." YOU SHUT YUR GODDAMN WHORE MOUTH.", be shouted brandishing his pistol at her forehead as she simply smirked at him. He felt the urge to pull that trigger and end her right now."Hey, you need to calm your ass down. We need as many hostages as possible. Right now, these little cum dumpsters are our only leverage.", Wick said walking up next to Renolds." When the 9 hells did you start calling the shots?!", Renolds retorted with clear discontent."Since you and your partner apparently COULDN'T keep this business on the motherfuckin down low", Wick snarled back at him causing Reynold to recoil back. He could help but feel that he was probably right and a migraine shot through his skull as he tried to compose himself to no avail." Gah...I ju-...AND WHERE THE FUCK IS BILL? BILL!", Renolds screamed out still curious about his absent partner.Suddenly the door leading out to the side of slowly creeper open catching the criminal's attention. The readied their firearms for who was about to come the through. The door opened wider as a humanoid figure came through. They prepared to fire but quickly withdrew upon realizing it was one of Wick's men. He then walked to his boss with a somewhat confused expression."Well...what did you see? How many are out there? What are their positions?",Wick inquired before noticing the man's awkward expression, " Mark, man What? What's up?""Uhhh...you uh", he paused for a second, " You guys might wanna come out and see this?"He held open the door for them to follow. They were still wary because of the police lights still flashing but reluctantly followed him. They weren't worried about the devils as they were locked up tight.As the men left outside, they failed to notice a figure watching them leave from the shadows. He snuck out from the darkness coming slightly into the light. One the smaller devils took notice of him immediately letting out a startled chirp and alerting the others to his presence....Outside of the building Wick and Renolds followed cautiously behind Mark whom just casually strolled on much to their confusion. He went up to the brick and stock just above where the police lights were flashing. By no police car was in sight. Both men went up to the brick wall and Mark pulled down what was producing the lights.A large fan with its screen taken off had three glass bottles glued to the they spun, a tactical flashlight, which had been glued diagonally to the fan, shown an intense light on the glass as the spun producing flashes. So bright it hurt their eyes to look at it forces Mark to turn of the flashlight. Each of them gave each other odd looks then to the contraption that had deceived. Wick was the first to speak up."What...in the hell...am I looking at?", He asked incredulously." Is...Is my flashlight I got off Amazon? ", Renolds asked as the other two men each raised an eyebrow at him....The devils each murmured to each other as they gazed curiously at the dark-skinned man walked up to them holding a set of keys in his right hand. Camila starred blankly in utter shock, mouth agape trying to find the right words to say. She stood gripping her cage and uttered, " Wha?..H-How?...I...you""He he it's good to see you again too.", Caleb chuckled lightly rubbing the back of his head.Ohhhhh—K, that looks like a good place to leave off. Now, with this semester slowly creeping up on me, I might decide to go on a hiatus for a little while. I'll still be writing, but mostly be focused on my engineering classes (especially Mechanics of Materials and Intro to EE, that shit is gonna be a nightmare *wink*). Now I want to give a little shout out to a couple writers on this sight: Superairraptor and demonblade3 if you like the Monster Musume franchise go and check out their content and support them too. Especially my boi demonblade3, he's been having a very rough and could use the love. Alright, as usual, Fav, Follow, Comment. Peace Fam

    Chapter 8: No Rest For The Wicked Part 2FOR ONE THOUSAND YEARS I LAY DORMANT. WHO DARE DISTURB MY SLUM—oh it's you guys. Ok, on where we left off.Chapter 9: No Rest for the Wicked Part 2The once tense and grim atmosphere of the room was now filled with curious murmurs from the devil women as they eyed the dark-skinned man cautiously. The one with the most befuddled expression was the devil woman by the name of Camilla."H-How are you still alive?! I heard the gunshot.", Camilla inquired as the other devils centered their attention on him watching his every move with gross suspicion." Three years of judo practice, a rusty blade, and a shit ton of luck.", he said as he went over to her cage sorting through the keys to find the one for the locks. Luckily, there were only seven and he could easily sort out the car and gas tank key until found the one he was looking for."What about the fatass?", Camilla asked." He's taking a long dirt nap" he said prompting a surprised look from Camilla and even some of the other devil girls. He noticed this and quickly elaborated, " Oh, no, I didn't kill him or nothin'! I just knocked him out brick and tied him up. Along with, one those guys that with that other man."Caleb stopped for a second hearing himself out loud and realizing how bad that sounded. But, like he said, they AREN'T dead. Concussed and probably paralyzed but not dead.Camilla was silent for a moment trying to process this new development. She was just about to be sold off into life of suffering and now the man who tried and failed to help her earlier and assumed had been killed is now standing before her with the literal keys to her freedom. The audible sound of the lock popping off snapped her out of her thoughts as Caleb unwound the chain dropping it to the floor. The gate slowly opened as Camilla rose to her feet, stumbling and wincing from the pain of her bandaged thigh then stepping out eyeing Caleb as the other devils let out surprised gasps at their now freed comrade."Which way did they go out?", Caleb inquired. She showed him the side door to the outside near the cage he was previously in, " OK, here unlock the rest, I'll block this entrance. I already took care of the entrance on the front of the building. "Camilla raised an eyebrow and said, "Wait, what about the policia? Aren't the still outside?""Yeah, about that.", Caleb began as he pulled out a crowbar from the pile of tools, " It was a little trick of mine that I'm certain they've discovered by now. So, we really, REALLY need to hurry. "He jammed the crowbar in between the wedges of the door. Then began pushing a couple metal oil drum filled with scrap metal shavings in front of it just to be safe.Camilla was surprised by his answer and wondered how he was able to pull that off. She could ask what he did later; right now, she needed to free the succubi. She went to the first cage in front of her and quickly undid the lock. A greater devil with magenta irises and black scaleras stepped out cautiously wearing a jean skirt and red blouse. She wore simple black sandals. Next, were pair of lesser devil twins. Both with blue skin, red eyes, and both dressed in simple white tank tops and red skirts. Only differences between them was one had long hair in a ponytail and the other had short hair in pigtails. Then, she unlocked two more cages, one with a blonde greater devil in a maid outfit(idk) and another with red hair in twin tails wearing short pants and red blouse. Finally, Camilla arrived at the cage of the blonde camo skirted succubus girl from earlier and put the key into her lock. To her shock, it didn't fit into the tried it with other two remaining cages with the same result."Come on. Come on...argh, por que (why?) ", Camilla exclaimed as she clutched the key in frustration. The freed devils stood behind her with worried expressions. At the same time, Caleb moved came up to her." what? What's wrong?", he asked ignoring the strange looks from the other girls.Camilla let out a sigh looking at the pleading face of the blonde maid succubus still in the cage, "The key...it doesn't work for their locks. They must have another one somewhere.""No time to look, stand back.", Caleb said as he took the Camilla backed away from the lock and chain. He signaled for the blonde for the blonde succubus to do the same. He pulled a pistol with a silencer from the back of his pants inciting startled yelps from several of the ladies. Even Camilla was shocked to see him with a gun. He aimed at the lock and fired off a ground breaking it along with part of the chain. He opened the cage offering a hand to the devil woman. She recoiled slightly but then reluctantly took his hand.The blonde succubus stepped out looking between him and the other freed devils, " D-danke", she muttered hesitantly trying to conceal her thick German accent."You're OK. Alright? You're OK.", Caleb reassured the blonde succubus. Her eyes remained locked on him as he led her into the group.Caleb did the same with remaining locks on the cages taking same amount of precaution to ensure the girls were at a safe enough distance, so the bullet didn't ricochet and hit someone. Luckily, no one got hit and the last of the prisoners were free. The blue devil girl Camilla defended earlier and a Silver haired succubus in brown boots, jean shorts, and grey sweatshirt. He placed the gun at his side making sure to put on the safety and avoid touching now searing hot barrelCamilla and the freed devils stared at him intently in disbelief some of them huddling close to each other for support and protection. Caleb out over the cluster of multicolored demons all of which wearing metal collar on their necks."There's a van on the side of the building that I think is big enough for everyone. Let me check if the coast is clear.", Caleb explained looking Camilla in the eyes. All of the succubi hung their jaws open slightly at a complete loss for words. He was about to leave when Camila suddenly spoke." Why are you doing this? You got yourself free and had the keys. You could've just left. You have no reason to help us, especially if you could be killed trying do so. So why? What is it that you want out of this human?", she asked with slight venom at the last part. The other devils glared at Caleb awaiting his answer.Caleb was silent for a second. Why was he here, really? What did he want? Perhaps this was just to justify himself so could say he did his best to help instead of running away like the coward he was.After a second of silence Caleb let out a sigh and uttered in a somber tone, " I don't know. I really don't know. I just...couldn't do that I guess. I don't have much of a reason or clear motivation. Maybe it's because of my policy of never turning away anyone if I can help them. Maybe it's my natural male instinct to protect women. Maybe it's my conscience getting to me. Maybe I'm stupid and impulsive. Maybe something about African slavery. Don't jump a gift horse in the mouth. But one thing is for sure: I've decided I'm going to help you girls even if it may cost me my life. "Camilla and the others were stunned at his proclamation. No words could describe how she and the rest felt so Camilla simply nodded in understanding and he nodded back and walked out through the crash bar doors into a dimly lit corridor leading to the back entrance.Camilla honestly couldn't believe what was happening. As he left, she thought of all the men she had met in her life and none of them had ever looked her like that. The compassion and warmth within his eyes was unfathomable. Not even her own mother looked at her with such kindness. She felt her heart flutter a bit.'What is this man?', Camilla thought holding her hand to her voluptuous suspicion, Camilla-senpai? ", said the blue-skinned devil girl. Camilla her attention to her, "C-Can we trust him? Is...that human really going to save us? ". Camilla eyes widened when she then noticed the other succubi giving a mix of anticipation and uncertainty at her answer. She understood how they felt when it came to trusting humans. Human men especially. Many of the girls had been abused by humans when they were exchange students. However, they needed to feel assurance that they were safe.Camilla knelt, caressing the smaller devil's head, as she flashed her a comforting smile, "There there, pequeña( little one), we'll be okay. All of us. I don't know how, but I think we can trust him, he's not like the others.", she spoke reassuringly as the other devil's expressions softened a bit and felt s bit more at ease. They trusted Camilla and looked up to her as something of an older sister. She was the oldest among them after all. Granted, most of them were around 70 to 80 years old in human years, hell even the blue devil girl was around 65, but their species are known for their lack of physical aging. Consequently, they're mental development is rather slow. Most of them in the room are mentally equivalent to being in late adolescence to early 20s. Camilla's about close to a 30-year-old human woman mentally.Narrator sidenote: 1 devil year = 4 human yearsSuddenly the crash bar door crept open slowly, it got Camilla and the other succubi attention as they prepared for who it was coming though. A jean pant leg stepped through as Camilla let out a sigh of relief that it was only Caleb. He crept slowly opening the door wide enough for them to get though. It didn't help that the door was creaking loudly from slight rust on the hinges and the needed stay on the down low."OK, I don't see them. Come on, hurry.", Caleb urge them gesturing to come though the opening of the door. Camilla guided them through as they each went through one at a time trying their best not to trip on one another or make too much noise, "Stay low and stay quiet". Camilla was the last to come though, just behind the devil twins, she then stopped halfway through door standing in from of Caleb. She was about a foot taller than him and large wings needed to be folded into her back like a cape. She stared down at Caleb for a few seconds trying to get a read on him and he stared back a little confused by her actions. Camila was about to say something but the sound of the door in the far back rattling caught their attention." Ladies first", Caleb said gesturing outside. Camilla awkwardly withdrew herself and went to join the group.*****15 minutes earlier Outside of the Warehouse******Gangster Renalds was standing along with Wick and his subordinate bewildered by the sudden turn of events. Wick's subordinate Mark continued to survey their surroundings looking for any sign of police, MON agents, or anyone around that may have seen who was responsible for this. But, the only people around were a couple of drunken homeless men across the street, doubt they'd be much help.As Renalds continued to inspect the device, particularly his tactical flashlight that he sure he left in the van, Wick came up to him catching his attention."This is a joke, right?", wick said to Renalds his voice calm but laced with contempt. He then took the contraption out of his hands, " Is this how you people do business? Is this your brand of humor you try on all your clients?"." I... we don-", Renalds tried to say something but was cut off."Cuz uhh, let me tell ya.", Wick chuckled slightly as her turned on the fan spinning the bottles as the lights flashed. He admired it for a second before tossing it at the brick wall smashing the entire thing to smithereens. Mark and Renalds were startled a bit by the action, and Mark went up to his boss to help him calm down. " I am NOT a man who plays games. I came here to conduct business and your trying to jerk me around with this shit!"" Hold up now, I don't know nothin' bout this little parlor trick mess over here. And I don't appreciate you breakin' my $72 flashlight.", Renalds retorted pointing to his busted flashlight with the bulb cracked open." I don't give give a fuck about your damn flashlight. It doesn't matter how you slice it somebody around here knows something and is screwing with us. Are you weren't followed?", Wick inquired trying to relax himself enough to rationalize the situation." No...No we weren't. We made extra sure to be discrete about this whole operation. ", Renalds said." What about informants? Anybody you bought from or sold to? Or maybe witnesses at all?", Wick continued."I'm telling you man there ain't nobody who knows about this.", Renalds insisted. He obviously knew the hosts they bought some of the devils from likely wouldn't go to authorities. Gaining their approval by pretending to be an agent from Interspecies Exchange coming to remove a troublesome liminal and giving compensation for expenses was a fool proof plan. The money the hosts received alone was enough to shut their traps. Plus, even if they had some sudden change of heart, telling the feds how you sold your liminal house guest into what is essentially slavery isn't the smartest idea unless they're comfortable with a life sentence. As for witnesses, they were practically in the clear. He had been careful in covering their tracks when conducting business; there was no one who could have seen them at work to suspect them.Well, except for that one black fella that came across after their latina succubus who escaped one of their 'discipline sessions'. But that guy isn't a problem, Fat Bastard took care of him. Right?Gangster Renalds couldn't help but wonder why Fat Bastard hadn't come out by now. Surely, he would've heard that police siren and come running inside. He was brought out of his thoughts when Wick called out to his subordinate."Mark, go get Andy we're leaving.", Wick said making his way over to where their car was parked. Ronald's jaw dropped in fear of losing a high paying client before running up in front of them arms widely extended blocking their path." Whoa, come on man, Mr. Malone no need to-", Renalds stopped when he noticed Wick's (yeah I'm calling him that) face contorting into an intense, vicious scowl that could make Satan piss seven colors of fear. He looked like he was fighting off the urge to tear Renalds in half with his bare hands. Renalds gulped from sheer terror as beads of sweat formed on his forehead. Even Wick's subordinate look visibly frightened. His pupils quivered and his whole body was shaking slightly as if he was having a Vietnam flashback. Clearly, he's seen some shit working for this man. Then Wick spoke once more." I never said I wasn't still in the market for what you're selling. However, this area has been compromised so it would be best that we continue at a later time in a more conspicuous location. In the meantime, I suggest you two get your shit together. ", Wick said his voice smooth yet filled with malice as he walked up to Renalds so they were face-to-face. Renalds opened his mouth to speak but no words would come. He then noticed Wick's cold eyes that had a stillness to them yet behind them was something terrifying waiting to be unleashed. He nodded shakily moving out of their way and firmly putting his hands to his sides." Oh. And there's something you should know about me. There's three things we Malone hate most in this world: People who steal from us, people who lie to us, and people that try to stand in our way.", Wick explained as venom dripped from every word causing Renalds to freeze in anticipation and fear.Wick leered at him finishing in a very sardonic tone, " Never forget that. I don't believe in second chances."Renalds could feel every muscle in his body telling him to get away from this man. And so, he thought of the first excuse he could. Instead he chuckled nervously saying, "Right, yes sir. I...W-we won't. You know what? Speakin' of, let me go and uh...see where old Bill been hidin' at", Renalds finished trying to hide the fear in his voice as he walked away to the other side of the building where the van was parked.Wick then turned to his subordinate Mark with, whom just composed himself enough to listen to what he had to say. Wick gestured over to him to come closer and he lay a hand on his shoulder." Listen, we have a golden opportunity here. The goods they have in there, some of them are rare breeds and would fetch higher prices on our markets. Those imbeciles are gonna slip up far worse than this down the line. Imagine if the feds finally got a scent on this whole liminal trafficking channel. The Malone family would be ruined.", Wick explained before giving an obliquitous smirk, " Why don't we do these boys a favor and alleviate their burden?"Mark nodded in understanding, "Yes, your right boss"." Good, good" Wick gave him a proud pat on his shoulder "And hey, play your cards right and I'll ask Mama Lola give you and Andy some much needed R&R. Maybe throw in a few of those cat girls you been leering at."Mark smiled happily daydreaming of the gorgeous cat girls and drooling slightly at the well-earned fun he'd have. He snapped himself back to reality and chuckled, "Yes Boss, you know you're just too nice sometimes"." I know. Now go get Andy and load up that van back there.", Wick ordered pointing to other side of the building." What about the country boy and his partner? ", Mark inquired.Wick then pulled out and cocked his semiautomatic pistol knowingly, " Who?""Right.", Mark smiled and nodded understandingly.**********15 minutes later 0n the back of warehouse********Caleb, Camilla, and the rest of the succubi were outside in the dark of night with only the light of telephone pole lamp illuminating them. Caleb took the lead guiding the escapees through the dirt covered yard stepping over the planks of lumber and bricks scattered every which way. Camilla took to the rear keeping any stragglers in line. As the group continued, they came upon the trench where Fat Bastard and Wick's lacky Andy were still lying unconscious and tied up. Caleb dismissively glanced at the trench as they passed by it. He saw the van in sight and turned to inform them but noticed they were no longer following him. Instead they had stopped completely looking at something glancing at each other with worried expressions. Caleb moved to the right of the group to get a better view. The red headed twin tail succubus was standing at the edge of the trench looking down at the men; particularly Fat Bastard. Camilla was with her speaking to her and trying to encourage her to continue with the group.She simply stood glaring at the man. As his chest rose and fell, a clear indication that he was still alive. She closed her eyes tightly as the memories of everything he had done to her came flooding in her mind. The memory of his filthy skin grinding against her and his putrid smelling breath. The fear and humiliation she felt knowing she was powerless to such a vulgar, lowly creature. She visibly trembled clenching her sharp fangs and fists until her claws dug into her palms breaking the skin as a little blood began to trickle through her fingers. Her jet black and red tipped wings unfolded. Her anger spiked as a faint dark aura began pulsating around her body."Scarlet, novia(sweetheart) please, relax. It's OK-", Camilla continued speaking to her before Scarlet snarled." No, it isn't. It's never going to be OK. This...Filth. His...FILTH. It won't go away. I WANT IT OFF!", she exclaimed. The other devils including Caleb had their attention her. Caleb nervously surveying their surroundings for fear this girl's outburst will get them all killed. The other succubi wore a mix of worried and doleful expressions." Jes, Scarlet. I know but-", Camilla started before Scarlet cut her off again." But what?! For discords sake he touched Hana.", she exclaimed pointing to the blue devil girl among the group causing the latter to jump slightly. Hana cringed holding her head low in shame as tears trickled down her cheeks and she fell to her knees. The twin succubi went to comfort her.Caleb stepped through the other succubi until he was right in the middle of them, " Ladies, please, we need to stay quiet. If those guys hear us we're all dead.""You shut up!", She snarled at Caleb with blood red glowing eyes. He tensed up putting his palms up defensively."He's right novia. We need to get to the van. I-I know how your feeling but there's a time and place for everything", Camilla implored the irate succubus. Caleb and the other succubi surround her.Scarlet responded by extending her arm facing her still slightly bloody palm towards Fat Bastards unconscious body, " And it's now! I'll take back what it stole!", a black orb of purplish-black energy began to form in front of her hand. Caleb gazed in amazement at his first sight of magic."Scarlet don't." , was what Camilla said before the runes on the metal collar around Scarlets neck began to glow and the black ball of energy receded into nothing as her aura faded. All the while, the collar had a faint purple flow around it as it absorbed her energy. Then black spark of electricity began to pulsate from her body as Scarlet fell to the ground writhing in agony. She choked on her disjointed cries of pain. Camilla rushed to her holding the poor girl in her lap as she continued her spasms. The other succubi surrounded them in utter horror and worry.Caleb came to Camilla's side looking down at the incapacitated Scarlet as Camilla gently stroked her hair over her horns." Oh my God, is she going to be OK? What was that?", Caleb inquired getting Camilla's attention."As I explained before", She began with somber tone gazing at the collars on the other succubi then placing her claw tips on her own, " These collars seal our magic. Our regeneration, flight, spells, and even our natural strength. If we try and use our powers our magic gets absorbed and rebounded against our own bodies. And the more magic we use the more intense the pain."Caleb listened to her explanation feeling regret for probing as he looked down at the injured succubus. His heart sank when he saw Camilla's crestfallen expression as she looked Scarlet then the worried succubi around them.Caleb snapped himself out of his trance remembering they needed to keep moving. He was about to say something before one of the succubi yelped."I-I hear footsteps!", stated the blonde devil maid speaking loud enough for them to hear. Everyone snapped to attention looking at her. Caleb listened but heard nothing. However, for all of the other succubi they focused their enhanced hearing-one of their abilities that wasn't hindered by the collars-on the sound. They were indeed footsteps coming from around the and with it the sound of a familiar voice. Gangster Renalds. Panic sank in." It's that man again!", both devil twins stated simultaneously hugging each other for protection."What do we do? He'll find us.", the silver haired succubus muttered as she joined the back and forth fearful glances of the other succubi.Caleb felt his heart rate skyrocket as his mind began to race. He paced a few times nervously biting his knuckle. He then stopped when he saw Camilla stand up supporting Scarlet who was still a little weak. He noticed the look on her face. It was one of distress but also noticeable determination. The kind of look someone has when their backed into a corner but ready to go out swinging. It was actually...comforting. She wasn't about to quit. So why should he?Caleb inhaled and exhaled twice calming himself enough to think clearly. He then spoke to the just succubi just loud enough for them to hear, " Everyone, listen. Stay calm. I've got an idea."With that, the Camilla and the other succubi turned their attention to Caleb with varying degrees of intrigue.Camilla was the first to speak up, " what do we have to do?"He then rubbed the back of his head unsurely, " Now It'll work. Buuuuut, you're gonna have to bear with some bad company", he said as his gaze drifted to the trench. The succubi followed his gaze and cringed.Camilla sighed regretfully, "Oy Diablos mio"*******Renalds P.O.V.*******Renalds quickly came walking down the dirt driveway cussing up a storm as he got to the van. He opened the driver side door grabbing the pack of cigarettes from the center console and lighting one up. As he savored the taste, he couldn't help but think about what that guy said. He had heard of how bad these Malones are but never imagined something like that terrifying. It's like he was mouse stepping into the den of a lion.He brought his trembling hand into his line of sight; his nerves were shaking to the core. At the same time, he was furious about how that man basically looked down on like a child."Fuckin, high and mighty, scarecrow lookin' motherfucker", Renalds punctuated by kicking the one of the tire followed by erratically punching the air in a fit. After a brief hissy fit, he went to back doors of the van. He noticed a lot of things had been moved around. The boxes of clothes and stuff they bought, even his suit he used to pretend to be an Agent from Exchange Program was now lying on the floor of the van.Did Bill come out to van looking for something? No, everything's so neatly out of place. Too neatly for someone sloppy like Bill. Plus, several objects that are missing from the boxes...were a part of that police light contraption from earlier. Somebody else is here.With that thought in mind he made his way down the granite driveway to the back of the building. As he made his way there he could've sworn he heard a female voice call out causing him to stop and whip around listening. He heard nothing and after second immediately chocking it up to stress getting to him.He soon made it to the back of the warehouse. It was quiet save the sound of crickets chirping in the patches of grass and the buzz emanating from the lamp on the electric pole. He scanned the area stepping over planks of wood. Not a soul."Bill! Bill? Where are ya?", Renalds called out. He was answered with silence. A sense of unease began to creep up on him.Feeling impatient he called out again, " Bill! Come on man we gotta move out. Somebody's on to us!"Still no answer. He continued scanning the area walking around eventually stopping just about 20 feet from the concrete trench.Unbeknownst to him, he was being watched by a crouching figure from behind a forklift. The figures brown eyes followed his every move. Occasionally glancing at the trench to the multiple devil girls that huddled together staying low as to not be noticed. A couple of them made sure to keep a good distance away from the unconscious form of fat bastard and the other guy.Renalds stood there continuing to call out for his partner while the inhabitants of the trench kept their existence to a minimum. Camilla covered both devil twins' mouths with her clawed hands to muffle their yelps whenever he shrieked his partners name."Goddamnit", he muttered to himself in a half-sullen-half-worried tone. He then turned towards the back door hoping to find his partner somewhere in the warehouse.He began making his way to the door but stopped when he heard a strange noise.It was muffled. But was someone screaming and grunting.He listened to the sound and following it until his attention turned to the trench.Inside the trench, Camilla and the other succubi stared in horror as one of Wick's men flailed about trying to free his restraints. He continued his muffled growls and curses while glaring daggers at the girls. The rope gag only managed to muffle most of his screams as his teeth were seen clamping on the outer part and several swears were easy to comprehend.Caleb's heart raced as a nervous sweat built up on his forehead while his heart pounded in his ears. His fears skyrocketed when Renalds began walking slowly to the trench.All of the devils' shudder as their sharp hearing picked the sound of footsteps heading in their direction. Camilla gulped turning her demonic red eyes upwards in anticipation.As the came closer into view, Renalds could just make out something at the bottom of it. At first what he thought was a stack of cement mix began to take on a more humanlike shape. His eyes widened when he realized the person in the pit was his partner Fat Bastard."B-BILL!", He shouted hurriedly rushing over to the trench. He was so focused on the seemingly lifeless body of his partner that he only noticed the still flailing of Wick's lacky after he was standing at the edge of the trench. His eyes then drifted to the other side of the trench where a group of devils were crouched in a pile with Camilla glaring hatefully at him. She touched her partially bandaged thigh, the memory of him slashing her resurfacing.Renalds was utterly baffled by the development before him. As soon as his eyes met Camilla's, he immediately became furious." What are you satans doing out of yer cages?", Renalds said in a low, agitated tone before looking over to the unconscious Fat Bastard then back to the devils focusing on Camilla, "Did you do that to Bill?"The devil twins hugged Camilla tighter as the eyed Renalds then answering back with, "No, but perhaps you've heard the tale of Humpty Dumpty."Renalds snorted a big puff of air from his nostrils but noticing what she said was true. He could see Fat Bastard chest rise and fall slightly. Though it didn't help calm since his inventory just tried to escape. "Get out of that pit, and back in y'all cages. Don't make me tell ya twice now".Camilla and the other succubi were silent for second and didn't move a muscle. They were too afraid to. Camilla looked back at the terrified faces of her fellow succubi with worry before seeing their wide eyed shocked expressions. She looked up to see Renalds pointing a gun aimed right at Camilla's head." I said MOVE", He shouted startling many of them, but Camilla kept her eyes narrowed on him. He then pulled the trigger back taking aim at Camilla., "Maybe you should be an example for the rest of these damn, stinkin devils. Heh kind of a waste, I couldn't give that mouth a test drive myself."Camilla scoffed, "It would've been a short drive."That did for Renalds. He began to pull the trigger...and stopped. He felt something hard press behind the back of his head." This may sound cliché but, is that any way to treat a lady?", Caleb stated mockingly tapping the gun to his head, "Now. Using only your fingertips, place you gun on the ground in front of your feet slowly."Renalds was silent for a second and grit his teeth in frustration as he saw Camilla's 'you lose' smirk. He bent crouched down slowly and begrudgingly did as he was told."Now take three sidesteps to the rights with your arms stretched out in front of you.", Caleb ordered.Renalds did as commanded all the while Caleb made sure not to take the pistol away from his head. When they were a good distance away from, Caleb gave Camilla an 'OK' nod. She returned it and immediately climbed out of trench. The other devils climbed out with the taller ones giving the shorter ones a boost up. When they were all out Camilla told them to get into the van. She picked up Renalds gun and started to join them but turned back to Caleb in slight concern. Caleb turned back to her and mouthed 'go' to her." So... you a cop? Or one of those freaks from Mon?", Renalds inquired looking down at his still unconscious partner and the struggling man. He failed to notice Caleb bringing his leg up with his foot aimed at his rear."Nope", Caleb responded kicking Renalds into the trench with the latter letting out a short scream (imagine Goofy's yell) landing top of Wick's lacky. He groaned feeling the pain of his arms just barely breaking his fall as the snapped out of their sockets from the impact. Wick's lacky was none too pleased either. Renalds turned over on his back looking at Caleb with astonishment and had to blink rapidly to be sure he wasn't seeing a ghost. Caleb then smirked saying, "just a black guy with a gun"." Errgh, guess that mean...I'm talking to a dead man. Because you're dead...when we find you. I seent your driver license.", Renalds growled holding his shoulder as isit tender in the shoulder we're damaged."... please... you're the only deadman around here.", Caleb said before turning and running off to the van while Renalds continued yelling idle threat at him. He knew the photos he sent to Sterling would be enough to track down. Plus, he had fat bastard phone still.Caleb found himself at the van just as Camilla had finished getting the others into the back and with a final word of inspiration shut both doors."They all fit in there ok?", Caleb asked as Camilla whipped around to meet his stare."J-Jes, we had to double up a bit.", Camilla replied looking down a bit feeling a bit uneasy. Caleb noticed this and gave her an assuring Pat on the shoulder jerking her to attention."We're going to make it. Ok?", Caleb stated flashing her the most cheerful grin he could muster.Camilla felt her heart flutter again as a light blush formed on her tan cheeks. She nodded turned away.They went to opposite ends of the van with Caleb driving and Camilla riding shotgun. Caleb turned the ignition and the engine roared to life and the headlights shined brightly illuminating the side of the building.Caleb shift the manual transmission to drive. Luckily, he learned to drive stick from driving his uncle's pickup on errands as a teen."Alright everyone let's-", before Caleb could finish one of the succubi screamed loudly and soon though other followed with panicked mutters. Caleb and Camilla exchanged confused and worried expressions before Camilla noticed in her rear-view mirror and yelp out a 'NO'. Caleb looked in his mirror and his heart stopped.Two men was standing with their guns drawn and was preparing to fire at the tires"GET DOWN!" , Caleb yelled out slamming his foot on the gas causing the dirt to kick up from the tire into their faces forcing them to misfire popping off a couple rounds off the van's roof edge. The van sped out of the front warehouse driveway. The men sending several more shots at the van hitting the side, back doors, one of the back windows, and Camilla rear view mirror. Caleb got the van onto the main street sending a loud screech from the skidding tires.*****Wick's P.O.V.*****Wick's lacky Mark came back and told Wick about the blocked off door of the warehouse. At the same time, Wick discovered all the tires on his car had the let out of them leaving them stranded. Whoever was on to them had methodically planned out everything. For all he knew they could be up against a hitman from a rival family. Not wanting to take any chances, he decided to up his firepower and grabbed his favorite P30L from the trunk along with a few more magazines for extra ammunition.He and his partner stealthily made their way around the back maneuvering passed the overgrown weeds. They made it to the back where they could hear someone screaming. A familiar voice too. It was coming from the concrete trench. They ran over to the trench and as they did, Wick could've sworn he caught a glimpse of something rounding the other side of the building. This thought was interrupted however when he and Mark eyes lay upon the bodies of three men in the trench. One of which was Andy tied up and trying to get free while Renalds groaned over his injured joints.Wick turned to a bewildered Mark and told him to get his cousin out of there. Mark didn't hesitate as he climbed into the ditch pulling out a switchblade and began cutting him free and removing the gag of rope."What happened here?", Wick asked the still groaning Renalds."This...black motherfucker...he knocked out Bill that partner of yours...he even stole all them succubi...taking them for himself. Arghh even busted my damn arms.", Renalds strained out."You know if he's a cop? Or an agent?", Wick inquired feeling a bit worried that a lone person could pull something like that over them."N-no. He's some n***er we had caught trying to help that s**k broad you wanted. We...Bill was supposed to keep him quiet.", Renalds finished pointing to Fat Bastard who was starting to come to.Wick was shocked and immediately felt his blood boil at his explanation. To think one regular guy, a BLACK guy no less, played him like a fool. Him? The second born of the Malone family. Not only making him suffer such humiliation of having to try and run and hide but also stealing thousands of millions of dollars with of goods from right under his nose. No. No, that's not gonna fly. Suddenly the distinctive grumble of an engine alerted Wick and his men as they climbed out of the trench. A red tail light alerted them to the location of the sound on the other side of the building.As soon as Wick's men were out of the trench, he ordered them to stop the van and they ran off in it's direction leaving him alone with Renalds and Fat Bastard. He noticed Fat Bastard groaning as he began to wake up." Aharghhh, er...Mac?", Fat Bastard barely whispered as his vision began clear and as his head pounded, "Whaz-What's...going on?...Why-"Renalds interrupts him with a venomous "BILL! GODDANMITT YOU HAD ONE JOB! ONE!". He then groaned once again through his teeth."What? W-what I do?! what happened!?", Fat Bastard exclaimed while his eyes darted about and tried to move finding his limbs bound together, " How'd we get in here? What happened to me?""You tell me asshole! I send you to get rid of that boy we picked up, next thing, shit hits the fan and he leaves with all the devils.", Renalds exclaimed.As Wick heard Renalds fussing becoming gradually more irritated. Then he heard the sound of multiple gun shots followed by the loud screech of car tires. He pieced together what may have happened and grit his teeth together. Meanwhile, the duke boys down under are pushing his limits.Bill then looked up noticing Wick for the first time and asked, " Hey Mac, who's the guy with the beard?""Hey Bill.", Wick stated plainly before firing off a round from his P30L into Bill's head leaving brain matter and blood splattered on the concrete painting it crimson red, " Bye Bill".Renalds hollered and panicked at the sight of the now totally lifeless body of Fat Bastard. His blood pooling and flowing over onto Renald's hand inciting him to jerk it away screaming at the hand painted with his partners' blood."WHAT THE HELL WRONG WICH YOU?!", Renalds shrieked to the top of his lungs." Simple. Getting rid of a 'huge' liability. ", Wick stated cocking the chamber again, " It's because of you two a huge section of my family's business may come under fire. You two have proved your incompetence after this debacle, now I must clean up your mess.""You! YOU'RE FUCKIN' PSYCHO.", Renalds barked." I'm not called 'The Savage' for nothing. Now tell me what you know about that negro.", Wick inquired.Renalds spat at Wick but it only manages to hit the end if his pant leg before retorting, " KISS MY ASS I AIN'T YOU TELLIN' YOU SH-ARRGHH!", he was cut off from Wick firing a round into his kneecap."I didn't ask for a life story. Name.", Wick demanded pointed the pistol at his other kneecap." Aaagh, ahhh...OK...Caleb. Caleb somethin'"Wick pulled back the trigger, "Caleb what?""I-I-I don't know starts with a 'B' I think. Bissell. Baizel. Bessel or something I don't know.", Renalds cried out in pain.Wick pondered for a second, " I suppose that will do. We have our ways of finding our target. And with that, you have outlived your usefulness. Da svidania""W-WAIT, I-", was the thing Renalds started before the concrete behind him was painted with skull plating and brain matter and his wide jawed face slumped down in the pool of blood of his partner.Wick then placed his gun into the inner pocket of his shirt just as his men had returned to him." Boss, they got away.", Andy stated, "And one them dropped this."He showed Wick a black sandal that had fallen off of one of the succubi. Wick took it and raised an eyebrow curiously before an idea popped into his head."Don't worry, I know how to find them.", Wick said as he took out his phone and dialed a certain number.******Elsewhere******In a large old-fashioned British inspired round library room softly lit by a lamp on a brown, well-crafted mahogany wood desk. There were book shelves encircling the room packed with literature. A large window with burgundy curtains contrasting the darkness with the lights from the city below. In the center of the room, were well crafted wooden chairs around a marble table. Sitting around said table were several well-dressed men all with tense looks on their faces creating a rather menacing atmosphere. They had their eyes centered on an old woman sitting at the desk smoking a Cuban cigar. She had pale skin, grey hair, silver eyes, and deep slash horizontal scar on her right cheek. She wore black pants and deep burgundy shirt under a black jacket with a rose pin on both shoulders. The phone on her desk rang and she answered." Hello", She said in a raspy, deep Russian accent before exhaling a stream of smoke, "Ahh, grandson."Wick explained what happened on the other line. As he did, she grew more and more irritated from what she heard. The men in the room exchanged glances." Yes, grandson. I agree, this is insult onto our family that will not go unpunished.", She said taking another puff of her cigar, "I will send them. Call again when you get there."She hung up the phone putting out her cigar in the ash tray."What is wrong Mama Róse?", said one of the men." My grandson has gotten himself in deep shit.", she replied sardonically before pouring herself a shot of bourbon, " send in the mutt."One the men got up and left out of the room.A couple minutes later he returned with a slightly regretful look on his face as he clenched his bleeding shoulder. Followed behind him was a tall canine liminal with dark black fur, larger bushy tail, vicious claws, and big white fangs. She glared at Mama Róse with fiery eyes, but she was not the least intimidated."I need you to help my grandson find a thief. Bring me his head. You can eat the rest. Hope you like dark meat.", Mama Róse finished with a low snicker.The canine grinned showing off its wicked incisors as the flames on its eyes grew brighter, " It's my favorite. "WN: Looks like old Caleb is in trouble. Hope he and the succubi can get out of this alive. What about Mirabelle, Lyca, and Sterling? Don't worry we'll see what their up to soon.Didn't intend on making this a 3 parter really. Got a bit too creative with how to carry this out and it kinda happened.Tbh, i didn't think i'd finish this before October. Starting to find balance in work and school (Seriously, engineering is no cakewalk but i'm managing well) and with what breaks i have, i use them to write a little. Lucky you.Welp that's all I have to say.As always, PEACE FAM.

VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED.****** July 5th 3:45 A.M.*****A warm Summer night permeated the slightly barren interstate highway with calm atmosphere. However, it was anything but.Barreling down the highway were flashing lights of yellow, red, white, and blue. Two police cars in front and an ICEP ( I know, took me long enough to use the acronym) transport van in between MON task force following closely behind. Agent Sterling was driving said transport van. He was dressed in his own variant of MON body armor where, instead of standard yellow, his was jet black with lines of silver. After informing the police precinct and MON about the situation, it wasn't long before they were able to trace Caleb's whereabouts by tracing the signal from the phone he used to contact Sterling. The images of the license plates he sent will help the police in making their arrests.Beside Sterling was Lyca who sat up on her knees in the seat with her head partially out of the window. She stared intensely with her night vision giving her eyed a bright golden glow and a clear view of everything a mile ahead of them. She fidgeted and shuffled in her seat from both anticipation of her Chiefs fate and from sitting in a cramped van for a full hour. She didn't like riding in automobiles for too long. Why humans would subject themselves to being confined to a small space for an indefinite amount of time on top of restraining their bodies to chair with belts she'll never understand.Behind them was a small window to the back of the van.The back was partially lit by four LED lamps on the roof. There stood Mirabelle. She had enough space it mostly empty back there save for a duffel bag filled with supplies. There she stood as the light bathed over her giving her purple fur a shimmering glow. Her wispy tail flickered slowly giving an eerie presence to shadowy area behind her She had her trembling hands clasped pressed to large bosom with her eyes tightly closed as she whispered under her breath.It sounded something like 'Praise to the divine Oneiori, kin of Hypnos, antecessors of Nyx. I beseech thee to grant your protection over my love. My Caleb. Guide thy child of man and see to his safety. Please lead him back to us. Please'.Lyca's ear twitched at the last part and quickly wiped a forming tear away still focusing her sights ahead.Sterling glanced back for a second as Mirabelle continued her prayer. She had been praying ever since they first left. His heart sank for the worried centaur. He could have simply made the them stay at Caleb's residence, it could be very dangerous. However, they (especially Lyca) managed to wear him down and ended up bringing them. Of course, they did have plenty of protection from MON and the police. But he couldn't shake the feeling in his stomach that things were only going to get worse from here.They began to pass through a small town with many of the stores still closed and the homes of people who no doubt were awakened by the sirens.Suddenly Lyca jerked her head slightly when she caught whiff of a familiar scent. She inhaled a couple more times to make sure and smiled hopefully."Chief! I smell Chief!", Lyca chanted wagging her tail.Mirabelle stopped praying as she and Sterling turned their attention to the wolf girl with her head hanging out the window.With hopeful eyes Mirabelle inquired, "What? Lyca are you positive?!"Lyca turned to give her a supportive, toothy grin, "This nose don't lie! His scent is unmistakable."Sterling gave Lyca an understanding nod and said, "Alright, you two remember stay close. We're going to make sure nothing happens to your host family.", before focusing back to the road.They arrived at the location of the warehouse some 15 minutes later. Two other police cars were already waiting for them on the premises.They had the street blocked off in front of the driveway as flashes of blue, white, and red lights illuminated the area. The MON vans pulled ahead of Sterling's joining the officers and parking adjacent to the brick wall along the entrance with four armed agents clad in yellow body armor ready on standby. Sterling was guided by a female police officer to park amidst the other vehicles. Behind her, two liminal MON agents: One female dark elf and the other a male lizardman, moved off to the front of the van. The officer came up to his window."Agent Sterling. ", stated the officer giving a quick salute, " Captain Gibbs requires your attention.""Ok, thank you lieutenant.", Sterling said before stepping out of the vehicle meeting the two liminal agents, "Please keep them out of trouble, especially the she-wolf.""I heard that ya old fart!", Lyca barked hanging her upper half out of the window. The lizard man walks over to her and tries to ease her back into the van, but she wouldn't have it and they began to argue. The dark elf pinched the bridge of her nose shooting a questioning look to Sterling who simply shrugged as he walked off." $16 an hour doesn't pay for this shit", The dark elf muttered while the wolf and lizard kept arguing.Sterling made his was into the entrance driveway noticing an inconspicuous looking black sedan park beside the stone wall. He was greeted by a tall rather hefty, tan-skinned man in grey and blue police attire but with a windbreaker ordained with militaristic ribbons on his chest. He looked to be in his late-50s as he wore police cap that covered his receding hairline and had a burly brown mustache with a line of grey hairs in it."Nice to see ya Gibbs and thank you for coming out at this time.", Sterling shook the man's hand, "Have you and your men scoped out the area already? Was the information Caleb giving us accurate?""That depends on your definition of accuracy Sterling.", He stated in a gruff, deep voice.Sterling was puzzled by his answer, "How do mean sir? What about Caleb and the hostages?!""My squad did a complete sweep of the place. No one is here, no one breathing that is."Sterling was alarmed by his statement, "S-Sir?"Gibbs turned in the direction of the side of the building gesturing for Sterling to follow, "We found a little something around back you're gone want to check out."They took the side of the building with the dirt driveway and found their way to the back of the facility. There Sterling was greeted to the sight of at least three other officers and two people in black suit jackets standing around a trench. Two of the police officers were placing yellow police tape around the perimeter. Sterling and Gibbs arrived on the scene heading over to the trench. they Sterling's jaw dropped at the horrific sight of two dead men lying in pools of their own blood with some splattered on the lower walls. He quickly notices both had bullet holes in different spots on their heads."Agent Sterling", called out a female voice. Sterling and Gibbs turned to see one of the black suits, a short, brunette human woman with pale skin and some freckles on her cheeks, approach them. Her partner, a tall blonde man with blemish less fair skin and blue eyes but his most defining feature was the pair of elongated ears with a little gold earring in one of them, joined her side. His expression was calm but emotionless.Gibbs moved in between Sterling and the suits, " Sterling, this is Detective Hammond and Detective Greenly, they're homicide investigators that were called in from Alabama Bureau of Investigation to look into these guys we found.", He said gesturing between the woman and the elf man"Any information on the victims?", Sterling inquiredDetective Greenly stepped up and pulled out a small notepad from his shirt pocket, " Victims are MacGregor Collins, age 31, and Bill Noland, age 29. Cause of death for both, gunshot to the prefrontal cortex. ""Judging from the type of bullet, the gun was either a Beretta 92 or an HK P30", Detective Hammond stated showing Sterling evidence bag with a bloodied bullet enclosed, " Also, given the entry point on both rounds, the shooter had to have been standing over them while they were in the trench."Sterling pondered for a second before Gibbs inquired, "Which begs the question Sterling? Who was the shooter?"Sterling thought about the statement for a second before his eyes widened in shock, "Sir, I can assure you Mr. Bizzell would not do something like this. He made it clear in his message that there were five individuals. One of them could done it.""We're not making any accusations. We're just considering all possibilities. In scenarios like this, it's not unheard of to resort to drastic means to ensure survival.", Detective Hammond explained.Sterling wanted to continue but begrudgingly held his tongue to avoid putting any further against Caleb. It then the sound of ambulance siren could be heard. As Sterling and the other investigators went over more information, some ambulance workers came down the dirt driveway with stretchers and body bags. A few minutes pass and Sterling, Gibbs, and homicide detectives were finishing their reports while the paramedics the collected the bodies for autopsy. It wasn't until a police officer ran up to them." Sergeant Gibbs, we found something in the garage.", said the young male officer, "It's the vehicle, matching the description of the one from the photo that was sent to the precinct.""Show us.", Gibbs requested and the officer nods and directed to follow.Sterling, Gibbs, and the Homicide detectives followed to the entrance of the garage where another officer had been waiting. The male officer from before opened the latch and slid open the metal doors. There they all stood looking at the black car Wick and his associates used." How are just now seeing this?", Gibbs inquired to the young officer."The area was locked off fairly tight Captain. Even the door through the facility had intentionally jammed at the wedge and it took a while to pry it open."Gibbs and the others pondered for a bit at the statement. Why would the entrances be intentionally blocked from the inside out? Gibbs then took a step closer with his officers in tow as he examined the vehicle being careful not touch it. He examined the license plate."Incense plate matches the one you sent Sterling, even has the Georgia brand on it.", he explained, " and all of the tires are deflated."' It doesn't explain why they would simply abandon a vehicle like this. Why not get rid of it? Unless they were meet someone else and transported the hostages to another location. But what about Caleb? Did they capture him too? Well, if Caleb still had the cellphone he used, they could try locating him.', Sterling contemplated as he stood near the entrance.Detective Hammond and Greenly walked into the garage past Sterling. Hammond then said, "We should take some finger print samples back to forensics lab we should be able to get our suspects."Greenly nodded taking out some plastic gloves and handing a pair to her as well as a thin sheet for finger impressions. Gibbs moved over to side of garage where many of the tools still hung on their racks and his officers continued to survey the room. Hammond realized it was quite dark in the room."Excuse me officer, would you mind turning the lights on?", Hammonds asked one of the officers." Certainly ma'am.", He said as he felt around the walls for something close to a light switch. He found one and quickly flipped it, partially illuminating the room as two of the lights weren't working.It was at this moment that Greenly noticed an unusual sound. It was kind of a buzzing crackle like the dying embers on a campfire. Accompanying it was a metallic, burning smell. He followed the sound to the other side of the car closest to the wall while his partner set up the finger printing equipment. His expression changed to utter terror when his eyes fell upon an electrical socket which had its base wires exposed and were sparking against something like white clay poking out of the car's fuel tank."EVERYONE, GET BA-", was all the elf man could say momentarily alerting everyone before they were all engulfed in a huge ball of flames and the piercing sound of the explosion rang throughout the warehouse filling much of the street. Everyone who was parked near the warehouse spare up in shock as they watched the section of the warehouse lit ablaze. A few police and MON agents ran into the fray to find any survivors.In Sterling's van, Lyca, the Lizardman, and the dark elf wore expressions of disbelief as Mirabelle, wore was badly startled by the sudden noise, stood pressing her hands against the wall of the truck trembling." W... W-w-what...was that?!", Mirabelle barely managing to stutter out. But they were at a loss for words as they watched the fire spread throughout the warehouse becoming a giant bonfire.ElsewhereWick and his two associates were resting at a gas station. Wick was sitting at a table enjoying a cup of coffee while Andy and Mark were sat outside waiting for the help Mama Rõse would send. Mark was puffing a cigar he bought at the counter. As Wick leaned back in his chair taking leisurely sips, he glanced up at the lone cashier behind the counter who was occupying time organizing packs cigarettes.Since Caleb and the devil girls made their little daring escape, Wick and his men were seemingly left stranded, considering Caleb had deflated his car's tires. But, Wick figured it could still of some use and decided to make a little surprise for the cops out of some leftover C4. They had to walk a quarter mile from the warehouse. However, they ran into a little luck when a lone red Chevrolet truck came traveling down the road with it's almost blinding headlights. They got its driver to stop and the rest was history. ...As was the unfortunate driver.Wick was just finishing his coffee when his cohort, Andy, walks in over to Wick."They're here.", He says."Good", Wick comments standing up, crumbling his empty cup placing it in his pocket, and followed Andy outside. They walked to other side of the building where two stylish black Mercedes Benz were parked. Standing around them were Mark and five other men dressed in fine tailored black or grey suit jackets and pants complete with leather shoes. Two had very broad, heavy builds and wore expressions that said they were ready to maim, torture, or kill anyone that wrongs their family. The other two were muscular and gave off a similar menacing aura around them. Only one truly stood out. He was slightly muscular but with a noticeably husky stature.Wick approached him and upon closer inspection, his hair was partially grayed with a receding hairline. He looked around his mid-50s, wore a red shirt under his black suit jacket and above the center of his chest near his windpipe was a rose tattoo. They eyed each other up and down neither side wavering both glaring with challenging eyes. As the gangsters glanced at each other, Wick and the man suddenly burst out laughing and embracing each."Ahaha I nearly made you pee yourself uncle, Nikolai", Wick chuckled as he puts the man's back."Come on nephew, you couldn't scare kitten with that little mug.", Uncle Nikolai chuckled equally heartily.Everyone smiled at their family members before the atmosphere dissipated to get back to business at hand.Nikolai released Wick and gave him a serious before saying, "You have had much trouble tonight cousin. And of course, we are here to right that wrong.", He finished as the other men around the car's nodded in approval."Yes, we have. A man stole what was ours, made fools of us with a cheap, thrift store toy, and made me abandon the new car I purchase.", Wick irritated explained grinding his nails to his palms feeling his rage burning inside him begging to be released"Be at peace, sem'ya (Russian for fam)", Nikolai said placing a hand on Wick shoulder, "We will find this Bissell and send him to hell with our family's symbol stamped on his forehead."Wick looked him in his pale, grey eye and exhaled slowly calming himself before asking, "How do we locate him? We didn't even get a glimpse of him."Nikolai smirked assuredly and answered in a sinister tone, "We have our ways."No sooner he spoke those words, a red glowing crack appeared several feet behind the parked cars physically distorting the space around it at a molecular level. Andy and Mark in exchanged befuddled looks at the anomaly. Wick, Nikolai, and the other men were completely unfazed by the sight.The crack widened into a more oval-ish shape and something steps through, it was a girl carrying a large scythe with a purple staff that ended in a clenched crow-like claw. The blade had jagged edges with a pin and brown color pattern. The girl had light brown hair on her arms, legs, tail, and head. Instead of feet she had large dark brown hooves and in place of hands were large three-digit paws with pink pads. A Baphomet. On her head were two large brown goat horn and long goat ears. She was quite petite, not much in chest region or not at all curvy and wore a similar blue tank top and white short shorts. She wore a somewhat haughty expression as she gazed at the men."Oh, good your all in one place. Guess this'll go quicker for me.", She said with a snobbish voice.Nikolai approached her, "Ah, Ms. Fantina, glad you could join us.""Speak for yourself, some of us need our beauty sleep. You think being this cute happens by accident?", Fantina proclaims making a little pose.Mark leaned in closer to Andy and whispers, "So... I'm lost. How's a goat midget gonna help us?". Wick turned to them giving them look that said, 'shut the fuck up, dumbass'.She must have heard that comment as her eyebrows curled into a vicious scowl. In swift motion, she tapped her staff to the ground twice and a bucket of ice water appeared above him and poured all over his head. He fell to the ground yelping and coughing."PAH AH what the fuck?! Ya damn fre-""DOVOL'NO! (It means enough)", Nikolai interrupted shooting him a disapproving glare. He then cleared his throat and said, "Apologies, he is new and doesn't know much about your partnership with Mama Rose""Tch, whatever just long as he learns some respect.", she grumbles puffing out her cheeks and crossing her arms.Mark got up brushing the rest of the ice cubes off with an angry scowl of his own."Also, where are the others? The...er, demon dogs.", Nikolai inquired."Yeah, hang on a sec.", Fantina says turning to the rippling portal, "HEY, HOW LONG ARE YOU FLEABAGS GONNA STAY OVER THERE?""HEY, YOU'RE THE ONE NOT SAYING IF IT'S OKAY OR NOT!", growled another voice on the other side of the portal.Then, one after another, four large hellhounds (all females) came walking out of the portal before it closed, shrank, and disappeared returning the distorted space back to normal. Their fiery demonic red eyes, large white fangs curled into wicked grins, thick black and red fur one their arms, legs and bushy tailed. They had large black four-digit paws with large red razor-sharp claws. In place of the regular clothes, they wore bones. Human and animal bones. They each had a muscular physique with six pack abs you could grind meat onto and his toned biceps and thighs. They were somewhat curvaceous but quite muscular bodies were barely contained in their bone panties and bras. All of them had blood red metal dog collars ordained in the skulls of prey with a link of chain hanging limply on the lock. Except for the largest of the hounds. Her's was bright silver with small spikes on it. Obviously, she was the leader. They stared at the humans who dared to summon them, and the humans stared back, most were not shaken by their terrifying nature while a few looked like they could piss seven colors of fear."You guys sure picked a boring ass spot", growled the silver-collared hound. The other hounds gave distasteful sneers as they sniffed as the area around them."Apologies, but we needed to be more...clandestine than usual.", Nikolai spoke approaching her ignoring the bared fangs and glares of the other hounds."Whatever. Who do we get to hunt this time?", She said crossing her arms in a defiant stance.Wick walked to his cousin side and stated, " We are hunting one negro human and 10 perhaps 12 devils. Their magic is sealed but bring them back alive. I don't care what you do with the man just leave me the head."A couple of the hellhounds scoffed at him before one of them said, "Pfft, some powerless devils and human? That's it?!""You call that a hunt? We don't even get to eat any of the devils. You expect us to just share ONE human?", Said one of the smaller females who had an 'X' scar on her abs."I agree. This hunt sounds boring just this pedo promoting prima donna to magic you up portal to this guy and YOU take him out.", Silver collar stated a clawed thumb to the Baphomet who's face contorted to one of malice." Because, I NEED to have formed a pact with them. Several of the Malones are contracted to me so I'm able to create portals where ever they are.", Fantina then gripped her scythe as a menacing red aura enveloped her body, " And, make fun of my creed again, and I'll personally spay and neuter you all."Silver Collar bared her fangs emitting a sharp snarl and the other hounds followed suit "Come on goat whore, we'll rip you to shreds.""Now, Now, let's stay focused on our actual targets.", Nikolai interjected focusing their intensity on him, but he remains undeterred. He gestured to Fantina "Fantina darling, thank you once again for lending us your power. I will ensure Mama Rosé rewards your efforts by recruiting more followers to your...uh cause."Fantina's aura dissipated as she grinned cheerfully, "For real? You mean more men will know the superiority of the underdeveloped female form?""Ssssure, why not?"Fantina hugged her scythe to her body wiggling and giggling unsettlingly. A few of the mobster cringe a bit at her action and ideals. The hounds including silver Collar stepped back not wanting to catch any of her crazy."Ahem, now as for you hounds, once this little job is finished you'll have some clients who refuse to pay back what they borrow from us to have fun with."Silver Collar thought for a second then looked to her pack mates. They all nodded with approving smirks. They agreed that when they got jobs like those they ALWAYS had fun ripping those fleeing humans to ribbons. She relented as said, "Alright, fine. But we'll need a scent to go on.""We have something", Wick said gesturing to Andy who reached into his pocket taking out a woman's black sandal. Wick took it and tossed it to the lead hound who caught in her large paw, "It's not his scent, but it fell off one of the devil's that's traveling with him. Find her, you find him.""Works for me", she says before taking a couple whiff of the sandal then passing it around to her comrades. A couple promptly turned their noses upwards catching the scent trail."Got it", stated one of the smaller females."Me too, and they're not far. I'd say 30, sniff sniff, 40 minutes top. That way!", The other female hound stated pointing down the dark road.Nikolai reached into his pocket and took out two small walkie-talkies, "here, contact each other when you found them.", He says handing one to Wick and tossing the other to the lead hound. She stuffed in into her bone bra."Alright guys! Hunting Party!", Silver Collar howled before lunging on all fours with the rest following behind with excited howls. The mobsters watched as the monstrous fire-eyed dogs went pounding down the street as their snarls and barks echoed in the quiet night.He nodded to the Baphomet who then raised her scythe cutting open another portal in space."Jakob, come over here for a moment", Nikolai asked Wick who raised an eyebrow but still did as asked.Fantina stood in front of Wick, she stood about tall enough to reach his waste. She commanded for him to give her his palms. Wick turned to Nikolai who nodded, and he did so. Fantina scythe began to shrink to the size of a small sickle. "Don't move", she's said. She held his palm steady and made a small incision drawing blood. Wick resisted to urge to flinch ensuring it didn't pierce deeper. The blood was absorbed by the blade and the cut vanished. It was replaced with a glowing symbol of goat head with spiral horns before it too vanished leaving his hand bare. She released his hand and he began to examine it."What was that?", Wick inquired opening and closing his fingers."She just added you to contacts. She'll be able to pull you out of trouble when it calls for it.", Nikolai explained with a smirk."As long as he doesn't interrupt my personal time that is.", Fantina chided as scythed expanded back to full size, "just clench your fist and call my name like you mean it. I'll know if you're faking, trust me.""So, with that, we leave the rest to you nephew.", Nikolai says walking toward the portal Fantina close behind.Wick was surprised to hear that and said, "You're not staying?""Nikolai you have all you need nephew, just take your time."Wick thought for a second before responding with, "Yes""Oh, and you will need these.", Nikolai said reaching in his pocket and tossing him some car keys. Wick caught them easily and shot him a grin of satisfaction." Oh, and this. In case the dogs get a bit...difficult.", He said handing Wick a small, thin silver whistle.Nikolai nodded in understanding stepped through the portal with Fantina close behind him. As soon as she was through, the portal collapsed into tiny singularity and disappeared returning the distorted space back to normal.Wick turned and walked over to one of the cars. He gave the men that he was left with a serious look and said, "We're leaving now."The four men that came with Nikolai nodded understandingly and got into the cars without question. Wick took the driver's seat and was joined by Andy in the passenger seat, with Mark and one of the heavily built men in the back. Wick started the ignition, put it in reverse and, pulled out of the parking space. He set it to drive and made his way through the gas station."So... we're not waiting for the hounds to let us know they found them?", Andy inquired as he got on the main highway."You honestly think they'll call? No. They'll just eat the man then go straight for the devils. Untamable beasts are what they are.", Wick answered disparagingly as they drove down the dark street partially lit by their own headlights.Andy gave a puzzled look, " So why are they a part of-""They aren't. They have a deal with the Malone family. Get rid of threats to our business and have the free reign to hunt without MON interference.", Wick continued, "We need to make sure they ONLY hunt the man, not the devils."Andy nodded looking out his door window as they passed a forest lining in thought."Besides, I want to see his face as they rip him apart.", Wick said with a malicious grin looking ahead with equally menacing glare.Andy gulped slightly turning his gaze forward.Both black Mercedes went speeding down the dark streets following the distant howls of the hellhound pack. Wick clutched the wheel in anticipation and rage.You're mine, your worthless bastard, he thought as he put a more pressure on the gas pedal.MeanwhileA large black van was traveling down a dark street with trees lining either side of the road. Caleb stared ahead in the darkness looking for any place they could use for temporary shelter. They passed a couple of houses no long ago, but he decided to not get random people involved in their situation. He kept glancing over at Camilla who had taken the passenger side with her wings folded into her back against the seat. She was gazing out of her door's window in thought cradling arms into her stomach. She was likely still processing everything that happened. Caleb then glanced behind him at the window to the back where the other devil girls sat wondering about their current situation. He turned his attention back to road, failing to notice Camilla now staring at him curiously.It had been a half hour since Caleb had escaped along with Camilla and the other devils. In the panic of being shot at during the escape, Caleb was so shaken 10 minutes driving away aimlessly unable to fully process anything other than getting the hell out of there. Eventually he was calm enough to start coming up with their next move. So far it mostly involved getting far away from those criminals, find a place to find the girls, and contact MON and Sterling using the phone acquired. He didn't know much about Cullman since he had only been there twice in his life, so he just kept on until he found somewhere they rest or get help. Luckily, they had plenty of gas, he thought.He turned his attention back to road, failing to notice Camilla now staring at him curiously. She had been trying to get a read on him ever since he woke up next to her. This human man looked so much like the other mediocre men she's encountered in her life but, at the same time, there was something...more to him. Her heart wanted to believe that at least, but her memories kept reminding her to keep making the same mistakes.5 more minutes of driving and Caleb noticed a bright purple and green light in the distance. He continued onwards and grinned slightly in relief when he realized that it was a neon sign for a roadside motel, 'Dixie Land Trackside' it read. He turned to Camilla who stared at the display before turning to him with questioning eyes."Looks like we can stay there until we can get some help.", Caleb said with an assured grin.Camilla returned a grin of her own before turning to the small window to the back, "Mis amigas we are going to rest at this...uh...", she drifted glancing back to Caleb."Motel.", He uttered"Jes, Motel.", Camilla a bit hesitant turning back around in her seat.The devil girls, who were sitting around different spots on the van floor, exchanged puzzled glances and shrugs. The blue devil girl was the first to speak up, "Um, what's a motel?"Caleb answered before Camilla, "It's a place human use during long trips to rest. They you you're own room with a shower and bed.""Also, a regular spot for humans to breed.", Camilla muttered despondently under her breath. Caleb barely heard it but could make it out. Hana and the other devils heard it clearly and most of them blushed from surprise."Not ALL the time...just sometimes.", Caleb reluctantly admitted as he approached the drive way.The motel itself looked rather plain. The roof had dark blue colored tiles complemented by the bright orange wall of the building. The doors of each room were burgundy colored with brass plated doorknobs and a number placed on the upper center made of metal. The front entrance stood out from the large concrete canopy supported by two columns and large glass doors; all with the same color scheme as the roof and walls." But, at the very least, we can rest here until morn-", Caleb started as he turned into the driveway but was interrupted by a loud clunking sound. He glanced at Camilla who, along with other devil girls, held their ears and groaned from the excruciating pain. Caleb then noticed a bright red glowing symbol on the dashboard and frowned despairingly. Low oil."Arrghhh, w-what the hell is that noise?!", Camila cried out." Please make it stop!", one of the greater devils pleadedCaleb ignored her and tried to concentrate on getting the vehicle through the driveway. The sound grew louder the further in they got, and smoke immediately began billowing from the hood. Accompanying it was a strong smell like burning metal and exhaust. Caleb managed to park the van several feet away from the building. Not necessarily in an actual parking space since they were not far from the driveway. He managed to park in such a manner as to not obstruct anyone else coming and going through. Not that it mattered much as, from he could see there were only about four cars parked at the establishment. He then turned off the engine much to the devil girl's relief, and opened his door stepping out of the van. Camilla unfastened her seat belt, told the other devil girls to stay put while they see what's wrong, before getting out to join Caleb. He proceeded to raise up the hood and outpoured a blinding cloud of smoke causing him to cough and Camilla covered her nose and mouth with her hands. He fanned the smoke away and reach for the oil cap, wincing a couple times from the heat but managing to get it off. He then removed the dipstick and held it up to the light from a nearby lamp on an electric pole. Below the minimum, practically empty, it read. He placed it back along with the top without saying a word."What's wrong with it?", Camilla inquired.He gave stressed sigh and replied, "We ran out of oil. Without it the engine won't run which means the van isn't going anywhere."Camilla felt a jolt of anxiety and unease surge through her. She snapped out of her thoughts when Caleb gestured to her to follow him."And I think I know how it happened too", he said walking to the driver's side, which was littered in bullet holes and abrasions before getting down on all fours. He took out Fat bastard's phone and turned on the flashlight. He shined until he found what he was looking for, "Uh-huh, see this down here?". Camilla the got down on all fours looks under the vehicle at what he was shining the light on. It was a small, round metal pan-shaped part that had a small chunk of it broken off and leaked out drop of black liquid."That's the oil pan. It's was stores and distributes oil to the engine and it's been badly damaged by a stray bullet somehow", Caleb explained before turning off the light and standing up with Camilla following his motions."So, what now?', Camilla inquired"Well...it is a good thing we managed park on the property. I can get just you guys some rooms and try and get in touch with ICEP coordinator.", He stated looking at the motel entrance."O-oh, um, is that really okay? We can just sleep out in the van.", Camilla stated."No, don't be ridiculous it's no trouble. You girls need to rest, and I'll be damned if it's on the floor of broken down van.", Caleb replied bluntly before taking out his wallet and examining the contents, "I just hope they accept discover."Camilla stared at him once again feeling her heart flutter upon making eye contact. She felt her cheeks heat up as she clutched her chest, "G-Gracias, I promise I'll return this kindness.""Kindness doesn't have to be repaid you know. That's why it's called 'kindness'", He replied with a wink before turning and walking to the entrance.Camilla felt a small grin form on her lips as she watched him. Her heart thumped, a bit harder than I than before. Diablos Mia, what is wrong me?! It. happens when ever I... NO, Camilla thought before smacking both of her cheeks to bring herself back to focus. Wishful thinking, that's all. That's all it ever is. She repeated to herself internally. With that, she went to van and opened the doors to inform her friends of their current situation.While that was happening, Caleb walked through the hotel entrance to the reception desk. There was a large bench with burgundy cushions on the far right of the entrance and five other chairs with similar cushions aligned together across from the bench. A small blue plastic table with a stack of assort magazines sat in front of the bench. The blue carpet floors looked in need of a bit of vacuuming and the soft orange walls had a couple spot where the paint was peeling slightly. Next to the reception desk was a drink vending machine. Caleb approached the male receptionist who, upon noticing him, gave a couple more swipes on his phone before placing it to the side. He looked to be around Caleb's height, a bit older as well. He had black curly hair, green eyes, light brown complexion, and black sideburns. He wore grey pants and a blue shirt with the motel name in orange logo. He wore earrings in both ears and one on grey loop on his nose. Behind him were framed documents, health inspector, property license, state state department registry, pictures of guests, etc." What can I do for you?", He spoke with a noticeable Middle Eastern accent."You, uh, wouldn't happen to have any more vacancies. Like, at least two more rooms?", Caleb inquired." Um, I don't know. I check.", He said hitting a few keys on his computer, " Yes, we have many rooms. Many check out yesterday morning. But you are one hour past check in time, it be morning soon, so you must leave...5? Maybe 6. So, I can't check you in.""Ok, I know, it's late and really should've got here earlier but please. My...sisters and I we've been through a lot and we're really, tired. Our ride broke down and we only need to stay long enough to contact someone to pick us up. Pleeeaasse man, just this once?"The man grumbled a bit to himself before his conscience started to eat at him, "Errrrrr, ah, Alright but JUST this once, alright?""Yes, of you thank you so much.", Caleb replied happily"How are you paying?", He askedCaleb took a Cobalt blue card from his wallet, "you take discover?""Yes, and you say you need two rooms...", He trailed typing at his computer before looking back up, "Gonna be 128.56.""Ok", Caleb said plainly as he handed him the card. He swiped it, typed at his computer again."Name?", He asked"Caleb Bizzell. That's B-I-Z-Z-E-L-L."He finished typing in everything then Caleb his card, "you're in rooms 1205 and 1207.""Oh, thank you, I was hoping they'd be close by each other", Caleb grinned sheepishlyHe put up his own grin and handed Caleb two card keys. Caleb turned around to leave but then stopped when a thought came to mind."One more thing. You wouldn't happen to know where we could get some food at this hour?"He thought for a second and said, "Um, Denny's. Yeah, Denny's they open 24 hours. They deliver too, guests here order from them sometimes. They about 5 minutes up the road, they get to you in no time.""Awesome, thanks.", Caleb said before leaving through the door to meet with Camilla. He approached the van so see half them standing around the van and some sitting with the van doors open. Camilla must have let them know what happened as many of them appeared anxious. Camilla was talking to the red head devil, Scarlett, who hung her head with a despondent expression. As Caleb approached, most of their eyes fell on him curiously. Camilla and Scarlett noticed their change in behavior and took notice of Caleb. Scarlett's expression quickly morphed to irritation before looking away with a huff in disgust." Ok guys, I managed to get you guys some rooms.", He grinned holding up the two card keys then looking to motel rooms on the far left of the building numbered in the 1100s "We may be near the back if they start around there.""You managed to get us rooms?", Camilla inquired. The other girls immediately perked up to the notion of sleeping in an actual bed for once."Yep, so if you guys follow me to find them.", Caleb gestured for them to follow. Camilla was to first to go followed by the devils except Scarlett who was a quite hesitant but eventually decided to go with them. The magenta eyed succubus rubbed her bare foot regretting the loss of her other sandal. They trudged their way on the concrete walkway passing door after door and a couple parked cars until they approached the corner leading to the rooms in the 1200s range. As expected the route did in fact take them to the back. The parking spaces were empty, and area was fairly lit by a single light from a telephone pole. There was mid-sized steel fence acting as a barrier between the lot and the dense wooded area filled with tree. The room numbers seemed to end at 1230 since corner to that room only led to the front entrance past a large green garbage container. Caleb managed to locate their rooms.He inserted the card into the 1205 door unlocking it with an audible clink and a green light flash. The door opened revealing a venerable styled room with dark green shag carpeting, light orange painted walls, standard drywall ceiling with classic brown ceiling fan. The furniture consisted of one large brown study desk complete with matching chair and desk lamp, a dark green leather recliner next to the window which sported beige curtains. Next to the study table was an entertainment center where a large Toshiba television set was hooked up. A small black refrigerator with a black microwave sitting on top was position next to the bathroom area. The bathroom consisted of one marble counter sink with all the basic toiletries (towels, soaps, disposable cups, shampoo, etc.) and large glass mirror. Next to the sink was a door to a small room which housed a plain white toilet and shower/bath tub. Lastly, the beds were both queen sized, and each had a brown nightstand with lamp fixed above the wall, a telephone, and a bible. They both had white sheets with orange comforters on top and two large orange pillows sitting at the brown headboards. Caleb stepped back allowing for some of them to come inside curiously inspecting their new surroundings as he unlocked the other room's doors inspecting the inside as well, then closing the door. Overall, both rooms looked rather clean and didn't have any...odd smells. When he came back most of the succubi were all in the first room save for Camilla and Scarlett who just hung near the entrance talking about something. Scarlett looked a bit frustrated as Camilla had worn a somber expression. The devil twins had sprawled out on one of the beds with content smiles. The blonde German succubus, the two greater devils, and Hana had decided to take a load off on the other bed and in the recliner respectively. He tapped Camilla shoulder signaling to follow him inside. She looked back to Scarlett who turned away walking past Caleb with definite scowl. Caleb reached out to ask if she was ok, but Camilla stopped him shaking her head to just leave her be. He relented and stepped inside with Camilla standing beside him and closed the door."Ahem, ok everybody!", Caleb stated loud enough for all of them to hear and they immediately stopped what they were doing and focused on him, " As you can see each room only has two beds, so sleeping arrangements are going to have to be two to a bed. Is that fine with you guys?"One of the devil twins answered first, "That's fine with us!""Yeah Moka and I are used to sharing places to sleep.", The other twin chimed in locking her siblings head in her arm as the both giggled."Um, Sylvia fraulein? Are you fine with sharing?", Blonde German succubus asked the silver haired succubus." Sure Heidi, just don't drool on me OK?", Sylvia answered sneakily."D-Don't be absurd. I do not drool in my like die hund(dog)!", Heidi retorted before crossing her arms pouting.Caleb chuckled slightly and continued, " Alright so...what pairs we got for the other beds? ""I'm fine with any one", said the magenta eyed succubus rubbing her sore bare foot." We could bunk up together Sharon.", said the blonde succubus formerly in a maid outfit. Now she wore a pink t-shirt and cut jean shorts.Camilla noticed Sharon missing a shoe, " Sharon, where is your other sandal?""I don't know. I must have lost it back at the warehouse at some point. It's fine. Sure, Jocelyn, that's no problem.", She repliedCamilla thought for a second before simply letting is pass." Alright that leaves one more bed so...", Caleb interjected.Hana readjusted the recliner and stood up, "Oh, um, Scarlett-san and I can share. Right?", She inquired to Scarlett. The latter's sullen expression loosened into one of contemplation and embarrassment while cradling her arms and wings to her sides.Camilla gently placed a hand on her shoulder and spoke in a caring tone "Novia?"She didn't respond to the gesture for a second before saying, "Yes, that would be fine Hana," then averting her eyes dejectedly.Caleb saw the exchange and felt the tension in the room growing a little too thick. He wanted to say something but bit his tongue to avoid causing them any more stress.Camilla gave her a few supportive pats accompanied by a smile. She walked over to the recliner and plopped stretching all her limbs, including her wings, with a tired yawn, " ~Hmm, I think I'll sleep here. Es muy comfortable~"Caleb smirked at her gesture before announcing to everyone, "Ok now that's settled, bathroom and shower's right there and TV's got cable. I'll just leave you to yourselves for a bit. I have something to take care of.""W-wait, um, where are you going to sleep?", Moka, one of the devil twins, asked causing everyone else to spring up in shocking realization that they'd have to end up sharing a sleeping space with a man. Many of them were too nervous to look at him. Camilla shot up too with a light blush on her cheek. Scarlett simply glared at Caleb with distrusting, almost hateful eyes. All of them awaited his answer."Don't you girls worry about me, you should think about resting. You've all been through a lot tonight and prior to for all I know. So just relax, ok?", Caleb answered warranting stares of intrigue at him."But...what about those men? Won't they come for us?", Heidi asked shaking fearfully at the idea."Don't worry, I sabotaged their only means of transportation and even if they do find a ride there's no way they could find us.", Caleb reassured.Camilla immediately stood up about to ask him something but was interrupted by a knock at the door. Heidi, the twins, and Hana yelped and leapt behind the bed in fear as Scarlett and Camilla immediately stepped away from the door eyeing it cautiously. The knocking continued, and Caleb turned around looking through the peephole."Ahhhh! They found us!", Heidi exclaimed huddling together with Hana and the twins trembling.Camilla spread out her palms bearing her claws in a defensive stance ready to protect her friends."Hello, delivery? A large order for this room.", A male voice spoke slightly muffled by the walls.Caleb perked up with a delighted grin, "Ohh, sweet it's here."Camilla lowered her defenses as Heidi, Hana, and the twins peaked from behind the bed Do-Rei-Mi-style and everyone gave him very puzzled looks as he opened the door.There stood a man with Asian features, black hair under blue cap with the 'Denny's' logo in yellow. He was dressed in Navy blue polo shirt, black pants, and a blue waist-length apron with same logo as the cap. Behind him, a bright yellow moped was parked. There was a large metal basket attached to the seat filled with a large plastic bag loaded with containers, two plastic cup carriers with 9 tall cardboard cups, and a large blue and yellow cardboard container that had handle on top."Hey, I got an order for a 'Caleb and Company'.", He read off his tablet raising an eyebrow at the last part."That's right.", Caleb saidThe man just went with it and took the food out of the basket and began reading out the order, "Ok, we've got 11 America's Dinner cheeseburgers, 2 ceaser salads, 9 large seasoned fries, large red skin mashed potatoes, 9 medium Ice teas and 9 slices lemon meringue pie."At this point, Camilla along with the other succubi we're peering over Caleb from behind."Yep, everything down to the 'T'", Caleb nodded glad that they didn't miss anything.The man chuckled holding the large bag, "You guys must be having the late night muchies. Your grand total is gone be $146.80"Caleb felt his heart stop clenching his credit card. He let out a soft sigh and slowly handed him the card. Well, he's helping folks in need. Credit limits be damned, he thought.As the man was about to swipe the card on his tablets reader, he noticed Hana peering at them. She darted back inside when she made eye contact. He then noticed the other succubi staring at him and asked Caleb, "Oh, sir, are you their host for the interspecies exchange?"Caleb looked back the succubi, "uhh, yes. Yes, I'm their host.""We have a 40% discount for host families who's orders total over $40.", he said typing something on his tablet, "Alright, your total will then be $88.35"Caleb perked up a bit. It was still kind of pricey, but more manageable."Can I see some proof of membership?"Caleb took an ICEP host I.D. card out of his wallet and handed it to him. He verified it, swiped Caleb's credit card, then handed both back to him. He then gave Caleb the cardboard container and plastic bag, then each individual beverage carrier, finally the receipt then proceeded to leave on his moped. Caleb took to food inside to the awaiting succubi.They got a whiff of the scent wafting from the contents in the bag as he sat it and the cardboard container down on the table. A few of their stomachs growled as they bit their lips hungrily."You're gonna love this. Their burgers are the freakin best!", Caleb stated as he took out a small blue and yellow cardboard box and handed it to Camilla."You...bought all of this for us?", Camilla asked totally surprised by the gesture."Well yeah, you guys must be hungry right?", He answered going the bag lining up the other burgers with the packs of fries.Camilla inspected the box for a second before opening it up revealing a brioche bun with beef, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, and All-American sauce. Her mouth watered as she picked it up and took a bite. Immediately, her taste buds were hit with multiple pops of flavors. The thick, juiciness of the meat, the creamy melted cheese, the sweet crispy onions, all coupled by the mildly spicy All-American sauce. She hummed blissfully as she continued chewing savoring every bite."Mi Oscuridad (My Darkness!), this is fantastica!", Camilla happily exclaimed"See, told ya. Alrighty, who's hungry?", Caleb chuckled hand her a pack of seasoned fries and sweet tea which she eagerly accepted."Oh, me!", Moka cheered bouncing over to Caleb"Me too!", Her sister chimed in following her motionCaleb handed them each a burger, a pack of seasoned fries, and a sweet iced tea."Thank you!", Both statedCaleb handed a burger, fries, and an ice tea to Sharon, Hiedi, Sylvia, and Hana."Thanks a bunch", Sharon grinned"V-Veilen Danke", Hiedi shyly spoke"Thank you so much", Sylvia said"Thanks. I love cheeseburgers!", Jocelyn stated."Thank you, you're so nice.", Hana said contently.All of them happily gobbled up the food like it was the first decent meal they've had in weeks. ...Maybe it was.Caleb then approached Scarlett who was leaning against the wall. She glanced at him as he approached her with a burger and fries in hand then turned her gaze to the wall next to her. The other succubi stared at them."Heyyy, I have delectable cheeseburger with your name on it", Caleb joked attempting to lighten the mood."I'm not hungry.", She grumbled before her stomach growled loudly and she blushed clenching her teeth in frustration."Heh, sure doesn't sound like it to m-", he started before she interrupted him."WELL GET YOUR EARS CHECKED.", She hissed glaring with demonic red eyes. Camilla was about to get up to say something but Caleb shot her a look and gestured for her to not get involved."You must not like burgers? That's cool, not everyone likes beef. Maybe you'd like chicken.", Caleb said"Argh, for your information I don't eat MEAT period. I'm vegetarian!", She stated becoming irritated by him, "Now just leave me alone"Many of the other succubi stopped eating and looked at Scarlett sadly. Camilla was about to say something, but Caleb spoke up again."Oh, if that's the case...", He trailed off walking to the table where 2 more burger trays sat and replaced one with one in his hand then walked back to Scarlett, "Why not have a veggie burger?"Scarlett was taken aback by his statement and her stern expression loosened to one of surprise."I figured some of you may not like meat so just got the large salads and a couple veggie burgers to be safe.", He stated in a matter of fact tone."...uh, you...", Scarlett muttered unable to find the right words." Honestly, I got one for myself too. Trying to eat a little healthier you know", he saidScarlett blinked at the statement and just took the sandwich and fries. She tried to avoid eye contact by still faced him, "...er, T-Thank you.""No problem."Camilla and the others were astounded by the exchange and gazed at the young man who managed to curb the demoness's anger for the moment.Caleb then turned, picked up a burger, and made his way for the door only to be stopped by Hana who ran up to him grabbing his wrist."Wait, Mr. Human, aren't you going to eat with us too?", Hana inquired looking up with her bright gold and black orbs."It's fine, I said I still had to take care of something. Also, my name's Caleb.", he said giving her a pat on her head."Caleb-kun. Ok, got it.", Hana giggled"Heh, just Caleb is fine. Oh, and Camilla?"Camilla placed the rest of her food to the side giving him her attention, "S-Si?""I'm giving you the card keys.", He said placing both cards in her hands, "This one's for 1205 that one's 1207. Insert them vertically in the lock to open the door."Camilla examined the cards and nodded."Alright, if you need me for anything I'll be outside in the van", he said as he opened to door only for it to be forced closed by a slender arm. It was Camilla standing behind him with a stern look."Aha! You intended from the start on sleeping out in that broken-down metal box.", She stated."Yup, now if you-"Sharon spoke up next, "Hey, that's not right. You've done so much for us.""Yeah, it'll be a little awkward, but we can make it work.", Julia addedCaleb shook his head easily reopening the door much to Camilla annoyance from not being able to utilize her full physical strength, "Look, it's fine alright. You girls just worry about yourselves right now. Okay?"Before any of them could provide a rebuttal, he had already closed the door behind him and began walking to the front entrance. He took out Fat bastard's phone and began to dial Sterling's number.Back in the hotel, most of the succubi had finished up their meal, save for Scarlett and Camilla who were both lost in thought."Hey, what do you guys think of him?", Jocelyn asked causing everyone to pause for a second, even snapping Scarlett and Camilla from their thoughts." Well I think he's really nice.", Hana said with a smile."Yeah, getting us beds to sleep AND awesome food? He's ok in my book.", Sharon agreed."I don't know. He seems a bit odd. It could be a ploy to earn our trust.", Hiedi refuted"He saved us, so he'll eventually think he's entitled to a reward like...well...", Julia added making a few of them blush."But then again, he seemed adamant about not eating with us or sleeping in the same room. Is he afraid of us? Maybe he's trying to give us space?", Heidi added in an uncertain tone before looking to Camilla, "What do think Camilla Fraulein?"Camilla sipped some of her tea as she thought for a second before setting it down, " I'm not sure. He seems like every other human man but there's something more to him. I don't sense any malicious intent or ulterior motives from him. I even sense genuine concern and care from him."Many of them grinned in relief at her answer. They knew decades of experience made Camilla a great judge of character. Scarlett looked over her shoulder then back to her half-eaten veggie burger remember the look he gave her. It was one of patience and understanding. She felt a small grin form on her lips.********Meanwhile***********The once quiet street in Cullman was filled with bright flashes made by the fire trucks and voices of fire fighters desperately trying to put out the inferno and keep from spreading filled the area of the former warehouse. Among the chaos were paramedics quickly getting six stretchers out to the ambulance staff. MON forces had to make space for them to accommodate the injured. Sterling sat on one of the ambulance benches receiving treatment for 2nd degree burns on his right arm and having a few pieces of metal shrapnel taken out of his right shoulder. He winced slightly as the male paramedic finally finished taking the last piece out, cleaning it, and putting compression bandages on the wounds. Sterling exhaled as he looked over at the unconscious elf detective in one of the stretchers with a breathing mask on his face and his female partner sitting in the ambulance waiting for him. Her left arm had been broken and had her torso bandage after a large piece of shrapnel grazed her side; a couple inches deeper and it would have punctured her kidney. As the paramedic finished applying an antiseptic salve to his burns, he left to get some bandages. Sterling closed his eyes ruminating on everything that happened.They were careless. They should've known it was some kind of trap. He'd be dead if it weren't for Detective Greenly's lightning fast reflexes in creating a magic barrier that shielded not only himself, but he and Detective Hammond and his specially modified MON armor. Unfortunately, a powerful blast from such a close range meant the barrier could only protect them so much. What's more, it was so spur of the moment the he could only generate enough energy to cover a seven-foot radius. Sadly, Gibbs and the other two officers were just a couple feet out of range.Sterling lugubriously stared at a group of men pushing a stretcher with a large grey body bag containing the charred remains of former Captain Gibbs. He spiritlessly reached into his shirt pocket near his chest and pulled out a metal flask of bourbon. A small gift he received from Gibbs after passing basic training. As he was about to open it, he noticed a piece of shrapnel sticking out of front. He clutched the flask fervently before unscrewing the top and guzzling down the strong beverage warranting a strong exhale upon feeling his nerves loosen up."Gramps!", A familiar voice called out. Sterling instantly knew who it was and let out another sighHe looked up to see Lyca standing there with a very concerned expression with her tail u between her legs staring at his injuries. She slowly took a step forward, "W-W-What happened?! Are you gonna be Ok?!""Bad judgement, don't worry I've been through worse. More importantly why are you-", before Sterling could finish his question another voice called out."THERE you are! Don't go off by yourself!", The Lizardman MON agent angrily stated walking to Lyca grabbing her by the shoulder. Lyca wrestled out of his grip and the two stared each other down."I remember your orders were NOT to let her out of the van", Sterling said very irritated and regretting bringing her and Mirabelle.The Lizardman broke the stare and turned to Sterling shocked when he noticed how banged up he was, "Uh, apologies sir, after that explosion she just took off and I had to go after her.""Hey, you tried go see what was happening too. Your partner had to stop you. Talk about neglecting your orders", Lyca spat crossing her arms. He shot an angry scowl at her to which she stuck out her tongue.Sterling took another sip of bourbon. He really did not need this right now."She is right you know. You could get written up for this.", The dark elf scoldedLyca and Lizardman turned to see the dark elf approaching them with two other human Mon agents and Mirabelle. Sterling nearly choked on his bourbon at the realization that Mirabelle would see him in the state he's in.Lizardman turned to his partner, "And just who's side are YOU on?! Besides you let her leave the van", he said pointing a claw to Mirabelle making the latter tense up nervously."I didn't LET her leave. I had to move the van to make space for the paramedics and the only available space was outside our area of operation, so I brought her with me with these two as extra back up", the dark elf explained gesturing to the two mon agents who both nodded.It was at that time Mirabelle saw Sterling. Her eyes widened in complete shock seeing her coordinator with such severe burns. Sterling noticed her expression and felt immediate shame for allowing someone like her to see that."S-Sterling...", Mirabelle shakily uttered covering her mouth to hide her quivering lips. Lyca, Lizardman and the dark elf noticed her visibly quivering.Sterling met her eyes and forced a smile, "It's alright, Mirabelle. It's just a little burn, some ointment and few pain killers and I'll be good to go."Mirabelle nodded slowly then looked away dejectedly before the dark elf came to her side to comfort her leading her away from the morose sight. Lyca reached out to follow her but was stopped by the Lizardman who gave her a look that said, "She's going to be alright."They didn't get very far before an officer for Cullman county came running through the small crowd, "Agent Sterling! We just received urgent information!""What is it?", Sterling asked wanting to hear some good news right now."We managed to locate the kidnap victim.", he stated.Sterling sat up straight giving his full attention. Lyca perked up excitedly as Mirabelle stopped dead in tracks turning hear as well."Did your department finally manage to pick up the signal on that phone he used?", Sterling inquired as the paramedic came back motioning for him to sit still while his wrapped the arm in gauze."Well yes, but the thing is, the victim is the one who gave us his location.", The officer explained much to Sterling's surprise but nodded as the officer continued."He's at the Dixie Land Trackside along with the liminal hostages. It about 10 miles from our current location."Sterling, Lyca, and Mirabelle all breathed a sigh of relief at the idea that this ordeal could finally be over soon. Lyca suddenly began sniffing the air and stopped when her ear stood erect. Sterling was about to continue before the officer continued again."There's... something else sir.", He started, "That license plate the victim matches one on a vehicle seen in locations of drug trafficking. And, we have reason to believe that car's owner was a member of the Malone Family."Sterling felt a cold sweat build up on his forehead. Why the hell did it have been the Malones, he thought. He looked up the officer and said in very serious tone, " I need you to tell them we have to dispatch to that location immediately! We don't have time to lose!"The officer gave a quick 'understood sir' and was about to go before Sterling continued, " And get me a squad car, I'm not fit to drive now.", he stated reference his banged-up arm and the underlying truth that he was little bit intoxicated.The officer left, leaving Sterling surrounded by the confused stares of the four liminal close by. When the paramedic finished wrapping up Sterling's arm, Sterling thanked him and asked to be left alone. He stood almost stumbling slightly but managing to steady himself. The other Mon admired his determination."I need you to get them to a safe location right now.", He said in an authoritative voice."Yes sir, right away.", The dark elf obeyed as she was joined by the Lizardman and the two human Mon agents."S-Sterling, what's happening?", Mirabelle asked becoming even more worried." The situation has taken a drastic turn and now it's become too dangerous for either of you.", He answered plainly as he tried to move past them."B-But dear is going to Ok right?", Mirabelle inquired"Yeah, we need some answers here.", Lyca added.Before either of them got an answer, the dark elf, the lizardman and of the humans began pulling them away as Sterling walked by. Mirabelle and Lyca struggled to get out of their hold as they continued questioning Sterling who seemed to ignore them."It's alright, we have everything under control.", Said the dark elf attempting to calm them."That is deer shit and you know it!", Lyca spat as the Lizardman continued to box her in. The dark elf seemed unfazed by her comment but went silent.Mirabelle turned around with pleading, teary eyes, "STERLING, please just tell me. Is Caleb's life still in danger?!". The Mon agents stopped moving, even Lyca was surprised by her outburst. Sterling stood silent for a few seconds."Mirabelle, we'll do all we can.", He said before walking again. Mirabelle stared at him in uttered shock at his superficial answer. Lyca clutched her fists emitting a low growl; she had reached the end of her patience.Before anyone could react, Lyca shoved the Lizardman away making a squatting motion and lunged herself upwards flying overhead before landing in front of Sterling with enough force to crack to concrete. Mirabelle and the Mon agents gazed in astonishment by the feat as Lyca through her arms up blocking Sterling's path glaring at him intensely. Sterling stared at her dismissively without a hint a being intimidated."Lyca, kindly step aside.", Sterling stated never unflinchingly."Not until you tell us the truth! What did you mean by drastic turn?", Lyca growledSterling stared at her then turned around to see the Mon agents allowing Mirabelle space to come closer. She her pleading purple eyes still glowing as the tear dried. He noticed how behind them was something else. Conviction?He let out a deep sigh, "It's possible is now being hunted by a group of criminals called the Malone Family; a syndicate made up of the American Mafia members and Vore V Zakone black market traders. They've been operating across South East and Central U.S. and have been slowly bringing their activity to Alabama. We still haven't been able to find a reliable lead to their trade channels. ", Sterling paused for a second mulling over something."What does that have to do with-", Mirabelle started but Sterling continued."They're known to be extremely vicious even more so than their sister group in the Northeast. Witnesses, borrowers, and even other dealers have all killed or worse in very brutal fashions. There's even cases of them attacking host families and selling liminal on the black market. What's more, there's even speculation that liminal are involved in their crimes as we've found people with all manner teeth and claw marks on their mangled or dismembered bodies. ", he finished sullenly.Mirabelle and Lyca were horrified beyond belief; both unable process anything but the image of their host butchered in cold blood." Is that what you wanted to hear? If not, I'm sorry but that's the situation we're in.", Sterling said with a hint of remorse.Mirabelle entire body shook as she converted her mouth and questioned under her breath, "Why? Why is this happening? Why?"Lyca clutched her fists shaking with fear and anger.The officer from before returned."Agent Sterling, we have a problem?", he stated causing Sterling and everyone else to stare at him inquisitively."Patrol found a body of an elderly man in a highway ditch just 1 mile from here. The emergency vehicles have the section blocked off and will take a half hour before our cars can move out."Sterling and the others couldn't believe what they were hearing."No, nonono, that's way too long. Every second we're here, the victim and the hostages are in more danger.", Sterling stated feeling the situation." We're sorry sir, we're moving as quickly as we can.", he stated a bit nervous at the growling werewolf.Sterling pinched the bridge of his nose in irritation before Lyca exploded."AHHHHH! This is ridiculous! Screw it, I'm done waiting around.", Lyca shouted startling everyone before leaping on top of the ambulance sniff the air for the faintest trail of Caleb's scent. She found it."Lyca! Get down from there now!", Sterling commanded as Mon agents kept their eyes on her. The dark elf pulls out a sidearm with tranquilizers ready on his command."No! If you guys can't make it to chief in time, I'm going myself. I have his scent trail and way faster than your dumb cars!", She shot back."Listen wolf girl, If you even THINK about going on your own you WILL be charged breaking U.S. Exchange laws and face deportation.", The Lizardman stated as Mirabelle froze in despair at the idea of losing Lyca."Don't you get it?! I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO ME! I CARE ABOUT CALEB!", Lyca shouted as her eyes became a little watery. She then exhaled slowly calming herself a bit, "Please, I'll be fine just keep Mirabelle safe."Mirabelle's eyes widened at her last statement before Lyca leapt off the ambulance landing in the street before taking off down the dark road full speed on all fours.The Lizardman stared at the spot Lyca once stood both stunned and admiring her resolve. He grinned and said, "Wow, that girl has got moxie!"Sterling angrily moved in from of him, "That GIRL has got undiagnosed attention deficit hyperactive disorder! Now please have your squad go after her!""Understood sir. Come here, you.", The elf girl said as she grabbed the Lizardman by the ear tugging him away as he yelped in pain all while the other two agents guided Mirabelle to come with them.Mirabelle held her arms dejectedly. She wanted to go with Lyca to rescue Caleb. She did with all her heart. But her body...it just wouldn't move. All she could do was follow the Mon agents said. She felt helpless. Useless. It hurt her to the coreSterling hung his head in fatigue attempting to massage a forming migraine, "God...fucking dammit."*******Motel*********Caleb sat at the open back doors of the van dangling his feet lazily over the edge. He looked up to the night sky listening to the sound of crickets chirping in the distance then down to the phone in his hand. It had been 5 minutes since he called 911 and gave him their location. Though it surprises him a little too hear from the person on another end say he's labled as a missing person. It made him feel better knowing help would be on the way. They just needed to wait a little longer.The van floor had all the remaining clothing from the boxes piled into a makeshift bedding. He scrolled through fast bastard's phone plaintively eating the rest of his burger. He found a lot of odd phone numbers and contacts. Also, a lot of pictures ranging from ordinary internet memes and some more... disturbing one's of liminal girls of various species in suggestive poses and outfits. He finished his meal, discarding the box and paper somewhere in the front seats then decided to put the phone down for a while in sleep mode. It was at 45% so he needed to conserve power.He pulled in his legs preparing to close the door. Not like he was going to sleep, the head injury from earlier would put him in a coma. His thoughts drifted to Mirabelle and Lyca and how if they were ok, especially Mirabelle, he really hated to make her worry so much. He remorsefully sighed and reached for the door, he heard a sound. Footsteps, like someone was slowly creeping up around the van. Now, any rational person would simply call out to them for a response, but tonight's events have made Caleb a bit paranoid, so his instinct told him to reach for the sidearm underneath the maid dress.He gulped while his trembling fingers fingers hovered over the firearm."Señor Caleb?", came the voice of Camilla before peeking her head over one of the doors. Caleb exhaled slowly pushing the gun back and covering it up."Oh, Camilla, it's you. What's up? Are the girls ok?", Caleb uttered slightly embarrassed by his paranoia."No, they are fine. I just wanted to see if were really going resign to sleeping like la persona sin hogar (a homeless person), She smiled before noticing the pile of clothes spread out over the van, "It seems I wasn't far off.""Yeah well, do watcha gotta do. I've slept on couches way less comfortable than this.", He replied"You know, you could've slept in the same room as us. You bought them after all", she noted"True, but I wanted to give you guys space. You all likely been through a lot from how you all reacted towards me and I didn't want to cause you guys anymore stress.", Caleb explained warranting a surprise stare from Camilla. He was really that considerate towards them? She thought.Caleb suddenly realized, "Hey, do you still have the card keys? What if one of girls gets locked out?""It's fine. I gave one to Heidi for her group's room and another to Scarlet for hers. They're young but pretty responsible.", Camilla said sitting down next to him. He scooted back allowing her more space. They both sat leaning their back on opposite ends of the van walls; Camilla limply dangled her right leg off the edge of the door."Yeah...", Caleb trailed, "is she going to be ok? Scarlett, I mean."Camilla paused for a moment, "I cannot pretend I know the answer to that señor. She has...suffered. That man used her like his personal toy.", She finished distastefully scowling at the meer thought of it."Hmph, well now I wish I did kill him.", Caleb stated bitterly surprising Camilla, "Or at least slammed a brick hard into his crotch"Camilla was wide-eyed at his comment before clearing her throat, "You...are a strange man.""I get that a lot", Caleb shrugged half-heartedly before saying, "The other girls seem to really respect you a lot.""Jes, we've been together so long they just started seeing me as an older sister figure. Personally, I've never been able to see it.", she grinned slightly."How long have you guys been together?", Caleb inquired.Her smiled faded into a somber expression as Caleb started to wish he'd kept his mouth shut, "I'm not sure. Weeks, months even? The days seemed to blur together. After I was captured by traffickers in mi Tierra natal (my homeland), I was sold to a dealer across the border and eventually passed along to here. We've been moved around so much I stopped keeping track of how long it's been.""You were captured? How?", Caleb asked"Well... actually my...ex-husband sold me to them. I was of no use to him, so he threw me out for someone else.", Camilla spoke coldly."What?! Why the hell did he do that?!"Camilla went silent for a second, "because...because I couldn't bare him any children. I failed him three times since I was with him."Caleb listened to her, his gut wrenching at what he was hearing. He saw her extremely hurt expression and simply nodded in understanding. She frowned bitterly and continued."There were originally more of us ju know. I've seen mi amigos ripped away, abused, humiliated, and sold as sex slaves. Others like Heidi and Hana that joined la intercambiar programa (the exchange program) had their rights sold by the very hosts assigned to ensure their safety. The human men we've met have hurt us in ways you could only imagine. Over time we learned that the only ones we could trust, were each other.", She finished pulling her knees into her chest sullenly. Caleb's heart sank when he noticed she looked just like how she was when they were trapped in the warehouse cages. Now that he thought about, she kind of reminded him of Mirabelle."I-I'm so sorry. Camilla...", Caleb said a bit hesitant unsure of what to say to make her feel better.His heart sank to an abyss when she looked at him with bright red saddened eyes, "Tell me, why do humans hate succubi so much? You see us as just dangerous creatures of hell deserving of scorn and ridicule. Worthless beings that contribute nothing but pain and frustration. To your kind, our only good talent is being tools for pleasure. We may be mischievous deviants but that is in our nature, like araña(spider) spinning web or pajaro(bird) building nest. Some of us may have extremely powerful magic but we rarely use it to harm or kill someone. And jes, there are members of our people that steal life energy but that's only because...well...", She trailed off somewhat embarrassed to say as Caleb got up and sat next to her, "All that considered, we are still people.2 Right?""Camilla, humans will always have preconceived notions about other people. For succubi, I'm sure that hatred stems from religious beliefs teaching that devils and demons are never to be trusted and to be driven out by any means.", Caleb said"Jes, I am aware señor. I've been around long enough to know that.", She spoke sadly"But, don't lose out just yet. Things change. There are plenty of humans who accept devils. Heck, both species are alike in some ways. We're both mischievous pranksters at times, we both have a lot of negative stigmas attached to our species, and I'm not making you feel better, aren't I?", He finished unenthusiastically."Not much señor.", Camilla said plainly."I guess I'm just trying to say...it takes trust to do away with hatred. You just have to be willing do so.", Caleb said."I've trusted plenty in the past señor and have been hurt terribly; by humans and incubi alike. Besides, I haven't met any humans willing to put faith in me or any other devil", Camilla stated bitterly."Well... I trust you and to prove it I have a little surprise.", Caleb said causing Camilla to raise an eyebrow. He crawled over to the van and uncovered a small hatch in the floor he discovered not long ago and pulled out a small pair of bolt cutters.Camilla cocked her head in confusion, "bolt cutters señor?""Yep, gonna remove that collar of yours and restore your magic power or whatever. You know, just to help you get back most of your independence.", Caleb stated, "Now turn around please."Camilla grinned at him sadly, "That's a...nice gesture Señor Caleb but, as much as I hate to admit, these collars are imbued with powerful angel magic that even a high level demon like myself cannot break. I doubt a simple tool like that will do anything. Plus, you humans have such poor resistance to magic, I don't want you to get hurt if it rebounds against you and tears your mind apart.""Come on", Caleb said crouching beside her, "Never know until you try. I'm pretty tough."Camilla gave him another look before reluctantly turning her back to him folding down hers wings to get better view of her neck, "I-If your body feels weird at all, please step away. Ok seño-"Before she could finish her sentence, she heard a snapping sound followed something small and hard land on the van floor. Her eyes widened when she realized it was the tiny lock holding the links to her collar. Following that, she felt the collar unhook from around her neck and fall to the ground in front of her feet as the glowing ruins faded away. She stared dumbfounded at the object. She looked at her hands immediately seeing and feeling her magical energy flow through her. The wound on her wing, the cuts on her body, and the bullet wound had begun repairing themselves through her healing factor. She touched her neck which had a slightly darkened mark left behind and felt. free. Even her full strength was starting to return."Heh, guess angel magic's no match for Home Depot?", Caleb stated impetuously.Camilla was still processing what happened but came out with, "S-señor, how...how did you do that? Didn't the magic affect you at all?!""Not really, I felt a little tingly when I pulled the collar loose after snipping the lock. Other than that, fine.", Caleb said with an honest grin. Camilla turned to face him, utterly baffled by his statement. How was this human so resistant to a potential and concentrated form of magic?! What kind of mental fortitude does he have?!It was then Camilla thought she saw something glow under Caleb's shirt near his chest then quickly fade. She shook her head and it was gone, must've been her imagination."So how do you feel? ", Caleb inquiredCamilla stepped out of the van unfolding her wings and stood near the entrance. Her tail swayed slightly as she closed her eyes and concentrated. Caleb watched in amazement as her entire body from horn to tail was enveloped in a glowing bluish-black aura. She then began to levitate a few inches off the ground as her formerly dim red eyes shined brightly. Her feet touched back to the ground as the aura around her slowly dissipated. She looked at her hands before clenched them firmly and smiled in satisfaction. She began chuckle to herself somewhat unsettlingly."Have...have your powers returned?", Caleb asked stepping out of the van approaching her cautiously. She turned to him with a very fittingly devilish smile."Not fully señor my magic was sealed for a very long time, but it won't be long before I am at my peak! I can already feel my mana flowing like la corriente Más Grande(the largest stream). I just...I just feel muy fantastica right now! Oh gracias, muchas gracias señor Caleb!", Camilla stated before wrapping Caleb in a tight hug easily lifting him off the ground."Ack... y-your welcome...now...please you're...gonna break my spine", Caleb strained as she squeezed him. Camilla broke from her elation and looked down at the human whom she was pressing firmly in between her large breasts. Her heart stopped as her face burned in embarrassment before unceremoniously releasing him causing him to fall on his rear."Ah! L-lo siento señor. I... don't know where that came from!", Camilla stammered"It's cool, you're just really happy. Happens to everyone.", Caleb sat up rubbing his posterior as the blush on his cheek faded, "So, whaddya say we take those collars off the others?", He finished stuffing the bolt cutters down his pocket.Camilla gave him a surprised, "J-Ju would really do that? You aren't afraid we may attack you once we're free?""Nah, why would I be? I said that I trust you and I trust them too. If any of you really wanted to hurt me you would've done so by, now right?", Caleb said as Camilla gave him a small smile, "Come on, let's go."Camilla walked beside Caleb passed the front entrance to the rooms around back. She continued glancing at him with a small grin and a light blush. They rounded the corner passing large green garbage container until the rooms were in sight. As they continued, Camilla couldn't explain it, but she felt a bit uneasy walking through the dimly area. It felt like they were being watched by someone or something. The surroundings were quiet. Way too quiet for comfort. She focused her sense of hearing to the rooms the devil girls were in. They were quiet. The lights were still on so there's no way they were all asleep. Many of them seemed livelier before she left anyway.Camilla watched as Caleb approached the 1205 door and knocked on it."Hey, girls it's me. I have a surprise for you guys. It involves the removal of certain irritating object on your necks.", Caleb called from outside. Camilla continued to watch when she noticed a shadowy silhouette moving on the roof above their and froze in shock when a pair of fiery eyes met her's."Oh, that would be your head then.", snarled a very sadistic voice as the door of the room opened. Instead of one of the devils, Caleb and Camilla's eyes widened in absolute terror as a large female wolf-like liminal with fire pouring from its eyes wearing a silver collar. She stepped out with a wicked grin brandishing her large red and black claws. Caleb stepped backwards hastily as he tripped and fell on his butt. He looked above him as a black blur soared above him before landing behind him and Camilla baring its claws and fangs menacingly and emitting a low growl. Camilla turned sideways with her wing unfolded eying them in a defensive stance. Camilla turned to silver collar and her blood run cold at what she saw."S-señor Caleb, the others.", Camilla spoke. Caleb looked passed the creature in front of him at another wolf-like creature inside the room and the girls cowering in fear bunched together on the floor. It held Heidi in a choke hold as the latter squirmed to get free to no effect before throwing her hard against the floor.The 1207 door opened and out stepped yet another large wolf liminal. This one with a ''X" scar on its stomach held Sharon by the neck effortlessly as she kicked and jutted to free herself. Caleb tried desperately to process what was happening and why. Suddenly the silver collar one bent down staring at him like he was the juiciest steak in the world."W-W-Who are you!? W-What are you?", Caleb stuttered fearfully."Name's Chrolla, and I will be your predator this evening...Ugh I've been around those Malones too long!", She snarled is disgust.Caleb finally noticed their overall appearance and his eyes widened in realization that he's seen images of their species online, "Y-you guys are hellhounds!""Ding ding ding ding ding, somebody give this man a cookie.", The hellhounds that was behind them jeered.Caleb was horrified to see Sharon continued struggle gasping for air as the belly scarred hellhounds gave a satisfied chuckle."Release her right now perros sucio( filthy dog)!", Camilla shouted.Chrolla snorted, "Why should you care? It was her scent that led us here."Camilla and Caleb were confused for a moment before the scarred hound stated, "Speaking of she smells pretty good. Hey sis, mind if I take first bite? Never had devil meat.""Eh, why not? They aren't gonna miss one.", Chrolla stated nonchalantly. Scar smiled widely brandishing her claws ready to strike at Sharon's head. Caleb got up quickly and Camilla was ready to lunge at him full force, that is until Scarlett ran out screaming with a chair and slamming it as hard as she could into Scar's back. It broke into apart from force leaving the legs and seat on the ground. Scar groaned and lurched forward in pain dropping Sharon. Sharon coughed uncontrollably holding her chest as Scar turned to Scarlett with a vengeful scowl. Scarlett tried striking again but Scar caught the remnants of the chair snatching and tossing it away then smashing her fist hard into Scarlett stomach. She held her stomach in agony as he legs trembled before falling to her knees coughing blood."I changed my mind. This one looks much tastier.", Scar licked her lip showing her large fangs raising her claws ready to look off Scarlett head. Before could step forward, the other hellhound jumped in front of her snarling and swiping at her face; which Camilla skillfully dodged.Caleb, having calmed a bit, stated, "STOP! Leave them alone! Please just tell us what you want!"Chrolla stepped in front of Caleb towering over him by a whole foot and a half, "Ain't it obviously by now little man, we're out hunting, and you in particular just happen to be our prey.""Y-you're after me? Why?", Caleb inquired nervously."Some guys we know said you stole from them and that you might be a tasty treat. Now we're not inclined to follow nobody's orders, but they said they wanted the devils here alive. For what? Don't know don't care?", Cholla finished with a sadistic chuckle.Camilla listened growing more and more anxious. Her magic still hasn't fully recovered so she can't use any spells but her superhuman strength, speed, and healing should give her a fair chance."Please listen you don't have to do this. You said yourself you don't take orders, so how about you let them all go?", Caleb paused and inhaled, "and... you can take me."Camilla's eyes widened at his declaration. The other devils heard it and we're shocked at his selflessness."Heh, you got guts little man.", Chrolla said before grabbing Caleb by the neck lifting him up as her flailed in a vain attempt at freedom, "too bad I'm gonna rip'em outta ya. AND take them back...well most of them. We may want seconds.""No!", Camilla stated trying to rush to Caleb but was stopped by the hellhound whose fiery eyes glared at her with killing intent. Upon closer inspection, the hound's eyes were different colors; one reddish-orange one grey (Let's call her 'Hetochrom'). Hana, Heidi and the other succubi looked on in sheer horror.Caleb continued struggling to pry himself from her iron grip as she pulled his face closer to hers. The murderous intent coupled with the delighted grin sending a chill down his spine. Caleb glanced at her large metal collar."Hehehe, your face is kinda cute.", She spoke vindictively as Caleb slowly reached into his pocket for the taizer, "I can eat you up.", she said open her drooling mouth wide showing her large canine teeth.Caleb turned it up to full voltage and said, "Eat this ya fuckin bitch.", before jabbing into the metal collar sending out electrical sparks as Chrolla hollered in intense pain. She released Caleb as she fell to her back convulsing. Caleb fell hard on his butt.The other hounds glared in shock(ha!). The one holding turned around with a confused expression watching her leaders body twitch wildly.Scar emitting a vicious snarl before lunging at Caleb, "What did you do to my sister you bastard?!"Camilla performed a spinning motion using her wings for extra momentum and smacked Hetochrom away with her wing. Scar leapt above Caleb ready to rip into him as the latter put up their arms defensively, but Camilla lunged into Scar knocking him away with a roundhouse kick. Scar was sent flying through the window of the 1205 room followed by the startling screams of the devils in it.The hellhound that was guarding them stared at her comrade in the pile broken glass and curtains. Her focus then went to the sight of Camilla sprinting to her with her wings tucked in. She instinctively guarded herself as Camilla delivered a devastated flying kick knocking her into the bathroom sink destroying the mirror. The hound shook off the trauma baring her fangs to lung at Camilla but was met in the face by the large Toshiba television Camilla threw smashed into her.Camilla turned to the devil twins, Heidi, and Sylvia who were shaking fearfully, "Vaminos amigos! Now! NOW!". The girls snapped out their shock and ran out of the room. Camilla gave a few more looks to the two incapacitated hellhounds that were both starting to come to. As she turned around, a pair of large black paws grabbed her shoulders and forcefully threw her into the wall. The hound pounced on Camilla; snarling, barking, and clawing her right arm, wings, and legs eliciting pained screams from Camilla. It bit and nashed at Camilla's neck, but she held the agape sharp fangs away from her with her undamaged arm. Her strength was beginning to wain as the fangs got close enough that scalding saliva dripped on her neck. Camilla felt around with her arm that started regenerating for any blunt object. Her hand landed on the large heavy bible, she grabbed it, and smacked the hound as hard as she could across the face before thrusting the good book in its mouth causing it yelp like an injured pup. It gagged on it for a second before Camilla delivered a fierce uppercut to the hound's jaw knocking the hound onto the table breaking it in half. Camilla panted heavily as her wounds began repairing themselves. She heard glass crackling and turn to see Scar slowly getting up emitting a low growl as the bits of glass that hadn't pierced her skin fell off. She pulled the curtain off her head and glared at Camilla."Grrrghh, you...damn c-", was all the hound could say before a lamp smashed into her head knocking her out again. Caleb stood over her as his hands trembled breathing erratically.He turned to Camilla who was panting as sharply as him, "The others are outside, let's move!"Camilla and they jumped through the former window hole passing Chrolla who began stirring out of unconsciousness. Hana, the twins, Julia, and Sylvia were trying to calm a hysterical Heidi muttering incompressible German while Jocelyn and Sharon were helping Scarlett to walk. She coughed up a little blood nearly stumbling.Caleb ran up to the group with Camilla at his side, "We have to go! They won't stay down for long!"The group finally noticed the pair and obeyed without a second thought; following Caleb around the corner to the front entrance."Where are we going?!", Sharon stated trying not to lose hold of Scarlett."Away from here!", Caleb quickly answered."But Scarlett's really hurt! I don't think she keep right now.", Julia said as Scarlett's breathing became more ragged.Caleb grunted and rushed to them, "Give her to me!", he said squatting down lowering his back. They carefully placed her on his back. Her red hair dangled over his shoulder and her wings and tail hung limply. He readjusted her a little higher supporting her more firmly.They pressed forward towards the entrance with Caleb and Camilla leading the group. They were just about the turn to the entrance doors before Caleb stopped in his tracks to the surprise of Camilla and the others. His eyes widened in horror at two black cars parked near the van and the men stepping out of them."Go back. Go back!", He stated backing up then turning around passing them. Camilla and the other devils were horrified to see Wick and his men. A few of them carried pump action shotguns. Heidi and Julia were about to scream but Camilla quickly smothered their faces in her large wings pulling them back behind the wall. They all ran to the back only to be stopped by Caleb again before they noticed two of the hellhounds helping Scar and Chrolla picking herself up from the ground shaking herself out of her trauma and emitting a deep growl.The group was caught in a pincer move. Hellhounds on one side Mafia on the other. Camilla couldn't fight them all off at once her magic still needed a bit more time to recharge. They all muttered and exchanged glances fearfully."W-What do we do? Camilla-sama? Caleb-kun?", Hana whispered tears forming in her eyes.Camilla and Caleb exchanged uncertain glances. Scarlett coughed in Caleb's ear making him flinch. In the process, he looked up at the roof edge just 10 feet above them. A lightbulb went off in his head."The roof!", He stated causing everyone to go silent, "Camilla the roof!"Camilla grinned understandingly, "Si, Señor"The last of the hellhounds joined the group as they sniffed catching the scent of their prey, ready to continue the hunt.Wick and two of his men (Andy and one of the burly guys) approached the counter where the Middle Eastern man was having his third bottle of five-hour energy. And and burly guy stood behind him at his sides."Excuse me Mr... uh", Wick trailed noticing the man wore no name tag."My name is Moazaam, but call me ''Mo'", the man said"Alright Mo, did a man named Caleb Bessle check in? Probably with some... company.", Wick"I'm sorry it's against policy. I can't tell you something like that man.", Mo said."It's really important though. We have important business with him, please.", Wick pleaded almost genuinely.Mo shook his head, " I am sorry"Wick placed his elbows on the counter meeting him at eye level, "look, I understand, you're just following company protocol and afraid you'll get in trouble. But you must also understand, how important this is for us. I ask one last time, please."Mo shook his head again, "I'm sorry, I wish I could help but I can't."Wick nodded stepping away from the counter and said, "Ok", before snapping his fingers. Andy and Burly guy grabbed the man lifting him over the desk slamming him into the floor. They proceeded to deliver several stomps and kicks to her stomach and chest while the man screamed. Wick snapped again, and they ceased their pummeling and lifted the man on the counter as he groaned in pain. They pinned him down as Wick approached them taking out his P30L. He leaned in and pressed the barrel underneath Mo's chin as he gasped and coughed."Now, and answer honestly, did he check in or not?", Wick spoke in a menacing tone pressing the barrel harder into his neck.Mo strained under the pressure. He was about to say something but a loud this sound above them caught their attention. It was followed by multiple other loud thuds each one louder or softer than the other. Wick and his men looked up in confusion as little bits of the ceiling started raining down. Wick released the man and anxiously bounded towards the door."Come on.", He stated plainly as Burly guy and Andy released the Arabic man. Mo slid down to the floor holding his chest and breathing heavily trying to compose himself. When he was settled enough he went around his desk and pressed the speed dial on his phone for 911 then reached for a shotgun inside an aluminum case."Ok, your next Julia", Caleb said as the greater devil nodded. She went up to Camilla and raised her arms enough for her to get her palms under Julia's armpits."Ready?", Camilla said, and Julia nodded, "Uno, Dos, Tres, despegue(lift-off)!"At the last word, Julia was propelled upwards. When she was a several feet above the roof, she looked down to her awaiting comrades, unfolded her wings, and glided downwards landing on the roof surface with a 'thud'. The other succubi embraced her before looking down to Caleb, Scarlett and Camilla.Caleb saw that Scarlett was still in bad shape then turned to Camilla and said, "You take her first."Camilla nodded and removed Scarlett from his back taking the girl in her arms bridal style the squatting in a jumping position. She sprung into the air like a rocket easily clearing the roof then unfolding her wings gliding down to the awaiting succubi. Sharon and Sylvia took Scarlett from Camilla supporting her on their shoulders. Camilla turned and looked down to Caleb who smiled widely giving her two thumbs up in praise."Alright, now get m-", Caleb started only to be interrupted by a bone-chilling growl. He turned his head shakily at the burning demonic eyes of the hellhounds crouched on all fours ready to lunge at him, "Crap baskets.", He said weakly.The hound lunged at him as he covered his face protectively expecting it shit ton of pain but instead hear a loud yelping of a dog. Next thing he knew, Camilla had swept him up bridal style and leapt up to the roof with him still in her arms. He quickly realized they were all in the center of the building's roof. The canopy was only about ten steps away."Are you alright señor?!", Camilla asked with a very worried expression."Yeah, thanks, now let's keep going!", Caleb said climbing out her arms noticing the other devils surrounding Scarlett's body with Sylvia and Sharon tending to her.Sylvia looked at him with fear in the eyes and said, "Scarlett's hurt really bad Mr. Caleb. I think that hit broke a few of her ribs. Her lungs are filling with blood!"Camilla look over to the injured Scarlett sorrowfully before Caleb approached Scarlett's body kneeling behind her head."Both of you, sit her up.", Caleb commanded and they both slowly lifted her upper body warranting pained whimpers from Scarlett then taking out the pair of bolt cutters. The other succubi gave him confused looks except for Camilla who immediately understood."W-what are you going to do?!," Sharon inquired."I'm going to remove her collar and restore her healing factor!", Caleb explained followed by an audible ''snap".The other succubi gave him dumfounded looks before Hana spoke candidly "Hey, now that I think about it, Camilla's collar is gone.".An audible clunk sound got their attention and their eyes widened at Scarlett's collar lying on the shingles and Caleb shaking off the tingling sensation. Before they could inquire further, four loud crashes accompanied by a powerful tremor that shook the roofs foundation loosening a bunch of the shingles. Caleb and the girls wore terrified expressions at the four hellhounds perched on all four ready to attack. The shingles and paneling where the stood had been terribly damaged by the impact. How they didn't fall through was a mystery. Camilla stood between them and the hounds. Her large wings spread outwards, tail swaying, and her bluish-black aura enshrouding her entire body. The girls emitted panicked screams as they ran past Caleb to a safer area. One of the succubi (Heidi) bumped Caleb making him stumble to keep his footing on the loose tiles and he dropped the bolt cutters. He watched in despair as they slid down and fell off the edge before picking up Scarlett and moving her out of harm's way. He then heard someone shout, 'Ow!", and looked around to where it came from."Ow! What the hell?!", Andy shouted holding the top of his head. He picked up the object that caused his pain as Mark walked to his side."Are those...bolt cutters?", Mark asked.Wick walked past them looking up to the roof suspiciously, "Forget about that, that sound just now. I'm sure it's the sound of trapped rats."One of the gangsters approached Wick, "I could see them from out near parking lot, looks like that guy and those devils are all up there. The hounds have them cornered.""Good get me a ladder", Wick ordered, and the gangster left only to be stopped by the Arabic man holding a shot gun."Drop your guns now and get on the-", was all Mo could say before a shell from one of the burly guys pump actions blew his chest to smithereens; sending his lifeless body flying into the wall.Andy and Mark stood speechless.Wick cleared his throat, "As I was saying, find a ladder!"'The hell?!', Caleb thought feeling his body jump from the sound of the gunshot. Camilla's and the hellhound named Chrolla glared at each other. Her shimmering red demonic eyes locked with hound's fiery demonic eyes. She and her pack mates emitted deep growls as they closed in on Camilla."Huh, you can use magic?", Chrolla said slightly confused.Camilla wordlessly never broke eye contact with Chrolla."Looks like she got that collar of hers off. The rest still got theirs on though.", Scar added grinning widely.Chrolla chuckled venomously, " Whatever, it just makes this hunt more fun. It's not like she can do too much by herself anyway."Camilla clutched her fist in irritation at the hound's words. The had some truth to them. Her mana was still not fully replenished. She needed more time. By her estimate, she could use 5 or 6 weak spells. Any stronger ones would deplete her mana faster making her become fatigued to the point of collapse. They'd be sitting ducks caught between the armed criminals below and the hungry mutts in front of them. Beads of sweat started to build on her forehead as the hounds slowly advanced on her. She took a step back and they smiled in satisfaction. They think she's going to retreat, she thought. She looked over her shoulder at the devil girls and Caleb finding the resolve to defend them to the end. Raising her arms, two large blue and black circular magic seals appeared in front of her palms, each with odd symbols on them, and took a defensive stance."Ju will not pass this line!", Camilla stated resolutely."Sure, about that?!", Chrolla stated as she lunged at Camilla with her pack following suit. Camilla spread her arms to fire at both sides. Caleb and a few of devil girls couldn't take their eyes while the rest averted their gaze in fear of the outcome.Instead of the sound of flesh tearing and explosions, the area was filled with the pained wails of, not only the succubi, but the hellhounds as well. The hellhounds collapsed holding their ears and Camilla was on her knees holding her own ears also wailing. Caleb turned to see each of the devil girls on their knees or backs rocking holding their ears in complete agony. It was like Jimmy Buffet concert. Caleb was very confused at what was wrong with everyone. The wailing suddenly stopped and was replaced by exhausted sighs of relief."Huh, this works on devils too.", came the voice of Wick. Caleb turned to see Wick standing on the roof's canopy (about 30 feet to their left) examining a kind of whistle and holding his P30L. Beside him were three men; one holding a pump action shotgun and two with small semiautomatic pistols. Caleb noticed below them were two men holding a ladder as another climbed up to join Wick. Caleb recognized one of the men with him as the one he knocked and dumped in the trench. He felt his blood run cold when he locked eyes with Wick.Wick started to walk towards them with his subordinates in tow as the other devils, now recovered from the ordeal, stared in complete terror. Camilla noticed him as well and felt her rage reach new heights. Wick glanced towards her with a smirk and she felt the urge to vomit."My, my, our runaways are cornered. I would make fiddler on the roof joke, but I feel it would be in bad taste.", Wick spoke twisting his gun playfully."HEY ASSHOLE! WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT FOR?!", Chrolla shouted still rubbing her ears as her pack mates gave the man hateful looks."I distinctly remember that you WEREN'T to attack the devils JUST the human. And you were supposed to call if you found them!", Wick stated glaring at hounds.Chrolla looked away dismissively waving her paw, "Eh, couldn't get a signal.""...Right. So, you are the negro that stole my devils.", Wick said now focusing on Caleb.Caleb gulped before saying, " L-look...I-""No, you LOOK!", Wick interrupted, " These things are now property of my family's organization. Do you know what we do with people who steal from our family? Lots of things, one of them being making them dog food."The hellhounds chuckled maliciously some of the licking their bared teeth.The other succubi wore terrified expressions too afraid to move a muscle. Caleb wanted to say something but choked on his words at Wick intimidating demeanor."Now, here's what is going to happen: I am going to take these devils and we will sell them all to the highest bidder. Then I'm going to cut your fucking head off and display it in a box. A glass boxes. All while the rest of your body is becoming hound shit.", Wick explained sardonically before he and his men stepped closer to the group.Camilla stood in between them flaring up her aura intimidatingly. It worked, Wick and his men backed up in shock. Wick noticed her collar was gone."JU WILL NOT TOUCH A SINGLE ONE OF THEM!", Camilla yelled stretching her hand out threatening to fire a spell."H-holy shit she can use magic?!", Andy shouted, "How'd she gets the collar off"Wick stepped in front of her hand surprising his men and Camilla."Go ahead just try it. Just know if you kill me, there's nobody to stop those hounds from ripping the others to shreds. Then you'd still have to contend with others in my group. They'll all die, but you'll still be here alone running with nowhere to go. What will it be...devil?", Wick finished in a dark tone that shook Camilla's resolve a bit so much her hand started to tremble.Camilla thought on what he said and reluctantly backed up allowing her aura to dissipate and lowering her head in defeat." Good, it's better this way really. Out there, no one will you. Everywhere your people go you're cast out like the leper. At least your kind's talent for pleasure will give you some semblance of a decent life.", Wick spoke, "What other choice do you have?"Camilla and many of the other succubi wore crestfallen expressions. Camilla's shoulders slumped as her wings and tail drooped and her head hung low. By some measure, they knew he was right. Everyone they had met had always treated them the same. Whatever moments of peace they had were immediately replaced with more sorrow and pain. Defeat had become as natural as magic usage for them."You're wrong!", Caleb stated. Wick, his subordinates, Camilla, the other devil; all their focus now on this one man.Caleb inhaled before walking towards Camilla and Wick, " Who gave you or anyone else the right to decide their purpose and choices for them? Who gave you the proof that says they aren't accepted anywhere? Who told you that BECAUSE they're devils that you can treat them however you want? Well, whoever it was, they're their full of shit! These girls ARE accepted; by people who are willing to give them a chance or two. I've known for a short time, but I can tell all of them, from Camilla to Scarlett are sweet girls. They've just been hurt by dickheads like you! They are DEVILS, but humans have done far worse shit that they've ever done to us. So, what's that make us?", Caleb finished stopping between them.Wick and Caleb glared at each other with Caleb wavering slightly from Wick's murderous gaze (and the fact he was holding a gun) but remained steadfast. Camilla stared at Caleb for what felt like decades her heart did somersaults in her chest. She never met a human so willing to not only trust them but defend their right to live how they want. She couldn't help but smile. The other devils stared in admiration at the young man. A few had tears form in their eyes. Even Scarlett sat up, having regained her healing factor, was overcome by a sense of relief."Are you done with your little hero speech?", Wick spoke cryptically. He then pointed his gun at Caleb and fired a round into his shoulder. Caleb shouted lurching slightly holding his wound as Camilla and the other devil's expressions now morphed to ones of shock, " Because I really hate those."Caleb backed up holding his bleeding wound feeling the warm liquid spill through her fingers and gritted his teeth picking himself up. He signaled for Camilla to start moving backwards and she did. He wore an angry glare as he once again locked eyes with Wick and said threw his teeth, " You. Thought I was being a hero? Gimme a break, I'm not even a good person.""Oh, really?", Wick inquired with fake interest stepping closer to Caleb."Yeah, because a good person...", Caleb said stopping in his tracks with he and Camilla now away from the canopy section of the roof. Wick smirked knowing they were trapped; failing to notice the loose shingles on the roof. He took another step forward and his foot slid sideways causing to lose his footing and fall on his side., "...would tell you tell you to watch your step!", Caleb finished.Wick rolled down the roof grunting and yelling; dropping his P30L. He managed to catch hold of something before he fell off the edge. Two of his subordinates went to his aid and two burly guys approached Caleb and Camilla pumping their guns ready to fire. Camilla summoned a magic seal in her right hand and fired off a pulsing blue energy blast that spread over them like mist. They were stunned before became woozy falling over dropping their guns then tumbling down the roof to the concrete below. Caleb quickly picked up Wick's P30L.They heard a loud shriek along with the snarls of the hounds. Caleb and Camilla turned around, their eyes widening in shock to see Chrolla and a smaller hound glaring at them brandishing their claws threateningly while behind them, Hetochrom was circling the girls rounding them up while Scar had one the twins pinned under her paws, fangs bared and ready to tear into the devil's neck."No please let her go!", The devil twins named Moka pleaded before Hetochrom barked and gnashed at her to stay in her place. She looked on in despair for her twin shaking her head."I don't think I have to explain this ultimatum to you.", Chrolla smirked before morphing to a vicious scowl, "Now put the gun down ya zap happy prick! And you cool that magic shit!"Caleb slowly lowered himself never breaking eye contact with the hound. Chrolla watched him intently ready to lunge and tear him apart as soon as the gun lay flat on the roof. The gun was inches to the roof surface until..."AHH, MY EYES! IT STINGS!", screamed Hetochrom as she stumbled back holding her face as she writhed on the ground. Caleb, Chrolla, and Camilla turned around in surprise at the scene before noticing something else even more shocking. Scarlett was standing, as the other devils around her gazed in awe, with a bright red aura swirling around her before dying down slightly. A reddish-orange magic seal was around her hand. Scar stared at her, jaw hanging open in disbelief as Scarlett glared with hateful eyes. Scar's expression morphed into a scowl before turning her attention back to the devil she had pinned under still squirming like the weakling it was.With a deep snarl, Scar bared her fangs and lunged for the twin's face. In a swift dance-like motion, Scarlett swing her arm firing a small orb of energy surrounded by glowing red-black mist at the hound. The energy ball collided Scar before her fangs could even touch Moka's sister. The hellhound was sent flying off the roof howling in pain and landing on a nearby garbage container. Scarlett's suddenly faded, and she fell to one knee breathing heavily in exhaustion having overexerted her mana. The other devils rushed to her while Moka and her sister hugged each other crying in relief.Chrolla was confused. Just how many of these devils could use their magic anyhow, she thought. No sooner the thought crossed her mind, it was replaced by a sudden intense pain in her back leg. She fell on one knee yelling from the pain. Camilla had done a swift kick to the large hound while she wasn't looking. Camilla then grabbed the hound by the ears as Chrolla yelped from the act and threw her off the roof with all her might. The other hellhound rushed Camilla but was stopped by Camilla's spell that caused a bluish-black ring of misty appear around its neck before being lifted off the ground. It kicked and flailed holding its throat gagging before being tossed off the roof with a wave of Camilla's hand.Caleb watched the events unfold before him in disbelief. He made a mental note to NEVER piss off any devils if he survived this. He slowly stood up wincing from the bullet still in his shoulder. He looked up at Camilla who had her back turned to him and noticed her breathing becoming heavy. Those last few spells must've taken a bit out of her. Before Caleb could step forward, her felt something hard press up against the back of his head followed by a 'click' that he's disturbingly getting used to. Caleb sighed in exasperation raising his arm up with the P30L dangling limply off his thumb. Camilla heard this and spun around to see one of Wick's subordinates (Mark) pressing a pistol to the back of Caleb's head. She froze noticing Wick's cold expression.Wick move over to Caleb's side, reached up and took back his gun. Caleb kept his arm raised"You know, I'm getting tired of playing childish games boy", Wick spoke every word laced in venom as he walked around Caleb dragging his pistol head from his heart to his temple. He the then slammed the pistol's handle hard into the wounds on Caleb's shoulder."GAAGHHHH!", Caleb shouted falling to his knees holding his arm. Mark never took his sight from Caleb's headCamilla pointed both of her hands forming two large magic seals at the men, "STOP! Leave him alone. Or I kill you both!"Wick glared at her. Mark kept looking back and forth between the two uncertainly. Wick smirked amusedly before kicking Caleb hard in the stomach warranting strained grunts from him. Camilla clenched teeth furiously."Shame. I was going to have you as one of my pets. You probably would've been my favorite.", Wick ruminated before pointing it at Camilla's head, "But it looks like proved to be more trouble than you're worth. I wonder which is fast. Your Harry Potter horseshit or my bullets", Wick finished as he and Camilla had their own little Mexican standoff.Before the two could reenact a Tarantino movie, sirens from MON Forces and Cullman county police could be heard approaching the area. Everyone gazed out at the motel driveway as two MON vans suddenly pulled into the driveway; followed by two Cullman county police cruisers. Caleb having recovered from the trauma, rose up with a sigh of relief. Because he had officially run out of idea at that point. Camilla and the other devils wore elated smiles knowing they were finally safe. Wick was in utter shock that HE, one of the best Boyviks (Russian mafia rank meaning 'warriors') in his organization-so good he's close to becoming a Brigadier (Russian Mafia rank meaning "Captain")-and was outwitted by a fat negro and 9 powerless demon freaks. It made his blood boil.Wick performed a leg sweep on Camilla knocking her down. Camilla tried to get up to defend herself, but Wick was to quick and was already standing over her with a point blank shot to her skull. The other succubi gasped in horror. Wick pinned her by pressing his foot firmly to her wing and she yelped from the pain. Caleb was about to help her only to be met by the same gun barrel pressing to back of his head with another barrel pressing against his temple (by Andy).Wick pulled back the trigger as Camilla stared down the empty black hole on the barrel."Like I said, more trouble than you're WORTH!", Wick finished as his finger squeezed the trigger and Camilla shut her eyes accepting her fate. Caleb stared in utter helplessness.Before Wick could end the devil woman's life, a dark blue and yellow blur swooped past him. He looked down in confusion at his empty palm that once held his gun.Andy and Mark gave confused looks before the same blur swooped past them and their guns were gone."~Ha-ha looking for something boys~", came a high-pitched voiceEveryone looks above them to see woman soaring above them wear dark blue and yellow MON armor. Her dark blue fur covered her long three legs and large bat ears and wings. She wore a blindfold, likely to rely more on her natural sonar. A werebat!At this point, the entire parking was crawling with police and MON agents. A few guests that were staying heard all the commotion and we're outside as well.Wick, Caleb and the others looked down more police cars and vans joined the fray."We have you surrounded! Get down with your hands spread flat on the ground!", An officer announced.Andy and Mark looked at each other and decided they were out of their league and pushed Caleb attempting to make a run for it down the other side of the roof. They were immediately tackled and pinned each with a large claw on their heads. The werebat bent down at her waste grinning at them maliciously and said, "You heard'em loves. Down and the ground hands spread flat. So spread'em!", The two immediately obeyed.Below them, MON units were dealing with the hellhounds and police had just apprehended more of Wick's men. Four men lay on the ground in handcuffs with two of them (the burly guy) apparently coming out of a hallucinogenic state and sustained minor injuries. MON units were having a much harder time. Monochrome and the other hound (I couldn't think of a name) were fleeing the motel grounds, knocking people out of their way and evading capture. Eventually they were surrounded and swarmed by agents. They fought hard injuring a few units before finally being subdued by a very tall and muscular MON agent in heavy armor and a single horn sticking from her forehead. An ogre. The two hounds were pinned before being placed in high-grade carbon fiber restraints. Chrolla and Scar managed to evade capture running into the nearby wooded area and Mon units quickly went after them.Wick grit his teeth angrily before looking down at his palm remembering his lifeline. He swiftly stomped Camilla's stomach before running to the roof edge and jumped. He landed on the nearby trash container and climbed down stumbling from the impact. He limped his way to the corner towards the back of the motel and clenched his fist."FANTINA!", He yelled to the top of his lungs. The palm of his van suddenly began to glow with goat symbol before the space near the middle of the area began to distort. A large glowing crack appeared before Wick."Heyo, things going ok? I'mma take a wild guess and say no", said the voice of Fantina"There's no time! I have to inform Uncle now!", Wick stated."Alright, alright, just step on through. I'm a little tired so hurry up before it closes.", Fantina said.Wick could hear the police approaching and made haste for the portal. He was a few feet from safety before he was shoved out of the way by Scar. Wick glared at her in surprise."Sorry, but I can't afford to get deported!", Scar said with signs of panic in her voice. She had a small bullet stuck on her back."No, wai-", Wick called out, but it was too late, the hound leapt through the portal and the entire thing collapsed. Wick's mouth hung agape before being tackled by two police officers. He struggled as the placed him in cuffs and stood him up. The officer then began reading him his rights. As the officer continued, Wick looked up ahead to see Caleb and Camilla staring down at him. Camilla scooped Caleb up, unfolded her wings and glided down to the ground getting the attention of the officers. Two more officers showed up and approached the Caleb and Camilla."You must be the guy we received the emergency call from. The one filed under missing persons.", The officer said to Caleb before turning to Camilla, "And she must be with hostages. They're currently being assisted by MON agents."He was right. The other devil girls were being helped off the roof by Mon agents. One of the agents was an Arachne so they just had down individually into an elastic net of spider silk. The werebat from earlier was busy taunting Andy and Mark as they were being put into police custody. Meanwhile, a few of the officers were busy dealing with the body of the Middle Eastern man killed by Wick's men. At the same time, two ambulance truck and large black van came pulling into the driveway with a dark elf in the passenger seat."Yeah, that's me. Glad you guys made it, argh shit.", Caleb said before wincing from the pain in his shoulder.Both officer's eyes widened before one said, "S-sir, you've been shot!""Uh-huh, me and that asshole had a bit of a disagreement. And he reeaallly wanted to make his point clear", Caleb stated as Wick glared at Caleb with murderous rage.The officers gave Wick a look before nodding and one of them said, "Alright get him out of here"The officers holding Wick led him to the front with a third cop tagging behind. Wick was silent the entire time but continued to glare at Caleb and Camilla as they wanted him in disdain when he left.One of the officers that was left came up to a Caleb, "Sir, I need you both to come with me. We have paramedics waiting to treat your injuries"Caleb noticed Camilla standing there beside him with an aloof expression and trembling."Ok, hang on one minute though", Caleb said before walking up to Camilla gently taking her hand in his. She stared down at him. Her eyes now sparkling, trembling ceased, and her heart pounding for the umpteenth time tonight, "It's alright, Ms. Sartana, you guys are safe now."Camilla couldn't help but smile down at the young man with the beautiful brown eyes she'd started becoming accustomed to. The look of genuine care in his face melting into her heart and calming her nerves."Jes, gracias señor", Camilla utteredCaleb then walked up to the warzone that was once their motel rooms and stood a good distance away from them."Oof, I hate to imagine how expensive it's gonna be to fix all this.", Caled stated looking at the completely dark rooms, "Really just wanted you guys to feel safe for a while.""Señor?", Camilla inquired"I-I'm sorry. I'm just being stupid, hehe""Señor, you d-", Camilla walked up to Caleb but stopped when she heard a low growl. She turned her head and noticed a faint flicker of orange flame within the dark room and with it a large figure. It stepped closer revealing Chrolla. The hound wordlessly glared at Camilla then turned her attention to Caleb. Her eyes widened in horror. The hound lunged from the room with a ferocious snarl."SEÑOR, WATCH OU-AH!", Camilla rushed to shield Caleb only to be knocked away by the hound's huge paw. Caleb yelled as the hounds scooped him in its arm and ran off into thick wooded area.The officer quickly ran to retrieve Mon agents to help as Camilla picked herself off the ground rubbing her injured jaw. Then focused on the woods.Meanwhile, Chrolla rushed through the thicket with Caleb held like heavy baggage. Caleb grunted and coughed trying to keep the foliage out of his face and mouth. Chrolla stopped in a small clearing just far enough away from Mon and roughly tossed Caleb to the ground warranting pained grunts from him.She then approached him snarling and baring her fangs while wearing a very murderous look on her face. Her claws were spread wide ready to tear into him. Caleb struggled to get up and simply shuffled away from her."Aww trying to run? Where'd that fire go!? You know that little electroshock you pulled on me is the most damage any humans ever done to me. So, congrats, you succeeded in giving me a real reason to kill ya", Chrolla growled venomously, "That and probably getting my pack mates deported.""W-wait...why waste time trying to kill me? You could just run!", Caleb pleaded.Yeah, call me a glutton, but I never pass up free food.", She stated maliciously before lunging at ready to rip into him like a Christmas present. Caleb shielded his face with his arms expecting to be mailed to death. Only it never came and all he heard was a loud dog yelp followed by the crunch of wood breaking.Caleb uncovered his face and was surprised to see Chrolla rubbing his head picking herself off the shattered remains of a hollow log. He then noticed a pair of furry legs attached a tight rear end in denim shorts and dog-like tail looking over him. His eyes widened in surprise."Lyca?!", Caleb stated as the werewolf position herself between him and the hellhound. She ignored him and continued to glare intently at Chrolla.Chrolla recovered and got on all fours snarling and circling Lyca trying to intimidate her. Lyca emitted her own growl baring her fangs."My what big teeth you have.", Chrolla chuckled maliciously before baring her fangs, "but mine are bigger.""Touch him and I'll kill you.", Lyca snarled folding her ears back.Chrolla scowled angrily her fiery eyes aglow, "Pup, I'll chew you up and spit you out""Chief, run", Lyca whispered to Caleb."Wha- Lyca wai-!", before Caleb could finish Chrolla lunged at them and Lyca charged her. Caleb watched as they tackled each other to the ground barking and snarling trying to bite and claw into each other. The two broke apart for a moment and Chrolla continuously swiped at Lyca. With incredible speed, Lyca dodged each attack while getting in several kicks to the hound. However, Lyca's attacks were only a fraction of the hound's strength. Chrolla lunged at Lyca to which the latter jumped over and bounced off the hound's head causing her to faceplant on the ground. Chrolla snarled in irritation and lunged at Lyca again. Lyca tried to dodge again only, to her shock, for the hound to catch her by the leg in midair then slam her hard against the ground. Then Chrolla delivered a powerful kick sending Lyca flying into a tree with force to expose the roots. Lyca was all fours gagging and hacking up some blood clutching her stomach. The hound approached Lyca fearsomely snarling as she brandished her claw. Chrolla rose her mighty paw as Lyca prepared for her death. Suddenly Chrolla dodged to the side. Lyca stared in surprise as Caleb had tried to zap the hound again. Chrolla smirked easily grabbing his arm, twisting it as he dropped the taizer, and tossed him away. Caleb groaned in agony wheezing sharply through his teeth."There ya go, get some fire in that belly!", Chrolla giggled maliciouslyCaleb sharply sucked in are through his clenched teeth and glared daggers are the hound, "Y-you...*hack* I'm the one you want right? Leave her out of this!"The hound approached him and stood over the groveling human. She looked down at him with her fiery eyes filled with malevolence and said," hah, alright little man! I'll start with you before getting to that pup."Chrolla pinned Caleb with both her paws and opened her mouth showing off her very large incisors. Caleb refused to take his eyes off the hound. For once, he'll face death. She lunged for his neck, but before she could chomp onto his arteries, Lyca jumped on Chrolla's back clawing at her face from behind inciting pained screams from the hound as blood trickled down her face. Chrolla thrashed and clawed at Lyca to get her off but the persistent werewolf dug her foot claws into the hound's sides and restrained her arms. Lyca gave a loud bark before sinking her fangs into the hound's shoulder warranting a growl of pain from her. Finally, Chrolla had had enough. She fell backwards putting her full body weight into Lyca and forces her to release her. Lyca struggled quickly to get up and continue her attack but Chrolla rushed her. Before Lyca could dodge or defend Chrolla slashed her sending the werewolf flying while making a loud canine yelp in pain. Lyca's body was sent tumbling to the ground before stopping motionless."NO!", Caleb as he stared at his fallen friend in despair. Tears started to form in his eyes.The hellhound smiled in unsavory delight before turning to Caleb, "Poor pup. Now it's your turn."Caleb closed his eyes as tears streamed down his cheeks."Take her down", came an unknown voice catching Caleb and Chrolla attention. Chrolla suddenly felt sharp prick in her back. Then another. And another, and another, and another. She felt her body become heavy like lead before falling over face first in the dirt revealing the tranquilizers in her back. Caleb was surprised when they are came flooding with Mon agents."Threat neutralized!", said one of agents before a few of them came with stretchers.Camilla then came from out of the group and ran up to Caleb, "Señor, are you alright?!""Lyca...", Caleb listlessly said."Que?", Camilla inquired"LYCA! SHE'S HURT!", Caleb shouted making Camilla jump before rushing to where Lyca still lying motionless. He fell on his knees when he saw condition she was in. She was still but just barely. She three deep from her rib cage to her lower abdomen all of which were bleeding heavily. Her body shook, and she made made tiny canine whimpers."Diablos mio.", Camilla uttered as she covered her mouth. A few Months agents came and surrounded them examining the poor wolf girl. One of them, a woman with fox ears and tail, said, "It's not good. At the rate she's losing blood...she'll die before we can get her to a medic.Caleb got closer and gently lifted Lyca's head into his lap lightly brushing her hair back as the dying girl weakly looked up at her host's tear drenched face. The usually bright energy in her eyes were now becoming dim."This is my fault! Again, someone dies because of me! Lyca, I'm so, so sorry you deserved so much better.", Caleb lamented cradling the wolf girl asCamilla's heart sank in despair at the young man and his friend. Suddenly a thought ran through her mind, at first, she wanted to ignore in favor of another option. But there were none."Señor Caleb, I-I know a way to save her.", Camilla stated shocking the Mon agents and Caleb."W-What are you talking about!?", Caleb choked out"Remember when I said there are members of my kind that steal life energy? Well, I know how. I believe I can use it to save her, but I will require your assistance.", Camilla explained"I'll do whatever it takes!", Caleb stated somewhat desperately"I-I am going to take some of your natural lifespan to heal her. About 3 years should be enough!", Camilla stated.A Mon agent suddenly erupted, "Now hold on a second, I'm certain this goes against interspecies law! Even if-""To hell with the goddamn law! If it saves her what does it matter?!", Caleb interrupted silencing the agent before turning to Camilla, "Ms. Sartana, what do I need to do?""Well I need to physically extract the essence of life from you. There are two ways of doing so...", Camilla trailed off fidgeting slightly nervous, "I am... going to try the less...messy option."Caleb was confused by the way she said that. A strained cough from Lyca brought him back, "Alright, let's just do it already!"Camilla got closer to Caleb until they were facing to face and cupped both sides of his face. Caleb stared into her bright red eyes seeing the amount of seriousness in her face."S-señor, do you trust me?", Camilla utteredCaleb nodded as Camilla grinned slightly from the amount of conviction in his eyes. Camilla inched her face closer to his and captured his lips on to her's. Caleb's eyes shot open in surprise. He didn't resist but he did feel a tinge of guilt as he thought of Mirabelle. They kissed for what felt like hours until Caleb's breath suddenly fell short, almost like he was choking on something. Camilla slowly released him their mouths still agape. To Caleb and the Mon agent's shock, a bright, glowing white stream of smoke-like energy connected between them went flowing out of Caleb's mouth into Camilla's. Caleb felt as though her was being suffocated failing to catch any breath. Once Camilla got all she needed, her mouth shut, and the stream of energy disappeared. Caleb inhaled sharply before coughing uncontrollably. He soon regained control before he, and the mon agents, stared in wonder at the sight of Camilla's entire body surrounded bring blue aura and odd glowing red symbols all over her body. She extended her arms, palms facing down at Lyca's wounds, and all the blue aura started flowing from body down Lyca's body. The wounds began closing and Lyca's body began pulsating with a faint blue light. The wounds fully healed not even leaving scars. The light dimmed around Lyca's body and the glowing symbols on Camilla's faded away. Lyca began to stir as she slowly rose up to the shock of Caleb and the Mon agents. Lyca groaned from an intense headache holding her forehead before her eyes fluttered open and looked around."C-chief?", Lyca uttered languidly finally noticing Caleb.Caleb, without thinking, took the werewolf in his tight embrace, "Lyca! Lyca! You're ok!""Chief...too tight... can't...breath", Lyca strained as her host squeezed the life out of her.Camilla softly smiled at them leaning to back using her arms as supports. She was tired. That exchange of mana took a lot out of her. Perhaps she didn't have to add an extra 6 year her own lifespan to the process, but she knew those wounds were too fatal for just 4....Afterwards, Mon forces took Caleb, Camilla, and Lyca to the front of the motel where the paramedics had sought up. Camilla was taken by Mon agents for questioning along with the other devils. He received treatment for the bullet in his shoulder was given something to alleviate the pain in his body. All the while, Lyca refused to leave his side.Caleb sat on the ambulance van watching paramedics pushing a grey body bag before a voice caught his attention."D... Dear?", A soft voice uttered but Caleb heard it clear as day. He too up nearly losing his balance from the pain killers but Lyca supported him. Both looked up to see Mirabelle standing several feet away from them cupping her mouth as tears streamed down her face."Moon pie.", Caleb spoke dreamily with a loving grin.Mirabelle rushed to Caleb almost knocking him to the ground embracing him tightly while sobbing and rubbing her head into his chest. Tears soaked into his shirt to his bandages."Dear. My dear Caleb! Thank the gods my love is safe!", Mirabelle wept in joyCaleb rubbed her back to calm his little trembling centaur before Lyca jumped in too."Mira!", The she wolf chimed.Mirabelle wrapped her arm around her giving Lyca a relieved grin, "Lyca, you're ok! I was so worried! I was afraid you might get hurt."Lyca was about to say something but Caleb shot her a look and shook his head. Mirabelle looked back to Caleb a bit puzzled and he shot a goofy grin. He'll tell her what happened when they've had time to decompress."Aren't you guys the happiest bunch", came the sarcastic voice of Sterling. Caleb and the girls released their embrace to face their exchange coordinator. Caleb noticed his bandaged-up chest and burn on his neck."You look like you've been through the ringer Mr. Bistle.", Sterling said noticing Caleb's bandages."It's Bizzell and I could say the same for you.", Caleb said with mock irritation. In truth, he was glad to see him."True, but I still have my great personality.", Sterling jokedCaleb rolled his eyes with a smile as Lyca and Mirabelle smiled as well." You wouldn't happen to have the phone you used to contact us, right?", Sterling inquiredCaleb reached into his back pocket and pulled out Fat bastard's phone, "here it is."Sterling swiped up, raising an eyebrow at the wall paper before looking through the contacts then nodded, "Thank you. This will be a big help.""So... did they arrest all of them?", Caleb asked as Lyca and Camilla turned to hear the answer.Sterling paused for a second putting the phone away, "Yes. They've all been placed into custody. You know, you and the others are very fortunate to have survived. The Malone Family is one of the most dangerous criminal groups near South Central. That man who was the leader of the men pursuing you was Jakob Malone. A ruthless former explosives expert that's murdered several people-human and liminal alike. He's even killed a... few good police officers.", Sterling trailed remembering the police chief.Caleb and the girls stood in shock that someone like that was right at their front door. Caleb felt like he just got away by the skin of his teeth."D-did you see him on your way over? When they loaded him up in the car?", Caleb inquired trying to hide how worried he really was.Sterling paused again and stated in a deep, disdainful voice, "Ohhh yeah. I see him. They loaded him up and put a dozen restraints on him.", Sterling finished. If he was being honest, as soon he saw Wick's face the first thing her wanted to do was break his jaw. It took all his self-restraint to keep from running up and killing the man that killed his friend."As long as he's off the streets, I couldn't give half a cat shit if they put him UNDER the prison.", Caleb stated.Sterling chuckled lightly, "Oh, don't worry. I think we can do much more than that with what we now have."Caleb nodded a bit satisfied by his answer when Camilla suddenly came running towards him energetically."Señor Caleb!", Camilla stated before giving Caleb a hug pressing his face into her large cleavage much to Mirabelle's shock and Lyca's irritation. The latter of whom had very mixed feelings towards the situation.Caleb's was mushed into her mounds to the point of suffocation before rapidly tapping her shoulder to release him and she did."Haaaawohhh, ok. Hi Ms. Sartana, you look happy.", Caleb uttered regain his composure.Sterling then spoke up, "Ah, Ms. Sartana so you're the team in the words were talking about. Thank you so much, we're truly, truly grateful for your help.", He finished as he flashed a knowingly angry glare towards Lyca who shuddered before looking away in shame. There was an awkward silence for a moment as Mirabelle looked at everyone puzzled at their behavior.Caleb cleared his throat breaking the silence, "Anyway, is there something you wanted to talk about?""Oh Jes, señor, moi cantiqua. We all just wanted to tell you the good news.", Camilla stated happily as Mirabelle and Lyca tilted their heads curiously. 'all?', they thought."Ah, are the others sti-GAH!", Caleb was cut off as something landed on his back and a pair of short, blue slender legs dangled off his shoulder. Looking down above his head was Hana with big devilish smile plastered on her face. Mirabelle jumped slightly as she and Lyca gave a confused look at the strange blue girl riding Caleb's head."Caleb-kun!", Hana squealed cheerfully. The others devil girls came running past Camilla and surrounded Caleb with an adoring twinkle in their eye each trying to talk at the same time. Mirabelle and Lyca stood in shock at the gaggle of girls now ogling their human. Mirabelle shook wanting to stop them as Lyca was two seconds away from yanking them all off him. Scarlett was the last to join them and stood next to Camilla. She watched as the other devil's fawn on Caleb and turned her nose up trying to hide her blush."Lo siento, señor. When I said I was going to see you, they wouldn't listen to anything else Mon personnel had to say.", Camilla said.Caleb managed to calm the excited devil girls. Hana giggled as he gingerly removed her from his head placing her with the group. He raised an eyebrow at Camilla who shrugged with dubious innocence then at Scarlett who turned away refusing to make eye contact. He looked at the others around him and noticed none of them were wearing collars anymore."Hey, I see you guys got your collars off.", Caleb stated"Oh yes!", Sharon stepped forward gesturing at her neck, "There's this Mon human guy who specializes in enchantment removals.""What are the odds!?", Julia added."Und look, our magic ist slowly returning.", Hiedi stated as a green magic seal appeared in her hands.Caleb nodded. He wants to question how absurd their luck was that such a person exists. But, he decided to just go with it saving himself a headache.Lyca glided over to Caleb and elbowed him softly the cleared her throat. Caleb's eyes shot open in realization."Oh right, right! You guys, I wanna introduce you to my friend's slash houseguests.", He said putting himself between Mirabelle and Lyca, "Mirabelle and Lyca these are the girls. The girls, Mirabelle and Lyca.", He said gesturing between the two groups."N-nice, t-to meet you all.", Mirabelle uttered shyly huddling close to Caleb."Heya!", Lyca said as her eyes drifted to Camilla. They both exchanged a small grin to each other."Wait, you're a host for ICEP?!", One of the twins stated"Yep, been one for these two little sweethearts for a couple months now.", He stated as he petted both Lyca and Camilla and they swooned lovingly."So... what's this I hear about good news?", Caleb inquired and they all immediately bombarded him with chatter forcing him to interject, "Ok, Ok, please just someone get to the point!"Sylvia stepped up now, "Basically, we've been given refuge in Interspecies Affair's civil development facility. We'll be given the option either to live in their care receiving job training and education on human society until we can make our own way. Or we could be placed in the care of a host fitting our choices with a thorough background check.""Oh, that's fantastic news. Glad you guys are getting a shot at making it. Best of luck to all of you.", Caleb said with a supportive grin. He looked at the devil girls who all suddenly wore somber expressions."Hey, why you guys upset? This is good news, right?"Most of them remained silent. Camilla held her chest sadly as Scarlett crossed her arms dejectedly. It was Julia who finally spoke up, "It is! But...thing is...it only works if you're already registered in any globally recognized Interspecies Affairs office...and...", She trailed looking over at Camilla."Camilla isn't registered in any I.A. branch, not even in her home country.", Scarlett said tired of Julia stalling before looking away dejectedly.Caleb turned to Camilla who despondently avoided eye contact, "So... what about you two?""I... will more than likely be deported from dis country.", Camilla stated forlornly.Caleb, Lyca and Mirabelle were shocked by her statement. Caleb the turned to Sterling."Mr. Sterling is that true?! Can they really do that?!", He inquired in an urgent tone."Yes, they can. Unless she has legal identification or if a host is willing to help her get registered, Interspecies Affairs will have no choice but to deport her.", Sterling explainedCaleb was stunned with disbelief. After all they went through, she can't even join her friends in finding a better life."N-no! I don't want to lose Camilla-sama!", Hana cried out"Yeah, if she can't stay...t-then we won't stay", Moka stated."That's right!", Her twin addedCamilla went to them and kneeled down, "Listen pequenos (young ones), do not throw away a chance at a rich life, none of you. I will be fine."Hana and the twins hugged Camilla sobbing as she embraced them. The other devil girls wore doleful expressions.Caleb felt a lump in his throat at the sight. He glanced at Mirabelle then Lyca and saw the grim looks on their faces. He thought for a second and had an idea."H-hey, Mr. Sterling, you said she needed a host to get her registered right?", Caleb inquired trying to sound more confident. Everyone turned their attention towards him. Devil girls each had a mixture of surprised and hopeful gazesSterling smirked raising an eyebrow knowing exactly where he was going, "Yes, Mr. Bezzell, of course they need to be willingly to accept the host, but once that's done they can be automatically registered as a homestay. With all the rights that come with it.""Alright then.", Caleb then moved in closer to the devil girls, "Ms. Sartana would you allow me to be your host?"Lyca and Mirabelle exchanged looks with each other. The other devils, especially Scarlett, stared at Caleb as Camilla stood up with an astonished look on her face. She stepped forward looking down at his stern brown eyes."A-are you sure Señor?", She spoke softly to which Caleb nodded she was about to explode with happiness before Caleb stopped her"Oh, whoa wait a sec", he said before turning to Mirabelle and Lyca, "Are you both ok with this?"Both of them were happy that he took their feelings about the decision into consideration.Lyca grinned approvingly placing her hands on her hips, "She seems ok with me! As long as she doesn't go in my den (her room)."Caleb nodded then looked to Mirabelle. She froze from all the eyes her and started fidgeting and stuttering nervously. Lyca gave her a reassuring pat on her back forcing out of her nervous stupor. She saw then her dear Caleb giving her one of his smiles that always calmed her. She slowly exhaled."Y-yes, if my dear ok with it, I am too.", Mirabelle spoke with a smile.Caleb nodded then turned to Camilla, "Well then it's settled welcome to our fam-HAH!"Before Caleb could finish, Camilla scooped him up in a tight hug placing his head firmly in her cleavage the side of his face in kisses," oh coma puder habre tenido Tanta suerte de encontrade, gracias señor, muchas muchas gracias! You are truly wonderful!"Mirabelle and Lyca watched in frustration as she once again was smothering their human but remained calm. She just very happy. What harm could it...?"Arigato, Caleb-kun!", Hana clung to his back again nuzzling his face adoringly. Mirabelle and Lyca were knocked out of their collective thought."You are the sweetest guy ever! Thank you so much!", Sharon stated as she clings to his side trapping his arm in her soft flesh."Danke! Danke! I promise we will never forget your kindness! Never!", Hiedi added trapping Caleb's other side in warm, soft flesh.The twins, Sylvia, and Julia were next to join the group hug session as Scarlett stood by watching and giggling to herself with a small grin.Mirabelle and Lyca stood slack jawed before Lyca couldn't take it anymore and rushed into the group to join the hug fest. Mirabelle, feeling unsure and left out, found the confidence to charge in and cuddle up to her Dear as well."Gasp...guys, ah... please...I can't breathe...ack", Caleb tried to escape his prison of affection only to be repeatedly dragged back in and bombarded with more loving kisses, hugs and soft flesh grinding against him.Sterling chuckled taking a shot of bourbon, "Well, looks like you're kinda popular these days Mr. Bailey.""It's Bi...ack... zzell!"...The investigation lasted a little while longer before everything was packed up. Mon forces escorted the devil girls to Interspecies Affairs, Wick and his men were hauled off, and Caleb, the girls, and his new houseguest could finally breathe easy.Caleb and the girls got an escort home by police and Mon agents (The dark elf and a lizardman respectively). Caleb sat with his back to the wall of a large transport unit. To his right, Lyca slept on the cushioned benches, across from him, Camilla slept sitting with her wings wrapped around her front. Finally, kneeling to his left with her head in his lap as he gingerly stroked her scalp. They were all very tired. Despite tonight's events and the pain meds still in his system, Caleb didn't feel very sleepy. He decided to scroll through his (not Fat bastard's) phone which Sterling pulled a few strings to get out of evidence locker. He noticed a few texts from his supervisor Rodney asking how was his 4th of July weekend. Caleb reflected on everything in his mind for moment before responding with one word.'Eventful'.WR NoteI'm back baby! You know the old saying, "Life finds a way…to get in the damn way." Sorry for the late update fam, I have just been completely drained with work and school lately. Not to mention, I was kinda having a thing going with this girl from my differential equations class, but it quickly crashed and burned like goddamn Hindenburg. This chapter was meant to go out ON HALLOWEEN. I been trying to find time to complete this chapter for the longest; editing, proofreading, rewriting dialogue all for the sake of making it a good. Also, didn't intend for thins to be so long but I had A LOT of ideas. Kinda want to apologize if I killed and maimed left and right, but I wanted this chapter to cement a turning point in this story. Where ANYONE can be killed at any time, even main characters. Well, that's all I had to say. Be sure to Fav, follow, and comment all that good shit and, as always, this is Goat man saying PEACE FAM.
  
    Chapter Text
    Chapter 11: Everything Stays but ChangesA month passed since that eventful 4th of July weekend. A lot has happened; so much that's it's kinda hard to pick where to start. For starters, Mon and police launched a full-scale investigation using the information they collected from the crime scenes at the motel and warehouse, the GPS in the van used by Renalds and Fat Bastard, and several testimonies from Camilla and the devil girls. Wick and his men faced rigorous interrogation, but most were unwilling to give up anything. Not even Mark or Andy, though they didn't really know very much since both arrived in Alabama barely a month prior. They are all currently awaiting trial each with a possibility of life without parole.The hellhounds that were placed into Mon custody were also questioned. They were surprisingly less obstinate about giving up what they knew. Mainly because they said felt no real loyalty towards the organization and just wanted to get off if they could. The information they provided was substantial enough to help further the investigation. They were all soon deported and black listed by interspecies affairs. Furthermore, one of them was distraught over the whereabouts of her missing sister who disappeared at the motel. I.A. dispatched agents to locate the missing hound.It wasn't long before Mon and the police uncovered a more disturbing conspiracy within their system. It would appear the van used by Renalds and Fat Bastard to transport Liminal cargo was one of many issued by an agent operating and dealing with Liminal black market traders. Through their influence, guys like Renalds and Fat Bastard we're able to carry about their activities all while flying under the exchange programs radar. They were immediately brought into custody and discharged from ICEP. After disclosing the names of everyone they were dealing with which led to even more arrests of these 'phony agents' and their buyers. Host families were soon warned of any possible fraudulent agents and methods to help identify them.Second, with all these arrests the police got further and further into finally locating the underground liminal trade channel in Alabama. The police were able to find one of the Malone Family's meeting spots, a rental home near Hoover's Riverchase. The entire place had been vacated, oddly, without any trace of anyone ever being there. What's more bizarre, is that most of the furniture, floors, and even the walls in a very thin but sticky layer of red viscous fluid. According to forensics, it was some type of highly concentrated corrosion slime. It made gathering fingerprints or DNA traces impossible as it eroded away any trace.But, the police were even more surprised by what they found in a backyard shed on the premises. It was a grisly sight of the hellhound(Scar) that was reported to have alluded capture at the motel strung up to the ceiling by her arms in chains with her kneecaps broken. She hung limply with multiple bruises littering her body and face. She was severely dehydrated. What's more her tongue had been cut out of her mouth and along with some of her fangs. Above her where the chain was affixed to, the words 'ничто болван' were etched into the support beams. It was later translated to mean, 'worthless mutt'. The hellhound was immediately brought into interspecies affairs and received four days of rigorous medical treatment. Police wanted to try questioning her, but was denied by I.A. chairperson. She appeared to be extremely traumatized and hasn't even attempted to speak a word to anyone since being admitted into care.Nevertheless, the police and Mon forces continued to pursue the Malone Family and their associates by following different points along the trade channels. It wasn't long before they able to gradually slow the influx of extraspecies trafficking. Numerous liminals that were being abused and exploited by shady practitioners for the resources they produce or to be forced into servitude were rescued and put into the care of interspecies affairs. Although, police units were never able to arrest any other members of the Malone Family; soon concluding the organization had ceased activity due to all the heat being put on them. While this only meant the Malones simply relocated to one of their establishments further North, this also meant police had at long last succeeded in closing trade channel into Alabama. Certain information of these events would later be kept confidential from the public so as to avoid the likelihood of the exchange program losing their credibility and assurance of liminals safety in the state. It was decided the public is to know what they SHOULD know. The police and Mon forces working tirelessly to stop a group of vicious criminals. Acknowledgement of innocent people that lost their lives to these criminals and the justice for grieving families as they witnessed the murderers led out of court to prison. And to top it off, an exchange host who's courage led to their capture and rescue of several liminals and is the reason many more were saved from a similar fate.That's how it was painted on the surface anyway. A lot of half-truths so police and Mon can save face and simultaneously gain more favor in the public eye.But enough focusing on quasi fake news for protection of common welfare, let's get back to our main heroes.****Present Day****The morning sun bathed the entire city of Huntsville in warming, welcoming light accompanied by a refreshing breeze. August had come quicker this year. While this meant Autumn was fast approaching plenty of things besides leaves were changing. Elementary through college students beginning their new school year, farmers getting in a fresh harvest, weather changing on a dime, but the most prominent thing of all...football season. It is no exaggeration the Alabama is one state that doesn't simply play football, they freakin' live it. Commercials, a University, entire stores dedicated to merchandise, food, hell even fan clubs all created in support of Crimson Tide. Everywhere you go during the season you're bound to see or hear the phrase ''Roll Tide or Roll Tide Roll" from prideful if not overly enthusiastic fans. Granted it isn't the most well-liked team, in fact, it's the most hated college football teams in the South. Not because Crimson Tide are losers but because they WIN too goddamn always; pretty much fostering resentment in the college football world. Eh, price of victory. The outside of the Bizzell household was virtually same. All of the 4th of July decorations had been taken down and stored away for next year. This was the outside though, as within this seemingly peaceful home a storm was starting to brew.Darkness. That's all Caleb could see around him as his eyes darted back and forth erratically and nervously to find... something. Anything that would assure him that safety was possible. He opened his mouth and spoke, but no sound came out. Suddenly he felt a strong pressure around his neck and he was lifted up off the ground gasping for air and flailing desperately. A pair of fiery red eyes occompanied by the sadistic wide mouthed smile of the large hellhound Chrolla filled his vision. Fear overtook all of Caleb's senses. His gaze shift for a moment and two figures stood in the distance. He recognized them as his brother and sister and they each glared with the say hateful intensity he had seen before. Chrolla then slammed him hard to the ground. He screamed and groaned and the hound chuckled boisterously at his pain. It was then Caleb heard an audible and familiar ''click". Caleb reluctantly rose his head to the pair of black pants legs in front of him. He looked upwards to the person in front of him and grew even more fearful. Wick stood above him pointing the very same P30L at Caleb's head. Caleb's legs trembled when he made eye contact with that man. Those cold, soulless eyes that invoked unease and hopelessness. The eyes of a murderer. He grinned at Caleb as the hellhound licked her lips hungrily."What's wrong, can't stand on your own two feet?", He taunted preparing to fire. All Caleb could do was stared down that dark barrel feeling both fear and anticipation. A part of him was about to surrender to this fate, when suddenly..."DEAR!", called another voice. Caleb eyes widened to the sight of Mirabelle galloping to him. Her arms were outstretched with tears in her eyes. Wick's expression morphed to irritation as he then turned the gun in her direction aiming for her head. Caleb's legs stopped trembling as he rushed in front of Wick just a millisecond before...BANG!Caleb's eyes shot open as he jerked his upper body to sit up in bed. He gasped holding his chest. "Gah! Hah haaaah shit.", Caleb sighed exhaustedly. His body was drenched in cold sweat soaking his entire t-shirt and part of his sheets."C-caleb... came a quiet whisper that caught Caleb's attention as he noticed the slender arm on his thigh. He calmed down a bit when he saw it was only Mirabelle. She stared with those violet eyes filled distress with tears in the corners. Her attire of a sailor moon shirt that hugged her curvaceous breasts and stomachs snuggly and cloak that stopped at her upper legs. She quivered ever so often wanting to say something but felt her words lodge in her throat."Hey, morning moon pie.", Caleb uttered tiredly, "You okay?""Y-yes... I am. But you... I", she trailed choking again.Caleb sighed again wiping the sweat from his face then sat up on the beds edge, "Yeah, it's that dream again, you don't have to-""Please, don't tell me not to worry.", Mirabelle interrupted cupping his face in her hands. Caleb stared back at her and saw the anguish in her eyes, "Not as long as that pain is still there.""Can't hide much from you can I?", He replied dryly.Mirabelle looked away remembering the terrible images she seen in his dreamscape.Caleb sorrowfully glanced down to the floor, inhaled then exhaled, before giving her a stern look, " Moon pie, remember what I said about pain and what we can do about it?"Mirabelle slowly nodded before uttering, "A-acknowledge it and...learn from it in order to move forward.""That's right sweetie, and that's just what I'm going to do.", He then cupped her chin gently forcing her to look at him, "that's what WE'RE going to do. Okay?"Mirabelle blushed meeting his gaze while processing his words. She snapped out of her thoughts when he released her chin and quickly stepped to the side."But right now, I am, I need to shower and change. Haven't sweated this much since my first finals week in college.", Caleb giggled. Mirabelle joined in and the two shared an awkwardly forced laugh together to relieve. Caleb picked up his new phone to see the time, 6:45 a.m."Pretty early, don't even have to be at work until 9.", Caleb said grabbing his work shirt, beige slacks, socks, and underwear, "Eh, more time for us to spend together. Could ya wake up Lyca and Camilla for breakfast moon pie?""Of course, darling. I-is there anything you may need? I could maybe tidy your room a bit.", Mirabelle inquired devotedly."Nah it's fine, I can do it later.", Caleb replied gathering up the last of his clothes."Oh...um ok", Mirabelle uttered beaming a loving smile and he returned it before walking out. Her smile soon vanished as she once again overcome by a deep sadness. She exited the room in time to hear the shower running in the bathroom down the hall. She stared in its direction clutching her hand to ample bosom. Her heart felt like it was in a vice grips.Tears began to run down her cheeks as she tried to hold in her sobs. " I'm sorry, dear. I'm so sorry.", She whispered remorsefully shaking her head.Inside the bathroom shower, Caleb stood with his forehead pressed against the wall as the hot water ran down his head and body. He ran his hand over the now healed but plainly visible bullet wound in his shoulder and sighed. He gulped pressing it lightly with his finger and the loud 'BANG' sound followed by the agonizing feeling of red hot piece of metal stabbing into his flesh and memories of that night flashed through his mind. He sharply exhaled clenching his eyes shut then they shot open as he glanced around frantically. It took him a couple moments to realize he was still in the shower. He soon finished and stepped out to dry and get dressed.He stood in front of the mirror, wiped away the steam and stared at his reflection. He started to internally ruminate on the events of previous weeks.While the police and Mon agents were fighting against smugglers and gangsters, Caleb and the girls were busy combating the emotional, physical, and psychological ramifications of the 4th of July events. First, he had to personally pick out everyone involved in the Malone family at the police lineup. Caleb had to spend three days in protective custody for fear of him being targeted by assassins. Mirabelle and Lyca had to be watched round the clock by I.A. personnel within his home as precaution. During that time, Caleb was also questioned by bureau agents in the murders of Gangster Renalds and Fat Bastard as a suspect. Luckily, they found out there was surveillance camera attached to a light pole that captured everything that transpired on the back of the warehouse. He was soon dropped of all homicide charges much to his great relief. When he finally got to go home, he was greeted happily by not just Mirabelle and Lyca but his uncle and Vanessa as well. Hearing their worried voices, feeling their warm hugs, and seeing those looks of genuine care was the catharsis he needed at that moment to feel at peace.Then came the wave of social media posts and news reporters looking to get as much info as they could out of him, Camilla, Sterling, the devil girls, and any officer or agents even remotely involved. All for being on top of the latest craze especially when it involves liminals While Caleb was painted as hero for his deed, even receiving multiple requests for interviews on the local news, he turned them all down. His Facebook timeline was filled post from hundreds of people, some praising him, some looking for spotlight, and some straight up hateful posts that denounce him as a 'devil worshipper'. In truth, Caleb just didn't want to draw so much unnecessary attention and because he knew whatever he said they'd just twist and mold to suit however THEY wanted. Not that staying silent really stopped them much. There were even some the hounded him at work which distracted him hurting his productivity on the new project. Speaking of work, even his relationship among his co-workers. Typically, Caleb tried not to stand out much simply finishing his part of a project then going home like he was never there. But since then, talk and rumors, some good some bad, began to circulate among his colleagues and even their project manager complained about the reporters hindering productivity towards their deadline.Finally, the day of the trial of Wick and his men. Caleb, Camilla and all the devil girls, families of deceased, Mon agents, police, and even some victimized host families, were all in attendance. After hearing testimonies, running over a substantial amount of evidence, and short deliberation, all of Wick's men were sentenced 25 years in federal prison. Wick, however, due to the gravity and frequency of his crimes amounted to capital punishment. He was sentenced to death within two weeks. When asked if he had anything else to say for himself, he looked out over everyone in the court lingering a bit on Caleb, Camilla and the other devils, and said, "I am sorry but I just don't feel I'm guilty of anything." He said those words with the utmost certainty and an unwavering calm demeanor that sent a chill down the spines of some people. The judge banged the gavel and the sentence was carried. As he and the rest of his men were led out in handcuffs, Wick turned his head and met eye contact with Caleb. The latter felt a surge of fear run through him but tried hard to let that man see it. The image of Wick's cold, malicious eyes that stared into Caleb's soul burned itself into his mind.Days after the trial, things start to slowly cool down. The media gradually eased up on it's interest in the events. Caleb was able to fully take up his mantel again as Mirabelle and Lyca caretaker. It looked like Caleb could finally get back some modicum of normalcy and control in his life.Caleb exhaled sharply staring at himself in the mirror. He knew they only survived that night because of pure luck. He had no real plans or anything, he was just trying desperately to stay alive like the coward he was. And, despite what he's been told, he knew it was because of him that motel clerk, the police chief and the officers, and old man were killed. HE was the reason Wick and his men did that. Caleb glared at his reflection with self-loathing and regret. Once again started to ask himself if all of that was truly worth? Would he have been better off if he had decided to drive off in that van when he had the chance? Leave well enough alone and let it sort itself out somehow? Go back to his homestays and pretend all was well?Then he thought of Camilla, Scarlett, Hana and the other devil girls. The looks of genuine happiness, hope, and gratitude on their faces. The Facebook and Instagram posts with images of host families, some victims of the trafficking, giving him their thanks. Finally, his mind went to his Uncle Andrew, the look of pride on his face. Cousin Vanessa patting his back happily. Lyca wrapping an arm around his neck in a playful headlock. And Mirabelle, her slender arms wrapped around him with her head nuzzling his chest then looking up at him with those beautiful violet angelic eyes.He looked down at his bare chest to the black hoof mark and lightly placed his hand on it. Exhaling slowly he looked back up to his reflection and nodded."Come on, keep it together man.", He thought to himself putting on his clothes he had laid out, "For them. And for her."He walked out of the bathroom ready to take on a new day.****7:20 a.m.****Caleb was now fully dressed and made his way down the hall towards the kitchen. As he walked down the hall, he noticed a wonderful scent wafting through the air. A scent that made his stomach and his mouth water in anticipation. Entering the kitchen, the first thing he saw was Mirabelle standing near the couch staring at the kitchen. She didn't react to his presence because she was too captivated by whatever was happening in front of her.He approached Mirabelle immediately falling dead silent with wide eyes as he understood why she was in such a daze. In his kitchen, Camilla wore one of Caleb's apron (the black Darth Vader one) under a red tank top that stopped at her belly and hugged her double D breasts and blue jean skirt with brown stockings that matched her mocha brown skin and extenuated her curvaceous thighs and plump rear. Her wings were folded neatly in small of her back like a cape as her tail swayed with her hip movements. She was softly singing a song in Spanish with her back turned to them cooking something in the skillet. Next to her however, a line of animate potatoes stood up in a line hopping rhythmically one by one into the sink of running water turning itself off and on, hopping out, then getting skinned and chopped up by a couple of levitating knives before being scooped into a floating skillet and placed on a lit burner to sautee. On the counter, a few other levitating knives were busy chopping and dicing lettuce and other vegetables then sliding them into a medium bowl to be tossed by floating wooden spoons. Camilla snapped her finger creating a small yellow magic seal and the refrigerator door swung open, five large eggs came flying out, before closing. A small bowl and whisk hovered next to her and the eggs simultaneously cracked and emptied their content before being stirred up in the bowl. The shells discarded themselves in the trash as Camilla emptied the skillet full of chopped chicken into a plate. She grabbed the bowl above her and dumped the eggs into the frying pan stirring it with a spatula before dumping the chicken in with the potatoes adding a touch of olive oil."~ahh perfecto~", she hummed sweetly when she tasted a bit of the food with s fork. She turned around and was to surprised to see Caleb and Mirabelle staring at her, "Oh! Buenos Dias Senor Caleb and Senorita Mirabelle."They both nodded simultaneously not even blinking.Camilla tilted her head in confusion, "I-is something wrong? Did I do something to upset ju?!""No no, you're good. I'm just busy once again internally questioning every fundamental principle of the universe. So far, all I've come up with is that Isaac Newton was a fuckin dumbass.", Caleb dryly stated as he watched the knives slice up pieces of cheese, green pepper, and onion then a levitating bowl take the ingredients and add them to the frying pan while Camilla continued to stir."Hehehehehe Senor is a man of science to a fault. This is nothing more than a simple enchantment spell, nothing complex", Camilla snarkily grinned finishing the eggs.'Yeah you say that but still', Caleb thought with a deadpan expression before he looked at Mirabelle who was curiously staring at the salad being tossed by magic utensils."*Yawn* Mornin' everybody, something smells really good.", came the half-awake voice of Lyca. The others turned to see the she-wolf in her pajamas consisting of grey panties and grey cutoff t-shirt. Her tail swayed excitedly as she drooled bearing her fangs in a toothy half-grin. She had serious bed head with her hair sprawled out like a frilled lizard."Heh, good morning sunshine", Caleb smiled at her glancing at the completely healed scar near her ribs."Good morning Lyca, did you sleep well?", Mirabelle inquired with a smile also avoiding looking at the scar. After that night, she and Lyca realized how much they each cared about Caleb and they began bonding more over other things. Mirabelle read her books since Lyca wasn't very good at it, Lyca would help her out in the garden, and they'd enjoy talking about random topics. When Caleb, Lyca, and Camilla finally told Mirabelle about what happened to Lyca when she took off to find Caleb and how Lyca nearly died, she fainted on the spot. Although she was extremely grateful towards Camilla did (with Caleb's help), she was even more grateful towards Lyca realizing that she was the reason Caleb was alive. The two eventually started viewing each other less as romantic rival and more like close friends; almost like sisters."Shoot yeah, that was the best sleep I had in a good while.", Lyca said as she stretched out her arms and back the did a few squats, "So is the food done?""Almost, I just need to finish a few things.", Camilla grinned at Lyca before sliding the eggs onto the serving tray then turning back with stern but kind eyes, "But first, all of you are to clean yourselves right now; dis is not le casa for pigs.""I've already finished getting dressed. Lyca, Mirabelle, I've already prepared the hot water go on ahead wash up. We'll have the table set in 15 minutes.", Caleb stated as they each beamed him appreciative grins.Lyca bounded over to Mirabelle signaling her to follow "Come on Mira, can't let Chief gesture go to waste can we? Meet ya in the bath in a minute, gonna grab some clothes.", she said before taking off to her room. Mirabelle went to her room to get her some clothes when she heard Caleb speak."Alright Ms. Sartana, let me finish up the cooking.", Caleb stated walking into the kitchen raising an eyebrow when the enchanted utensils apparently stopped working to 'look' at him."Oh it's no trouble Senor, I wanted to show my thanks to ju and the others.", Camilla said."That's really nice of you, but I'm your host. It's my job to keep you ladies happy and fed with my amazing home cookin'.", Caleb in a playfully pompous tone.Camilla giggled stepping away from the stove giving him room. He grabbed one of his aprons (the white one with the words ''Chef is love Chef is life" in black) then headed over to the fridge to grab a freshly thawed steak from the fridge, a lemon, and a small bag of white rice."So how you enjoying your here so far?", Caleb inquired placing the steak on a cutting board then glancing for a knife; only for one to levitate up to him handle side up and he took it. He trimmed the fat from the steaks and put them in the frying pan. Then he filled a small pot up with water and set it to simmer."I love it here Senor. Ju, Senorita Mirabelle and Lyca, are all so welcoming and just all seem really happy together. It has been a long time since I've been apart of a real home.", Camilla responded leaning her back to the counter next to him."Glad to hear it. I'm just sorry it took so long to get you registered.", Caleb said as Camilla hung her head pensively remembering he time in Interspecies Affairs. She remembered how tedious the process was since she had to personally tell them things about her background. It didn't help that it took longer than normal to get her approved as a student. Mostly because, at the time, the exchange was dealing with a flood of other undocumented liminals brought in after the arrests and that she was still under watch for her safety from any of the Malones assassins. It took over two weeks but Camilla was finally registered in I.A.'s system. It took another week to process Caleb's host request forms for her. When she finally arrived at Caleb's residents, the second she saw him step out of the house she scooped him into another smothering hug.She sighed, "It was not too much trouble Senor. Besides, the meal ju had prepared upon my arrival was worth it.""Heh, I bet you haven't had homemade chicken risotto like that before.", Caleb smiled as he used the spatula to turn over the steak empty a bag of rice in the boiling pot, "Your reaction when you took that first bite was priceless. '~Ai ceintos Diablios Mia, so delicious~", Caleb playfully mocked her in a really bad girly Spanish accent.Camilla crossed her arms and huffed in annoyance leaning off the counter. She smirked getting a little revenge idea before swiftly grabbing a fork with her tail. She picked a piece of potato and chicken from the serving tray and moved closer to him. Caleb noticed a stopped stirring the chicken now focusing on her and how she stared down at him with half challenging half devious eyes. She brought the fork close to his face and leaned her upper body downward meet him at eye level."Why don't ju put your money where your mouth is Senor", she said in a husky voice as her breasts hung limply giving Caleb an eye full of her bountiful cleavage. Caleb gulped nervously at how close she was to him while trying his best to focus on JUST her eyes. He slowly opened his mouth, not breaking eye contact, and took the food in his mouth. His eyes widened as he chewed every bite. The potatoes were so tender with the right amount of garlic and salt. The chicken practically melted in a puddle of spicy sweetness that combined with the seasoned potato into an fire cracker of flavor. Caleb blinked rapidly stricken dumb silent trying to process the little experience. Camilla curled her lips in a satisfied devilish grin straightening her back."Well Senor?", Camilla inquired coyly.Caleb snapped back to this reality and sheepishly rubbed the back of his head, "I, uh, hehe you definitely just gave my cooking a run for it's money. What's that called?""Asado pollo y salteara patatas (sauteed potatoes and chicken), one of mi best dishes Senor.", Camilla stated proudly fanning her wings.Caleb chuckled slightly not quite understanding what she said, "It definitely shows. I can just tell you put a lot of love into it."Camilla blushed feeling her heart thump upon hearing those words."~Ohohohoho, senor~" she giggled bubbly shimmying her body in little victory dance. She stopped only to the smell of something burning."Um senor, ju should stir that rice.", Camilla pointed to the steaming pot."Shit, hang on! I got it, I got it", Caleb exclaimed grabbing a wooden spoon and stirring the pot vigorously in an attempt to salvage most of it. He then took a bowl and a white container filled with brown powder from the cabinet. He took a good portion of the rice in a bowl then mixed in some of the powder.Camilla tilted her head, "What is that ju are adding to the rice?""Protein powder. Canine liminals like Lyca need alot of protein due to their high metabolisms and active lifestyles. Plus, she's been really in to her work outs lately, so the extra protein is big help.", Caleb explained before taking more rice into another bowl and cutting the lemon in half the squeezing out the juice, "And Mirabelle likes a bit of lemon juice in hers.""You seem to know the girls well.", Camilla commented.Caleb shrugged placing the medium rare steaks on the plate for Lyca, "Guess you could say so. I've gotten to know alot about them and their cultures. Our lives together have really meshed to the point where everything we do just feels natural you know. I hope to say same about you too. We can even cook more meals together."Camilla smiled warmly and stepped closer to him then petted his head, "Gracias senor. Heh, ju know, I realized something. Ju are the first man I've ever met who's ever cooked for or offered to cook with me.""Well, I consider myself deeply honored by that fact— ", Caleb said before he flinched from something snaking it's way up from his leg, to his butt then around his lower stomach. It was Camilla's tail. He looked up at her cheeky grin and her red eyes filled with passion before leaning close. Her breasts lightly grazing his chest and arching her back allowing her shapely rear to be pushed up. Caleb could feel his cheeks heating and his throat go bone dry.Unbeknownst to them, Mirabelle was peeking around the corner watching them. A purplish mist emanating from her tail to her legs concealed her presence and erased the sound of her steps. She wore a shocked and saddened expression covering her mouth to muffle a few choked sobs.Caleb could feel his heart race faster than a Kenyan Olympic gold medalist as she blushed deeply."~I'm glad ju were my first~", she whispered huskily as her hot breath sent a chill down Caleb making him trembled.Caleb gulped trying to avert his eyes droning, "U-uhhhhh...Ms. Sartana... please this is."Camilla suddenly burst into laughter stepping away as she unwound her tail, " Bah hohohohoho eres muy guapo( you're so cute) Senor, I was only joking. It's what we succubi do, we tease. Ju aren't mad right?", She finished innocently swaying her hips with a puppy-dog pout." No, ", his voice cracked a bit much to her amusement then he audible cleared his throat, "Ahem, no it's fine. Well let's finish up and get the table sought.""Ju read my mind Senor. Do not want these eggs getting cold ohohoho", Camilla giggled quickly grabbing one serving tray and hurrying out the kitchen. She muttered something under her breath in Spanish. Her heart refused to stop pounding in her chest and she suddenly took deep breaths to calm herself. She couldn't believe she lost herself like that. Just hearing him say those sweet things she never realized she needed to hear. Things that were a bit similar to other men she had met, but his were filled with genuine love and support in them with no subversive intent behind them. It warmed her heart and soul so much she just lost it and wanted to..."Uh, Ms. Sartana, you alright?", Caleb inquired to Camilla who flinched making her wings unfold slightly and turned to see him behind her with the rest of the food."Oh, s-si senor, just thinking out loud.", Camilla chirped. He nodded letting it be and the two passed the empty hall Mirabelle once stood.They sought up the table with the delectable spread of culinary delights bringing a new life to the room. The scent of cut vegetables and fruits, and freshly prepared meat filled the room.Caleb and Camilla were busy putting down the plates and utensils at the respective places at the table. Caleb then adjusted one of the seats for Mirabelle place. As he did so, Camilla watched his movements plaintively thinking to herself. Ever since she met this man, she had new feeling brew inside of her unlike anything she had felt before. She had met plenty of men in the last hundred plus years. All of them with similar desires and vices; none of them ever making her feel less empty inside. Before meeting Caleb, she viewed all men with same apathetic filter. But now, this man, who makes her heart race with excitement, this man, who's presence alone makes her feel complete. This man who, despite his protests, showed her life. Deep down she hoped this feeling was a sign for what many succubi sought more than anything in this world.They finished and Caleb looked over the table in approval. Camilla stood behind one of the chairs gripping the wooden edge with her claws. It was a long shot, but she had to just try and tell him. She inhaled sharply and turned to him with a serious look."S-senor, I have to tell ju— ", Camilla started but was quickly interrupted."~Oh Boy, sirloin!", Lyca shouted as she came bounding into the dining room table wearing a black T-shirt with ''Avenged Seven Fold' in red letters and light grey denim shorts, "I could smell it soon as I stepped out of the bathroom. And TWO of them?!""There was a sale in the deli section the other day.", Caleb said before a black blur entered his vision and Lyca caught him in a tight hug, released him, then sat down to wolf down the first steak. Being sure to use the knife and not her claws to cut it like Caleb said, "Thanks a bunch Chief." Lyca uttered through a mouthful of meat.Caleb smiled a patted her head, "Anytime", he said before turning his attention back to Camilla, "Oh, what were you saying Ms. Sartana?"Camilla averted for a second in thought then put on a cheerful grin, "Nothing, nothing Senor, later perhaps." She then took a seat and started cutting her omlet into pieces.Caleb looked over at the empty space with the large bowl of salad, three raspberry cressants and small bowl of rice, "Hey, Lyca is Mirabelle still in the bathroom? She usually out by now."Lyca chewed a bit then swallowed with a loud gulp before answering, "She came in after I finished.. Think she was in her room looking for something to wear the whole time.""Hmm, maybe I should go check on her", Caleb said as he the recognizable sound of a utensil hitting a plate and was met by Camilla shooting him a questioning gaze, "Not like that! I'm just gonna knock on the door."Before Caleb could step foot out of the dining room, Mirabelle appeared from the hallway trodding slowly towards into the dining room."Oh, hey Moon pie I was just about to go see about ya.", Caleb grinned as she returned it a bit half-heartedly.Caleb then noticed that her eyes were a reddish-pink and immediately grew concerned."Whoa, Moon pie are you ok? You're eyes are red.", He stated cupping he face with both hands to get a better look as her cheeks flushed from the gesture. Lyca and Camilla had stopped eating and looked over at the pair.Camilla then stood up, "Let me see, I can probably heal her w-""N-no! I'm fine really.", Mirabelle stated a bit embarrassed tone , "I just...got some soap in my eyes rubbed and I rubbed them too much to get it out, that's all."Caleb's removed his hands using only one to slightly lift up her chin, "Are you sure? Your eyes are red all over, let me get you a cold towel.", Caleb was about to leave but gingerly tugged his shirt getting his attention."No, no it's fine dear. It'll go away on it's own, but thank you anyway.", Mirabelle said smiling warmly at him. Lyca grinned comfortingly before going back to her steaks.Caleb blinked skeptically turning to Camilla and nodded and she sat back down. He released his hand from her chin and gave her space to walk in, "Well alright sweetie, just make sure after breakfast you flush them out thoroughly.""Y-yes dear.", she replied before taking her place at the table.... Earlier in the bathroom...The steam from the very large bath tub filled the room as Mirabelle stood near the large counter sink mirror drying off. The purple fur on her lower half had a nice sheen. She dried her head with a towel as beads of sweat slid down from her large cream-colored mounds past her flat stomach to her nether regions. She pulled off the towel and placed it in the laundry hamper. Looking at the image in the mirror, she shuddered at how pathetic she looked. Her deep frown, baggy tear stained reddened eyes, and slumped shoulders served to reflect everything she despised about herself. She thought of what happened with Caleb and Camilla and how she stood there watching. She wanted desperately to say something to make her stop, to let her know he belonged to her. But she froze, she realized she had no grounds to say such things. She couldn't even bring herself to go to him when he needed her most. That night while the person she loved was in life threatening danger, Lyca, Sterling, everyone, including Camilla did everything they could to save him. But her, nothing, she did nothing but hide and wait.She ran back to her room tearfully lamenting on what a coward she was. He deserved better than her.The last few weeks she's entered his dreams, she could feel the trauma and pain he was afflicted with and it was tearing him up inside, but he tried his best to move on to and not look back. But it still tormented him, even in the real world. It hurt. She wanted to help him, in any way she could to make him feel at ease. It was the least, or rather the only thing she could do.Mirabelle sighed to herself as she buttoned her lavender blouse over a plain light purple t-shirt tucking the hem into the grey cloak on her bottom half. She opened the door of the bathroom and stepped. A loud noise of someone screaming, 'Oh boy sirloin!', made her jump out of her skin. She calmed herself realizing it was Lyca and giggled dispassionately for not being used to her excited outbursts by now. She put on a smile and made for the dining room.*****8:15 a.m.*****Breakfast went by moderately as they enjoyed their time together. They enjoyed some small talk, partially geared towards Camilla to get to know the others a bit more. Mirabelle didn't say much, of course, or even really look Camilla in the face. Caleb and Lyca just wrote it off as nervousness and helped her out in telling things about herself. Lyca stretched standing up then went into the living room to continue watching a new show on Netflix she started enjoying called 'Sons of Anarchy'. Caleb was gathering up the dishes and serving trays as Camilla sat finishing the last of her food. Caleb reached for Mirabelle's plates but she quickly piled them up and got up from her seat."Oh, it's fine dear, I've got them. I can help you with dishes as well.", She said wanting to be helpful."Oh, thank you", Caleb replied.Mirabelle followed him to the entrance when suddenly she felt something restrain her front legs. She gave a sharp, startled cry as she dropped three of the plates and they shattered on the floor. She was on her front legs looking at shattered mess of glass on the regretfully. Camilla turned her head in surprise and instinctively jumped up to aid."Whoa, Mirabelle are you ok?!", Caleb said placing the tray on a nearby stand then stepping around the carefully glass. Mirabelle saw the worry in his face and nodded remorsefully.Lyca came sliding in, "Mira?! What's wr-oh! Hey, you're not hurt are you?""N-no, i'm okay.", Mirabelle knew her words were filled with concern but still felt them sting her to the coreCaleb kneeled down to help her up and she reluctantly accepted, "You sure, no cuts or anything? That was quite a spill.""Jes, an injury is still an injury. Even smaller ones shouldn't be ignored, here Senor I can take c-", Camilla said summoning a small blue magic seal but was interrupted by Mirabelle."N-no! I mean, i-i'm sorry but I'm fine, really. I don't have a single scratch on me.", Mirabelle finished coldly, "But I broke some of your good plates"Caleb lightly petted the top of her head "I'm just glad you're fine, they're just plates. But don't move until I sweep up all this broken glass.""That won't be necessary Senor.", Camilla said confidently before facing the pile of sharps extending one hand and making a figure eight with the other. A yellow magic seal with an infinity symbol appeared and the shards started glowing same color. The floated off the floor and instantly reformed themselves back into a stack off whole plates, as if they were never broken.Caleb, Lyca, and a Mirabelle stared at the plate in amazement then collectively turned to her."Que?", she uttered confused by their behavior. In a flash, Lyca appeared in front of her starry eyed and grinning excitedly."That's so cool. What did you do?", Lyca stated bouncing in one spot."Yeah, that was pretty awesome. What is it like a fix'it spell like the one in Harry Potter?", Caleb asked staring at the plates intrigued."Please do not compare our use of the mystic arts to that self-deluded, vapid, libidinous twaddle Senor.", She said in annoyance, "But it is, in a sense restoring something to a previous state in it's history. Think of it like, rewinding time."All their jaws dropped before Caleb said, "You can control time too! Did the laws of physics just stop caring when your species came into existence?!"Ignoring his question, Camilla decided to clarify, "That spell only works on inanimate objects. It doesn't work on people."Caleb nodded thinking to himself, 'wow, that'll save me some cash on repairs.'"Also, it won't work on the same object more than three times.", Camilla added.Nevermind."Ok, looks like everything's good in here.", Lyca candidly spoke side stepping out of the room to finish the rest of her show. MirabelleCaleb glanced at his phone and his eyes widened, "8:20 already? Man time moves fast. Let me finish up these dishes before I go to work.", he said grabbing the plates on the floor only for them to levitate out of his grasp and on to the serving."Esta bien( it's alright) Senor, it's not that much. I'll take care of it.", Camilla smiled assuringly as the entire tray and it's contents levitated in front of her."Really? I have time, you already did most of the cooking. It's the least I can do as your host.", Caleb said.Camilla felt that warmness again, "That's sweet of ju Senor but ju have to get going. Go do your, um engineering...stuff."She left the room with the enchanted dishware floating behind her like a balloon. She glanced curiously back to Mirabelle who stood like a statue.Caleb shook his head before turning his attention to Mirabelle. She cradled her arms cast her hooded gaze to the floor, appearing to be deep in thought."Moon pie?", Caleb said and she snapped out of her thoughts greeting him with an attentive smile, "You sure you're ok?""Yes dear, as I said before.", Mirabelle nodded."Good, because that was just an accident. We all make mistakes, I wasn't mad, so try not to dwell on it, okay. Besides Camilla fairy godmothered the plates, so it's all good."Mirabelle giggled slightly at the comment, "Ok, dear."Caleb scratched the spot on her ear and cooed from the gesture, "Alrighty, I'm gonna grab my laptop and my blueprints then I'll be heading off.""Ok. I-I love you.", Mirabelle uttered soft enough just for him to hear. Caleb responded by gingerly kissing her forehead."I know", he whispered in her ear before leaving for his office room. She touched the spot watching him leave before her expression dissolved into a sad frown.******10 minutes later*******Lyca leaned forward on the couch engrossed in the episode as she clutched Bain( her stuff beowolf grimm from RWBY) to her chest. There was a knock at the front door and her ears twitched from the sound."I got it!", She paused the episode and wnt to answer the door. Standing outside was a Caucasian human woman in a uniform consisting of a blue suit jacket with white dress shirt underneath and navy blue slacks. She carried a black file case with the Interspecies Affairs logo on the front. Lyca and the critically eyed the woman sniffing curiously as the latter cleared her throat never changing her diligent expression."Good morning! I'm looking for a Mr. Caleb Beezell, are you one of his charges?", The woman spoke with a thick Southern accent as Lyca stopped sniffing and was about to say something before she heard Caleb's voice."Right here, yes she is, and it's pronounced 'Bizzell'", Caleb answered with slight annoyance near the end then petting Lyca's heard nonverbally telling her 'Thank you, I got it.' and she scampered off to the living room."How can I help you ma'am?", Caleb inquired."Good morning! My name is Jacqueline Pelt of the Interspecies Affairs branch of Alabama. I will be looking after you charges while you perform your duties as an employee.", The woman explained showing her license and form with authorization seal.Caleb looked at both forms of identification nodding in approval, "Ok, please come in. What happened to Paul?"Jacqueline stepped inside, "He was temporarily assigned to Japan to assist a man there with his former charges. All of whom the man is currently married to. ""Good Lord, eight?! Don't know if that's impressive or insane.", Caleb replied inciting a chuckle from her."You know, I have to say it's nice to meet the man who helped restore our organization integrity.", She said with a smile.'ah geez, here we go', Caleb thought not wanting to have that conversation."There have been plenty of host families and liminal we've rescued that would love to meet you. Perhaps we can schedule something?", She asked inquisitively."Thanks, but no. I honestly want to just move on from that mess. Please?", Caleb stated melancholically much to her surprise. Then something else caught her attention."Oh, hello.", She said looking over Caleb shoulder and waving. Caleb turned around to see Mirabelle standing behind him."Oh! U-um, h-hello, my name is Mirabelle M-Marequine. H-how and w-who are you?", Mirabelle stuttered speaking to Ms. Jacqueline. Caleb watched her both carefully mentally crossing his fingers as Jacqueline approached her."Hello , I'm from I.A. and I will looking after you and the others until your host returns", Jacqueline said extending her hand to Mirabelle.Mirabelle inhaled deeply then shook her hand, "Nice to meet you and thank you for your help." Caleb peaked over Jacqueline giving Mirabelle a thumbs up.."Perdoméme (excuse me)", Camilla stated catching their attention, "but is it really necessary to have an agent watch us for a few hours. We are capable of looking after our home.""Ah, you must be Ms. Sartana the newest resident here. I'm sorry but only exchange students who have been members for one year and pass the citizenship exam are not required to have chaperones.""That is a rather arbitrary set of rules.", Camilla stated plainly."A little bit yes, but they're necessary. There a still plenty of liminals and humans with rather bad intentions.", Jacqueline stated giving her a knowing look and Camilla crossed her arms not to dignify a response.Caleb interjected walking out for the doorway, "Alright then, I trust you to look after them. See you at 4 girls! You have my number, call me if anything happens", he said before closing the door. He then noticed a white Camry parked next to his grey Honda. It's likely her's. As he walked to his car, the door suddenly swung open and out came."Wait, Mr. Bizzell I forgot to tell you Agent Sterling is going to be here later to discuss something important with you."Caleb raised an eyebrow, "Ok then, thanks for letting me know.""Hehehe, well now look at that.", She said looking away at his house. He turned around to see Mirabelle and Lyca hands pressed to the glass with worried even slightly fearful looks on their faces. Caleb waved to them beaming a confident grin that said everything will be fine. Camilla came up from behind and touched their shoulders and gave them both caring smiles. Lyca returned her own and Mirabelle...averted her gaze in discomfort. Mirabelle and Lyca stepped away from the window with Mirabelle giving one last glance back before going off about their business. Camilla waved him goodbye.'They're never gonna let me out of their sight again.', Caleb thought fervently before stepping into his vehicle and, starting it, back out of the driveway to see enter his home, then driving off."Well, I'm gonna go work out.", Lyca stated before going off to her*****Work*****A large 4-story tall building stood in the Eastern section of the city just 22 miles away from Caleb's residence. There were a multitude of darkened windows covering much of the exterior with spots of white and burgundy walls covering certain areas. The entrance was a revolving door under a large burgundy canopy structure right next to it was a toll gate to an underground parking lot. A large triangular sign of arrows that read 'H.O.D. Dynamics' in Orange and Black color.Inside was a research and development center. It was typical office filled with cubicles with computers and standard office supplies (copiers, staplers, ect.) but there were private rooms were teams could discuss progress and data on projects. Caleb was inside one of these room explaining his blue prints on the newly refined turbine structure to his team members. The five of them, including their supervisor Rodney, sat at the large fold in table with three laptops and folders cluttering much of it, listening to him intently."And so, if we use blades with a tungsten-steel based alloy, it will reduce the energy loss from friction on the axial shaft by 30% and keep well within the range of our budget.", Caleb finished exhaling slowly and waited for a response.Rodney stood and approached him, "My man!", he stated before repeated slapping Caleb on the back in praise, "I had a feeling you'd find a way to work around out piggy bank of a budget!""Yes, I never even considered air resistance could be minimized by using to metals with low electronegativity. You're something else Caleb.", a tall Indian man with a goatee and glasses said in astonishment."Thanks Raj, but it just is what it is.", Caleb stated rubbing his back of the soreness."Ah come on Cal, you gotta be learn to accept praise man.", Rodney stated to which Caleb shrugged.A short blonde woman wearing a red button with a white capital 'A'(The Crimson Tide symbol) on her white dress shirt spoke next, "So how DID you come up with that idea any?"Caleb paused for a second thinking to himself, "I...thought of it in a dream?"A few of them were surprised by his answer and the blonde girl was about to inquire further before…"IT'S HIGH NOON.", came a masculine voice accompanied by classic western sounds. It was Rodney's alert on his phone."Oop 12:30, that's the lunch bell kids. Who's up for Chick-fil-a?", Rodney stated joking waggling his phone in hand. Caleb and the other gave him a dry stare."You really need to see a doctor.", the blonde girl said.After a few more hilarious exchanges, they exited the room, locked it, and made their way through the office. As Caleb made his way to the elevator, he couldn't help but overhear the whispers of people as he passed by.'That's him huh?''yeah, I heard he even killed some of those gangsters''Willing to take human lives, but he'll save a bunch of Satan's minions? He's got to be some kind of heathen.''That's nothin', I here he's even living with one of 'em.''Definitely ain't no Christian. I seen him in town with this centaur right? But it's dark purple with like mist around it's tail and it's always following him from behind.''Maybe it's some kind of demon horse making him act that way.''and who's to say those demons at that hotel didn't manipulate him into doing those things no sane person would.There words cut him, not deeply, but enough to feel the sting. He inhaled and exhaled slowly as the elevator open for his group. More rumors have circulated around the building. It's gonna be another long day.****Back at home****Mirabelle was in her room looking over some of her figurines. After ensuring Sailor Mercury was free of any dust and defects, her attention fell on the Sailor moon plushy Caleb won for her. She solemnly looked at it before picking it up. She gripped the side of it sadly clenching her eyes. Alot of 'what ifs?' ran through her mind. What if she didn't carelessly leave it behind? What she stayed with him and asked Lyca to retrieve it for her? What if she wasn't so selfish? She whimpered before hugging the plushie to her chest like security blanketDown the hall across from the bathroom, the sound of strained grunts could be heard from Lyca's room. The inside of her room was decorated in a very rugged, rustic outdoorsy theme with wood paneled walls and floors. A deer head was mounted on the wall next to the door; a momento of her first hunt. Her camo patterned dresser had stuffed taxidermy bobcat on top but half of her clothes were scattered around the room anyway. Her bed was a pile of sheets and various animal furs. On the far end of the room, was a miniature gym with a treadmill, a bench press with several weights, and a pull-up bar. Lyca grunted through gritted teeth doing her pull ups with 50lb weights attached to each leg. With trembling arms, she finished the last pull-up before landing to the floor. She wanted and gasped as sweat ran from her lean biceps, past her rock hard abs, to her toned thighs.'Damn it, still not close enough.', She thought frustratedly. She shut her eye and images of that large fire eyed dog filled her mind. It was strong, too strong for her to take on her own and Chief had to protect HER instead. Hell, she nearly DIED if it weren't for Chief and Camilla. She opened her eyes again with renewed vigor. She will get stronger, she will protect the one person who treated her like an equal. She had to.After drinking (or lapping) from her cold water bottle, she got up the treadmill turning it up to 120 mph.****Chick-fil-a****The group sat outside on the restaurant patio tables enjoying their lunch. Raj and the blonde crimson tide girl chatted while Rodney, Caleb, and the others were engaged in their own stimulated conversation."No, no, no, and no. Total BS man", Rodney shook his head emphatically."Come on man, it totally makes sense.", The short Caucasian man with hazel colored hair said."There is no way on God's green earth that's true. It's bare a conspiracy theory", Rodney said."Dude of course vampires created twilight as way to make humans less afraid of them. Thus, more likely for us to allow them to have our blood. What teenage girl wouldn't if a real one came strolling up to her now?""Ok, what are you smoking? Give me some, and turn in your resignation letter", Rodney stated in mock seriousness.Caleb simply listened to their back and forth. Then noticed his drink was empty so went inside to refill. It was not a flimsy excuse to avoid being dragged into the conversation. On his way back, he placed his wallet in his back pocket then checked his phone noticing a few texts from cousin Vanessa and scrolled through a few giggling to himself. He failed to see the man walking and bumped into him spilling his drink on him. His grey shirt was wrinkle with a red stain and his dingy pants had holes in the knees. He was skinny, looked like he needed a shave, and reeked of cigarettes."Gahh, What the hell's your problem man?! Watch where the fuck your goin'!", The man shouted attracting the attention of other people on the patio including Caleb's group."I'm really sorry, that's my fault. Let me get you some napkins or something to—", Caleb apologized but was interrupted."I don't need your help, just move it dumbass!", he said before shoulder bumping Caleb walking past towards the restaurant entrance. Caleb failed to notice the man slip his wallet from his pocket. He brushed himself off and turned and squatted to pick up his phone. Suddenly, a gust of wind picked up around the restaurant and then spike in speed and ferocity. Trash whipped around, table parasols shook violently, and some vacant chairs were flipped over. While everyone shielded their eyes from the strong winds, Caleb then heard a startled shout past the whistling winds. He looked up and turned to see the man from earlier sitting flat on his rear groaning as he held his lower back. He didn't notice his wallet tumbling towards his feet and stop at his heel. The winds immediately stopped, much to everyone's confusion and relief. Caleb stood up and saw his wallet on the ground then picked it up. He inspected wondering how it fell out of his pocket. He mentally shrugged, placed it back inside, then went back to his table ignoring the rude man from earlier as he shakily stood up."That was some bizarre weather, even for down in Alabama.", Rodney stated picking some fries that had spilled in his lap as Caleb sat back down.The man from earlier walked inside the restaurant with several new holes in different area in his clothesAfter their lunch time weather phenomenon, Caleb and his associates returned to the office to present an update on their progress to the project manager. The rest of the day went by without much cause for alarm. Of course, Caleb still heard a bit of gossip about him but most of it was tolerable to a degree. He really hoped this would blow over soon.Finally, it was 4 'o clock and Caleb could finally punch out for the day. As Caleb was walking to his car, he noticed something attached to his car door. It was white square banner with a red pentagram drawn on it and the words 'devil loving heathen' also in red."Tch, fucking…", Caleb sneered before tearing it off his door and throwing it away in a nearby trash. He got inside his car and started the ignition. He gripped the steering wheel hard, looked around to make sure the windows were all up and no one was around. Inhaling sharply for a few seconds, and then proceeded to scream his head off as loud as he could muster. When he was done relieving himself, he took a few shout breaths and cleared the scratchiness from his throat. "Time to go.", he uttered wearily pulling out of the parking space and to the toll gate. He scanned his ID pass and the bar raised allowing him to leave.*****20 minutes later*****Caleb had just gotten off the freeway and turned onto the street to his neighborhood. As his house came into view, he noticed Sterling's car parked in his driveway. It was then the memory of…what's-her-name?, Jocelyn?...telling him that Sterling had something important to discuss with him.'I wonder what he wants to talk about. Hopefully it's something good, I do not want any more shit in my show.', Caleb thought sarcastically as he pulled into the driveway next to Sterling's car putting his vehicle in park.After locking the doors, he walk through the driveway up to the front door and unlocked it with an audible clunk. He then heard loud, thumping footsteps. He cracked his neck and rotated the stiffness his shoulders physically preparing himself for tor what was to come next. He removed to key, cracking the door slightly, then it immediately flew open revealing Lyca standing there brimming with joy as her tail wagged excitedly."Chief's back!", Lyca exclaimed before leaping into very tight hug nuzzling his chest. He managed to pry one arm out of her grip and lightly petting her head at first, then evolved to rapid patting on her shoulder. She looked up a bit puzzled then saw his face desperate gasping for air and immediately released him stepping back, "Oh, sorry about that chief. Got a little too excited…again hehehe".Caleb sharply inhaled then coughed a few times, " *A-A-Ahem*, No problem. I pretty used to it. Hoo child.", he said rotating the stiffness from his shoulders."Welcome home dear. How was work today?", Mirabelle who was sitting on the other end of living room couch reading manga."It was pretty good. They liked my design of the turbine blade at least, so that's a win.", Caleb said walking over to the couch with Lyca passing him then leaping over said couch to sit down.Agent Sterling appeared from the kitchen eating a sandwich he made. He ate the last but brushed his hands with a nearby paper towels. Then popped open a can of Dr. Pepper.'This guy.', Caleb thought with a vexing look."Ah good evening, Mr. Bizzool!", He said taking another sip from the can before placing it on the counter, " Also, you're out of Dijon mustard.""It's Bizzell", he growled, "and that depends on what you call smooth. As for the mustard, I recommend subway next time.""Heh, fair enough.", Sterling shrugged.Camilla then appeared walking down the hallway carrying what looked like a large sketch pad. She smiled at Caleb feeling her cheeks heat up a bit."Buenos noches, Senor, happy to see ju ", she said"Hey there Ms. Sartana. What's that you're carrying?", he saidCamilla held up her sketch pad, "Oh, it's some of my drawings.""You're an artist?", Caleb inquired"I dabble, but I wouldn't say i'm a professional. I can show you some time.""I'll take you up on that. So, what did you guys do today?", Caleb said turning to Mirabelle and Lyca.Lyca sat on her knee leaning towards Caleb, "We had a lot of fun. Mirabelle and I played that game 'Injustice 2' you bought last week. I tried getting Camilla into it, but she rage quit after the first 20 minutes.""Quien Liedo, I was not enraged it was only a silly game.",Camilla huffed."You nearly snapped the controller in half.", Lyca said raising an eyebrow."W-well that's...it's not my fault those buttons are so complicated. I literally just kept pressing them fast and random.", Camilla retorted."Then she stomped off and to her room to sulk.", Lyca smirked snorting a laugh."I went to mediate! I felt my mana beginning to leak out as dark magic and had to cal-I mean, regulate it!", Camilla retorted with crossed arms looking away in a huff.Caleb chuckled at them glancing over to Mirabelle who had her head buried in the manga taking occasional peaks at Camilla. He tilted his head at her before Sterling spoke up."Well, Ms. Sartana, I see you've adjusted to living here quickly.", He said as she and everyone else gave him surprised stares to which he rolled his eyes, "Yes, i'm still here."Caleb stepped up to him, "Oh yeah, you had something important to talk to me about?""Yes, a few things actually. First off, Jakob capital punishment has been moved up to three days from now.", Sterling saidCaleb and the girls, especially Camilla froze at hearing that. To be honest, Caleb really wanted to think about it but he and the rest new that it would resurface soon."Oh.", Caleb said. That's all he could say.Sterling finished the last of his sandwich and wiped his hands with a paper towel, "Yes and there's more. It concerns you AND your houseguests as well."Caleb and the others stiffened as their expressions became more serious."We've been continually tracking any remaining dealers operating in Alabama for the Malone family. Many have been detained, but there are likely still plenty of associates of the Malones working to carry out their activities. That even includes blacklist hitmen.", Sterling said the last part with a hint of malice.Caleb eyes widened in realization, "What...exactly are you trying to say?""I'm saying, one of these hitmen, amatuer or otherwise, may make an attempt on your life at some point. They may even come after one of your homestays.", Sterling answered with very serious tone.Lyca, Camilla, and Mirabelle all wore horrified expressions. Of course they were worried about themselves, but they were even more worried for Caleb.Caleb felt his heart rate quicken as fear began to creep up his spine. He could feel another attack coming on and began to take deep breaths. Mirabelle got up from her position went to Caleb. She hugged his arm weakly looking up with a scared but compassionate expression. Lyca joined them with a worried but determined expression. Camilla caressed his back attempting to calm him with a supportive but slightly uneasy expression."I-I'm fine Moon Pie, all of you.", Caleb said to them giving a reassuring grin. Sterling watched them with an approving grin before continuing."We came up with a number of solutions. The obvious would have been to relocate you and put you in witness protection, but seeing as how you've pretty much been trending on social media for the last few weeks that was ruled out. We have limited resources and the Malones have station throughout most of South Central. But, we do have another solution. We have enlisted a highly skilled Mon agent that will watch over you for any suspicious characters.", he statedLyca and Camilla stepped away from Caleb with offended expressions."Excuse me, we don't need some fancy agent! I'm more than fast and strong enough to stop them before they can even touch Chief!", Lyca said flexing her muscles and brandishing her claws."I don't intend to brag, buuut I am proficient 5 different forms of martial arts and I am well-versed in the mystic arts of conjuration, enchantments, charms, and even spirit manipulation. I refuse to allow anyone to harm the man who saved my life.", Camilla stated trying not to sound boisterous.Mirabelle looked at Camilla and Lyca both of them surrounded in a strong, confident aura and she looked down insecurely.'Well ladies, the problem with that is you two are both labeled as students of the exchange, as in, not FULL citizens of the country. Which means any acts of physical violence inflicted upon a person is grounds for punishment and possible deportation. Regardless, of who instigated said violence", he said bursting their collective bubbles, "Mon agents, on the other hand, are granted permission to use forceful methods on humans and non-humans and are not restricted from certain areas."Camilla and Lyca both scoffed at the idea that anyone would be better up to the job."Then, who is this person that's supposed to be protecting us anyway.", Caleb inquired before the loud whistle and howling of wind outside the house caught his and everyone else's attention.Sterling walked to the door with a knowing grin on his face, "Well, it looks like they've arrived."Caleb and the girls immediately shot confused glares at the door, 'They?', all of them thought collectively.The front door suddenly burst open bringing a powerful whirlwind that whipped through the entire room sending small objects flying around. Caleb and the girls shielded themselves from the violent winds even struggling to keep balance. Finally, the winds died down and Caleb was the first to uncover his head to see what happened. They living room was a mess but then his eyes widened to the sight of three girls standing on his coffee table in dramatic poses. They were all dresses in green, red, and gold kunoichi-style outfits complete with sandals and white thigh high stockings. They each had lime green hair with fur on their bushy tail, slender arms, and small ears. The tallest one had a long pony tail with bangs covering her left eye and very curvaceous figure with muscular thighs, breasts that could give Camilla's a run for her money, and plump rear. She wore a stoic expression and had long scythe-like protrusion extended from the back of her wrists that looked duller than a spoon. The second tallest had a slightly less curvaceous with shapely legs, a flat butt, and C-cup breasts. She wore a more mischievous expression and had shorter scythes that looked sharp enough to cut the wings off the back of a fly in mid flight. The shortest one had a more petite frame almost similar to Lyca's, except while Lyca had clearly defined abs and muscles, she had softer even childlike features. She wore a content childish grin and held in her delicate hands a small pot with an odd liquid inside."Bringing the golden wind of change into your future.", said the tall one"Cutting down all dark foes that oppose us", spoke the second tallest"and Driving away all pain and fear.", spoke the shortest"Strength of a might hurricane! I am Ein!", The tall one stated crossing her arms in front of her."Swiftness of the windy plains! I am Zwei!", the second tallest said crouching in a ninja run position."Serenity of the doldrum! I am Drei!, the shortest state"Now rejoice, for the Zyklon Sisters are here!", they all state simultaneously striking a different pose.Caleb, Mirabelle, and Camilla stared blankly taking in and trying to process what the hell was happening.Lyca had stars in her eye admiring how cool they all looked.Sterling stepped next to the posing girls, "Mr. Bizzell, meet your new bodygaurds."Caleb blinked slowly collecting his thoughts before finally speaking, "Greeeat...please tell them to get off my damn table."Writer's note:Ohhhh boy, this took a while, again. Finals were tough as balls but I managed to finish this semester in college strong with As and a couple of solid low Bs in all my classes. I hope you all had a merry Christmas. I sure did, and a pretty good birthday as well. Got plenty of birthday money, RDR2, Assassins Creed Odyssey, shirts, and a whole lotta love.Now this chapter was meant to go up on Big J's birthday, but I was pretty occupied with celebrating with my family and kinda lost track of time. Luckily, I was 95% finished so I didn't lose TOO much ground. Honestly, I felt this chapter could left a few holes that needed filling( phrasing) and hope to do so next release( also phrasing). And with Camilla apart of the family, my Creatures of the Night aka Lunar Trifecta is complete. The Dark Horse, The Werewolf, and The Demon/Also, I'd like to thank everyone for their votes on the new monster girl. Kamaitachi for the win! Figures I get this Trifecta to go with my OTHER trifecta.Lastly, I got a few complaints over two things: My infrequent updates and the decision to do Character info stats.To the first complaint, give me a break, life is tough. I'm juggling college, work, a few bills, AND family issues. Besides if I'm taking a long time to update, that only means I have something good brewing. Have a little patience guys.To the second complain, yes I actually agree. I thought it was cool at first but later realized maybe it was a bad idea to make a chapter solely for character info. I'll probably include them in the main story at some point, though.Ok, that's literally all I got right now. Make sure to follow, fav, and review. Merry late Christmas and a Happy New Year! As always…Peace Fam!
  
    Chapter Text
    Chapter 12: Full Disclosure*****6 hours earlier*****In a large office within the second floor of Huntsville Interspecies Exchange building, Agent Sterling was seated at the head of rectangle oak wood, marble top table with 4 black leather seats on both sides. He was on his laptop setting up the files preparing to be displayed on the presentation board behind him. There was a large window that gave full view over much of the city with the blinds block much of the light. A small coffee machine with leftover brew was sitting next to a large potted fern. In the middle of the table was an open box of a dozen assorted Krispy Kreme donuts. A dainty hand reached across to grab a couple while half her body pressed against the surface. Next to her, both her sisters sat in the preceding chairs next to her. Both giving disapproving stares."Zwei, please it's poor manners to reach across the table like that.", Ein, the strongest of the trio, scolded her sister. Her long dull blades retracted neatly into her furred arms."Come on sis, you were such a hurry to not be late we didn't eat any breakfast. I'm wasting away to nothing over here.", Zwei, the sibling with the sharpest blades, crooned in a melodramatic voice doing a fainting pose. Her blades tucked inside her fur for safety reasons, "How am I supposed to concentrate if I don't have the proper nutrition.""We are in a meeting, sister, try to take this seriously!", Ein stated in annoyance."Excuse me.", Sterling called to them but was ignored."Ah sis lighten up. Think of it this way, to NOT eat them would be an insult to the starving people of the world. Are you really going to be so unappreciative of how blessed you are ...in more ways than one?", Zwei finished gesturing up and down her sisters body.Ein blushed in embarrassment and frustration. She put her finger out to offer her rebuttal but was interrupted when Drei, the sister with most dexterous fingers, reached across the table and grabbed a lemon creme filled donut while giving them a deadpan yet somewhat cheeky stare. A small medicine gourd attached at her waist."She's right you know. Besides, I believe your new diet is working, you've earned a cheat day.", Drei said before licking a dollop of cream from her finger."Excuse me, ladies?", Sterling stated but ignored again.Ein paused taken aback by the sudden complement before adopting a chipper tone, "Oh, well...t-thank you Drei. Maybe I will have one.""Of course. Some people hardly give themselves ONE cheat day, let alone three in one week."A took a second for the other two to register the comment before Zwei started giggling and Ein wore a mortified expression blushing again in frustration clinching her teeth."Rrrroasted!", Zwei jeered at Ein who shot her agitated, flustered glare followed by a strained growl."HEY!", Sterling shouted slamming his open palm hard against the table. The wind weasels jumped in their chairs face their attention on a fuming Sterling with different degrees of fright. He sharply inhaled and exhaled before continuing, "If you're all done with your shtick, I'd like to get this briefing started. Now turning your attention to the board behind me."Sterling pressed a button on his computer then grabbed a small grey remote. He pointed at the board and the entire thing lit up before showing a presentation.A screen with ICEP's logo appeared before panning over to next slide. A slide with a light grey background and Caleb's picture in the top left corner appeared. Ein, Zwei, and Drei collectively raised an eyebrow at his picture."This man is Caleb D. Bizzell. Age 24, born December 10th, 1993, to the Joseph and Marian Bizzell, two older siblings Ladarious and Malissa Bizzell. He is a host of the Interspecies Exchange program. Originally, the family lived in Tuscaloosa and led a relatively normal life; father was a banker and mother a licensed child psychiatrist. Apparently, Caleb was a bit troublesome in his early teens. He had been caught shoplifting on two separate occasions and assaulted a few students that were bullying him with a baseball bat. This caused friction between himself and his siblings but his parents and even his uncle tried to be patient with him. It was his uncle that decided it would be better that he attended his daughter's school in Gadsden instead. Overtime, his parents and uncle saw a change in him. Even his grades and temperament greatly improved. This change was met with tragedy however, when an unfortunate interstate traffic accident led to the death of both his parents.", Sterling paused to change the slides as the trio wore solemn expressions upon hearing the last part."Afterwards, he moved to Huntsville to attend Alabama A&M and eventually graduated. He's one of the victims of motel incident in Cullman and played a large role in the arrest of several liminal taffickers."Drei stood up and raised her hand, "You mentioned he was a host earlier, does that mean he's a host to liminals?"Sterling gave a puzzled look towards Ein, "Is she being sarcastic or was she just not paying attention?""Knowing her probably both.", Ein commented dryly."But, yes he is a host to three different liminals at the moment. I was just about to get to them.", Sterling finished with a clear hint of impatience."S-sorry sir, we WON'T interrupt anymore.", Ein said glaring at Drei who returned it by taking out a pen and notepad in a mock gesture of diligence.Sterling changed the slide and a screen with a purple background displayed a picture of Mirabelle in the top left corner that alternated between showing just her face to different angles of her whole body. The right side displayed her general information." This is Mirabelle Marequine, student of the Interspecies Exchange. Age 21, born September 20th 1996 to Madeline Marequine, father unknown, and no siblings. She's a subspecies of the Centaur race known as a Nightmare. All information regarding her species was previously unknown but thanks to her host we've compiled a considerable amount of data. They're a Centaur race gifted with extraordinary supernatural abilities, but more proficient in the art of dream manipulation and astral projection. Apparently, they, along with all Centaur we're once made up of one enormous warrior clan called The Great Harras that roamed much of Europe."The triplets listened with different degrees of interest."Over time, many female Centaur began to develop an affinity for magic and abandoned their warrior upbringing. Their overall appearance was greatly altered as a result. This created a bit of an dispute among the centaur that still followed their militaristic traditions and worship of the primary Olympian gods of war. They viewed the magic users as heretics, cowards, and apostates. To escape persecution, the Nightmares and other centaur subspecies left the clan altogether forming their own clans, with varying cultures, religions, practices, and taboos. Ms. Marequine, like all members of her clan, are strongly opposed to violence and have extremely timid, nervous, skittish personalities. Their only means of defense is either retreating or manipulating the dreams of their attacker and using their worst fears to instill innate fear of them. Her clan appears to be nomadic, somehow traveling throughout all of Europe nearly undetected. Lastly, She apparently has a tradition among her people where they mark a person they've become greatly attached to with hoof shaped stamp. Furthermore, the stamp becomes darker as they become closer to each other.""Ms. Marequine originally joined the exchange branch in Rome but due to an altercation with a few centaur of the original clan, decided to transfer to the U.S. branch. Upon arriving here, she bounced between homes in order to find a...more suitable host."Sterling then changed the slide. This one had a light blue background with alternating picture of Lyca. Zwei cocked her read raising an intrigued eyebrow at Lyca image."This is Lyca Kessler, student of Interspecies Exchange. Age 18, born April 10, 1999. Identity of mother and father, unknown but at least 14 siblings with her as the youngest. She belongs to a Werewolf class of the kobold species. Specifically, she's of the gray wolf class. She grew up in the Eastern Mountainous territory in Montana among her pack consisting of 50 individuals. Her's is one of thirteen Werewolf packs in the United States and, like others around the world, they live in complex hierarchical social structures similar to normal wolf pack. The Alpha elite dictate everything, Betas are advisors to Alpha and enforce corporal punishment on lower levels, Delta are servants to Alpha and Betas but have more freedoms than Omega, and Omega are the lower class that receive the most harassment and fewer resources in the pack. Ms. Kessler was the Omega of her pack.Ein reaches for the box for a donut only, to her surprise, for it to be completely empty. She turned to Zwei to see her happily munching the last of the delicacies. Zwei shot her a smug grin mouth full of cream as Ein puffed her cheeks to hold back her defeated whimpers and tears forming. Drei poked her shoulder getting her attention then handed her a raspberry filled donut wrapped in a napkin. Ein lit up in delight before snagging and enjoying the treat."Ms. Kessler", Sterling continued, "like many of her species, are highly social, highly aggressive and territorial, and possess higher physical capabilities and tactical intelligence compared to most kobold. They have highly competitive spirits by nature and will challenge each other either in combat or tests of skill, strength, speed, and cunning. Consistent victories and losses seem determines their rise and fall in their hierarchy. What's more, they have good morals and practice good sportsmanship. They despise cheating so much they've been known kill those caught in the act on the spot."Ms. Kessler was found by MON agents, very malnourished and in need of medical treatment for fresh injuries. She had attempted to leave her pack and was immediately beset by her superiors. She remained in I.A. care for six months before being allowed to join the exchange program. Unfortunately, her first host was involved in some illegal activity; namely liminal fighting and heroin smuggling and was later apprehended."Sterling paused and glanced over to the trio. They nodded in unison signalling for him to continue.He changed the slide over to one with a magenta background and an alternating picture of Camilla in the top left corner of the screen."This is Camilla...", Sterling inhales trying not fumble this, " de Alma Hermosa Sartana (nailed it) and is one of our newer students to the exchange program records and one of our more complex cases. According to background information she herself graciously provided, she was born November 23rd, 1835 making her a little over 180-years-of age.The triplets gave incredulous glances to one another. They heard succubi had naturally long lifespans but wow. As they looked at the screen to her profile picture they thought collectively, 'Plus, she looks damn good for her age.'"Ms. Camilla is an Elder Devil, the most powerful of the succubus species gifted with immense magical power, superhuman strength, reflexes, regeneration, and senses. They have the longest natural lifespan of any other succubus being 300 years. Unlike Lesser and Greater devil classes, they have little desire in pulling pranks and all manner of mischief, instead focusing more of their time on developing new spells or gaining knowledge. However, being creatures of discord, they occasional test their spells on unsuspecting victims; both for research and for amusement.", Sterling finished changing the slides"Ms. Sartana was born in what is now Tampico, Mexico to Jimena Sartana and an incubus father by the name Asta Rothè. Her mother absconded with her at a young age to escape her abusive spouse and resentment among his harem. Unfortunately, it was during the time of the Mexican-American war and the ongoing conflict made finding refuge and supplies rather cumbersome. They were both on the verge of starvation and turned to stealing food from army caravans and storage houses. Her mother taught her several charm, enchantment spells and hand-to-hand combat. They avoided large settlements and never stayed in any single location for too long for fear of their true identities being discovered. For three decades they traveled witnessing many conflicts and atrocities among the U.S., Indigenous tribes, and Mexicans. After Camilla reached age 40—post adolescence for most Succubi—her mother mysteriously disappeared leaving Camilla alone to defend herself.Ein covered her mouth in shock as her sisters wore similar expressions. Sterling had to pause for a second before continuing."For the decades that followed, Ms. Camilla wandered throughout her home country surviving on her own, witnessing other political conflicts of her country, and developing her own spells. All the while, watching the world and humanity develop around her. ""8 years prior, when the Interspecies Exchange was still in its earliest stages of development, countries like Mexico were still adjusting to the news of quote ''monsters' living among them. Self-proclaimed 'monster hunters' took to the streets on bloody crusades. Ms. Camilla was discovered by ragtag group of radicals and pursued near the border. Luckily, she was saved by another succubus who then invited her to join her husband's harem. She reluctantly accepted given the less desirable alternative. For privacy sake, she wouldn't disclose much info on her time there. However, she admits that it was her husband that sold her to the Mexican cartel. There she was drugged and had one of many collars imbued by an angel's magic sealing ability. How they acquired these is still unknown. She'd spent a year forced into liminal prostitution. Camilla was one of succubi victims that was taken in after the motel incident in Cullman."As the slide show came to an end, Sterling took his seat."Wow, they're quite an interesting bunch.", Zwei stated breaking the tense atmosphere, "You sure this guy really needs our protection?"Ein was about to reprimand her sister before Sterling interjected, "A fair question. Yes, no matter how powerful his wards may be, they are still designated as students. As such, they are restricted to abiding by ICEP laws against use of unlawful force. I don't know how things are done in your branch in Thailand but here only MON personnel have jurisdiction to apprehended individuals be it human or Extraspecies"Zwei crossed her arms in front of her relentingly, "Alright I see your point."Sterling placed his suitcase on the table and pulled out a large manilla packet. He slid it in front of Ein who immediately grabbed it. Her sisters slid closer to get a better look. She opened it up to find several documents and three MON I.D. cards."Enclosed inside are you MON I.D.s for the state of Alabama, a lease form, workman's visas, and citizenship records. You will also find additional information concerning your assignment.", Sterling said as he rose from his seat and packed up his laptop and turned off the monitor. He then walked to the door and stopped to turn around to the trio who trained their eyes on him."Lastly, I'd like to say this Exchange branch is thankful for your service at this time.", Sterling stated with a professional demeanor. The trio stood up straight simultaneously and bowed respectfully."We are the ones who are grateful for being selected for this task.", Ein stated formally."We will carry out our mission with diligence, patience, and determination.", Drei added"And we aren't just here to get a free vacation.", Zwei added before her sisters tackled her using their hands to cover her mouth while she flailed about to get free."Ahahaha, j-just ignore that sir, our sister loves to joke around", Ein nervously chuckled.Sterling raised an eyebrow suspiciously before his phone vibrated alerting him of a caller, "Ah, it looks like I'm being called in by I.A. chairman. We'll depart in 2 hours to your assignment location feel free to get a tour of our facility from Patricia.", he said before closing the door leaving them in the room alone.Ein and Drei released their sister breathing a sigh of relief before shooting angry glares at their sister. Zwei waved them off and took out a document from the packet with Caleb's information, including his work address and smirked deviously....Meanwhile...Interspecies Affairs a complex made up of 6 large facilities for education, job training, physical and mental health care, research and development of technology, manufacture of goods from liminal resources, and housing and covering 30 square miles.The housing area was a huge apartment complex with room units, a lounge area, club and study rooms, food service, and other amenities all catering to any liminal's individual need.In the lounge area, there were several liminals chatting among each other, enjoying lunch from the food court, or simply relaxing. Sitting at a large table for six was a familiar. It has Hana, the blue devil girl going over her notes she had taken in class. She had taken up training to become a nursing aid, seeing as how her affinity for charm spells makes it easy to alleviate a patient's tension."Hana. Hey Hana!", called a voice from across the room. Hana snapped to attention before turning around and smiling at the sight of Sharon, Sylvia, and Hiedi walking towards her carrying trays of food. They each took a seat around the table placing their trays down."Hi guys, how've you all been?", Hana stated lightly placing her binder to the side."Hiedi and I have just been getting used to being roomies. Turns out this one's a bit of a neat freak. She even color coordinates her panties.", Sylvia grinned playfully pointing down at Heidi's legs."Eeeeee SYLVIA, vhy would you tell them that?! Und stop going through mein kleider!", Heidi shrieked blushing bright red and swatting her hands erratically at the chuckling Slyvia. Hana and Sharon giggled happily at their shinanigans."What about you Sharon?", Hana inquired curiously."I got a job at the salon close by here and I decided to get what the humans call a 'G.E.D.'", Sharon stated."Oh, you're going the formal education route too.", Hana said with a smile."Yeah, but it's kinda hard. Why do humans do so much math? What use is Pythagorean thereom? Why would want to know how long each side of a triangle is?! It's a damn TRIANGLE!", Sharon ranted with an annoyed pout before sucking down her berry-blast milkshake. Hana shyly smiled at her as Sylvia and Hiedi snickered at her frustration. Suddenly a thought crossed Sylvia's mind."Hey, you guys heard about Scarlett?", Sylvia stated and was met with curious yet worried looks."N-no, I honestly haven't spoken to her in a couple weeks.", Hana admitted somberly"I spoke to her last week and tried to get her to have lunch with us, but she turned me down.", Sharon said looking a little down."She's been going to therapy you know? I heard she refuses to be evaluated by any human male staff though. When she isn't there, she's mostly in her room.", Sylvia added. They all sat in silence for a full minute before Hana spoke up breaking the silence."Y-you know guys...we should do something for her. Get her out for a while you know?", Hana said as the girls perked up one by one."Yeah! I heard from this Mothman girl at work about this cafe with open mike nights. We can go there.", Sylvia stated enthusiastically. Hana smiles as her wings twitch happily."That's a great idea, Sylvia.", Hana said as Sharon and Heidi voiced their approval as well. Sharon then took a celebratory bite out of her double cheeseburger. As she enjoyed the taste, a thought suddenly crossed her mind."Huh, this burger reminds me of the ones that human gave us at the motel.", Sharon remarked fondly, "Do you guys ever think about him? What was it, uhh, Caleb?"The others went silent as they let the question bounce around in their heads."W-well yeah sometimes, I think about what he may be doing after everything that happened.", Hana said as her cheeks turned a darker shade of blue."I believe he's doing ok. Although, he'd probably be more interested in how we're doing.", Sylvia stated."Hehe so wahr (so true). He vas so kind to us, he protected us and even prevented Camilla from being deported. I never knew human men could be so selfless.", Heidi commented as the others smiled agreement."He's pretty cute too right?", Sharon asked with a literal devilish grin. The other girls were slightly caught and flushed in embarrassment. Sylvia was the first to break the ice."Yeah, he's not half bad looking. I'd go on 1 or 4 dates with him. What about you Heidi? Hana?", Sylvia asked to which to girls blushed even deeper shades of red, or blackish-blue in Hana's case."I-I...I, vell... I vouldn't exactly...say 'no'...but...", Heidi muttered burying her head using her wings as curtains."He is really nice, so...", Hana bashfully played with the tips of her claws."Awwww, I'm soooo jealous of Camilla. Living with a stud like that and not having to memorize a bunch of useless equations?", Sharon groaned miserably, "I can imagine the fun they have together."Sharon and the others paused each imagining the kind of fun that Camilla and Caleb have together before imagining their own scenarios. Pretty soon the table was filled with slightly maniacal girlish giggling attracting curious and disturbed stares from other Extraspecies in the area.Hana placed her palms on the and rose up with a determined expression, "You know what guys? We should ask if we could visit them!""Y-yeah, I'm sure the I.A. board will let us have a day pass. Totally!", Sharon chimed. Heidi and Sylvia nodded enthusiastically in agreement."Maybe we could get Scarlett to come too!", Hana stated and the others voiced their approval individually. It was unanimous.While this was going on, Scarlett herself had just gotten to her single bedroom apartment unit. She had another therapy session earlier followed by a workout routine suggested by her shrink to help relieve stress. She carried a few bags with her, gym cloths, groceries, a white takeout bag with I.A.'s food service logo on it. She unlocked the door with her designated card key and stepped inside before closing the door locking it. A few minutes later, she finished putting away her stuff. She decided to rest on the couch with the TV off before placing the white bag on the floor. She emitted an exasperated sigh as she removed her shoes to get more comfortable before lying on her stomach. The last few weeks had taken a toll on her nerves. Not just the rigorous therapy session where she's forced to relive the horrible experiences she's endured but the anxiety and frustration she felt towards herself for being too weak to do anything to stop it. Honestly, she hated those sessions; just talking about her humiliation as some human sits there pretending to understand how she feels. She started going to the Extraspecies fitness center to alleviate stress but that soon stopped having any real affect. Even going out in public filled her with fits of paranoia. She felt as if hundreds judgmental and scornful eyes filled her with insecurity and shame at how weak she was. She's sick of it!"...dammit. Damn it all.", Scarlett cursed to herself as she dug her claws into the couch cushions. Suddenly her stomach growled alerting to the fact that she hadn't eaten at all today.She sighed as she adjusted herself to sit upright before grabbing the white bag. Opening it up, she took out a small salad, some fried potato wedges, and a veggie burger. She drew a magic seal in the air and the fridge opened allowing for a bottle of water to come floating to her awaiting palm. She ate some of the wedges first before opening the wrapper to the veggie burger. Before taking a bite, she stared at it pensively and the memory of Caleb flashed in her mind. She remembered the look of genuine care and concern he gave her; someone he didn't even know. In that moment, she felt...safe? Feeling her face begin to heat up the more she thought about him, she quickly drained two-thirds of the water bottle then turned to finish the rest of her meal in relative peace....Elsewhere...The twister triplets were atop a building surveying the area where Caleb worked. Zwei and Drei were sitting on the roof's edge with binoculars watching the various people in the office searching for their target. Ignoring their sister Ein nervously pacing back and forth behind them mentally and verbally voicing her disapproval over the situation."Weshouldn'tbehere. Weshouldn'tbehere. Weshouldbehere!", Ein panicked nervously biting her nails.Zwei turned her head behind to face her sister, "Ein, will you just chill out?!""How can I 'chill out'?! Couldn't we have at least TOLD them we were going out?!", Ein ranted to her sister."Even if we did, they'd have somebody else tag along to babysit us. Don't you guys at least want to see what this guy's like for yourselves? Don't you want this new assignment to be worth it?", Zwei replied enticingly."We JUST started working for this branch and regardless of what he's like, we're still expected to follow orders. Besides, this is the least challenging assignment we've had in a VERY long time and I don't want to lose!", Ein finished in a serious tone remembering the grueling missions and mountains of paperwork they had back in China."I know sis, but it's totally fine. We have another three and a half hours until departure, there's plenty of time to get back. They'll never know we were gone.", Zwei beamed a confident smile.Ein sighed into the palms of her hands unconvinced by her optimism, "…I tried to stop you guys. I really did."Drei turned around with a dry look, "If you call repeatedly saying 'Come back here you guys' as you followed us, then yes, you sure did. 'A+' for effort, but my grading system is extremely lenient."Ein pouted angrily at her sister's comment as Drei resumed her position."Oh, we have a visual!", Zwei commented excitedly pointing downwards. Ein and Drei looked down to see Caleb exiting the building with a group of other people. Zwei stood up from her position."Let me see!", Ein said as she took the binoculars from Zwei. She could see him silently walking with five other humans.Zwei smirked at her sister's sudden interest, "Hah, looks like somebody's getting curious.""I think she's just surrendering to the Stockholm.", Drei commented."I wonder where he's going.", Ein said ignoring her sisters."Only one way to find out!", Zwei stated whipping up a small gust of wind, "Let's get a closer look.", she finished leaping off the building and bouncing off the pockets of air following in the group's direction with great speed (think of Sanji from One Piece's 'Sky Walk' but more ninja-like). Ein's expression became more distressed."Zwei wait, come back here!", Ein called out but was ignored. She turned to Drei only to find her bouncing leisurely and repeated 5 feet from the from building."I really admire you level of commitment. Keep it up and you may make the Dean's list.", Drei commented before leaping off after her sister. Ein stammered trying to think of a retort but hung her head in defeat. She then whipped up her own wind and proceeded after her siblings."Why do I always have to be the responsible one?", Ein whined as she leapt through air like lightning after them.…minutes later….The girls were now hiding behind the tall hedges of a small dental office next to Chick-fil-a. They had a small space cleared out to see Caleb's every movement. Zwei used her special technique where she sends tiny, unnoticeable gusts of wind at her target which rebound carrying the sound of their words back to her. She calls it her 'Voice of the Wind' and they're using it to eavesdrop on the groups conversation."He seems a bit more…reserved than I thought. He's only spoken when spoken to since he sat down. And the other humans won't shut up about football and vampires!", Ein said."Then again it kinda makes sense, considering what he went through. It's not every day a nerd contends with violent gang members AND save like 9 demon girls in one night.", Zwei remarked adjusting the binocular vision."That beats the hell outta my fanfiction.", Drei commented."He seems like a pretty nice guy though. I saw him pay for that blonde human woman's food for her." Ein added with a small smile, "He seems like a gentleman.""An anime fan too! Didn't you hear him list some of the newest shows out this year to that guy Raj? He even likes Devilman Crybaby!", Zwei stated happily, "Finally someone who appreciates true art.""I am also creating preconceived notions of him. Mine involve less family friendly content.", Drei comments with a faint ominous smirk."Looks like he's going back inside the restaurant for something", Ein as the other two refocused watch him carefully. They watched as he returned and Zwei noticed a scruffy-looking guy walking in the same direction as him seemingly about to pass Caleb. Suddenly, the man changed his direction and ran directly into Caleb spilling the latter's drink all over his clothes. The girls collectively wore serious expressions in preparation for an altercation. They watched as the man berated Caleb each glaring at him with different levels of intensity. Luckily, Caleb managed to dispel the conflict only for the man to bump past him a huff.Zwei suddenly rose from her position watching as the man pinched Caleb's wallet, "Hey you guys saw that right?", she said turning to her sisters. Ein and Drei nodded in understanding before Ein extended her long scythe out her arm."Be quick, Zwei and don't let them see you.", Ein said as Zwei got into a lunging position."They never do.", Zwei stated before Ein swung her scythe creating a mini whirlwind to whipped through the outside of the restaurant. A blade of wind knocked the man down. Zwei rode on the current faster than the eye could track snatching the wallet from the man before he hit the ground. She tossed the wallet back to Caleb's feet as he shielded his eyes from the wind. Zwei then returned to her sisters as the winds died down leaving the man's clothes riddled in holes."Ha, he never saw that coming.", Zwei chuckled before noticing the dry expressions of her sisters, "What?""Really, you had to turn the guy into Swiss cheese?", Ein inquired in a displeased tone."He had it coming.", Zwei waved off, "Plus, if steals anything else, police will know exactly where to search.""We've gotten do something about this habit of yours.", Ein sighed."I hate to call off Zwei's much needed counseling session but according to the conveniently placed clock inside the building behind us, it's about 45 minutes until we are to depart with agent Sterling.", Drei stated melancholically. Ein and Zwei took a minute to process what their younger sister before their blood pressures skyrocketed."WHAAAAAAAA?!", Ein and Zwei both shrieked.…Meanwhile….In Rodney Brown's Maximum-Security prison located in Birmingham prisoner was dressed in an orange jumpsuit and sitting in a special cell for death row inmates. It was Wick lying down on the bed staring at the ceiling in deep thought. For the last few weeks, he's endured the slander and vilification of the media, the invasive interrogations of the pigs in uniform, and finally the dog-and-pony show that was his 'trial'. And now he's on death row with his execution just 48 hours away; however, this was a part of his plan. He still had his trump card. Now that everyone believes he's as good as dead, he can now make his move.Wick adjusted his legs and stood up from the bed clenching and unclenching his hand, "Fantina.", he stated pointing at the wall in front of him. The same glowing crack appeared in front of him much to his delight, but it was short-lived. The crack began destabilizing before completely breaking down and disappearing. A dumbfounded look spread across his face."Fantina!", he called out again and the crack reappeared, this time he heard her distorted, incomprehensible voice on the other side before it once again broke down and disappeared. What the hell was going on?"FANTI—!", Wick attempted to yell out but was interrupted by an unfamiliar voice."You can try a thousand more times and you'll get the same result."Wick turned to the front of his cell and saw a man dressed in navy blue suit jacket with badge from Alabama Bureau of Investigation. He was tall with blonde hair, and one of his elongated ears had deep burn scars."What did you say?", Wick said glaring at the man, "Who are you?!""I'm Detective Greenly, I'm just a survivor of your little car bomb that claimed Gibb's life and nearly paralyzed my partner.", Greenly pulled down his shirt collar revealing the deep scar around his clavicle.Wick smirked maliciously, "Heh, looks like my work is getting sloppy in my old age."Greenly grimaced at his remark with steel cold blue eyes, "And the answer to your little question, I meant that I revoked your little get-out-of-jail-free card."Greenly snapped his fingers and Wick was stunned to see the walls and floors of his cell rippling with green-glowing energy. Every step he took, the energy spread out like a rock thrown in still water."W-What is—?", Wick was once again interrupted before he could finish."I wasn't certain at first, but I knew something was off ever since you were brought in. You were too composed, even for a sociopath like you. Then during your interrogation, for a moment, I sensed a tremendous amount of magical power radiating off you. I thought I was imagining things until I decided to do a bit more digging. I reviewed the video feed from the salvaged security cameras we uncovered at the warehouse. I saw the portal that appeared during your last attempt to allude capture. I was able to piece together that you either must have summoned it yourself or you have ties to someone who can whenever you're in a pinch. The former seemed very unlikely though.", Greenly stated with a cold tone."So…what now? Are you going to request for my execution to be moved up?", Wick stated expectantly."No. To put it plainly, I've been sent to make you sit here and await your punishment, like a good boy. Even now, it's taking a considerable amount of my own energy to keep this barrier up and disperse their magic. It's an intense strain on me, but it'll be worth it to see you answer for your crimes. However, I must commend you for finding such a powerful ally because of that we have even more reason to ensure your organization is brought down.", Greenly stated.Wick sneered and let out a light chuckle before saying, "It's funny, you people have no idea what you've awakened.""Oh? And what would that be?", Greenly asked."A rage. A rage that violates, consumes, and annihilates everything in its path. That is my family. Upon my death, all of you will suffer; ICEP, police, MON, and especially that Caleb Bizzell.", Wick spoke with venomous words."Is that all?", Greenly stated much to Wicks surprise. Greenly then turned his back to him, "If so, I think we'll be fine; because rage has a limit, but our resolve is boundless."Greenly walked away as Wick laughed scornfully at him. He then pulled out a phone and dialed a number, "Hello, Interspecies Affairs deputy chairman, I have something you're going to want to hear."Okay so, I know what you're thinking and yes. I do not upload quick enough. I know you're wondering why I didn't continue where I left off on the previous chapter? Well, three things:1. I wanted to show off the Kamataichi girls' personalities since I won't have much time to do so in the next chapter. It's gonna be more focused and Caleb and his homestays.2. I wanted to show that the other devil girls are doing ok and it's VERY they will make a return. …Perhaps in a more…'steamy' chapter later one ^^.3. Exposition. Exposition. Exposition!Well, that's about it; next chapter will be out soon, be on the look out for a new story project created by myself and ma boi Superairaptor, and remember to fav, follow, and review.This is GoatMan, say it with me y'all, PEACE FAM!
  
    Chapter Text
    Chapter 13: Complicated FeelingsAfter the... superfluously dramatic introduction of his supposed 'bodygaurds' Caleb was now in the kitchen fixing some snacks and drinks to discuss this properly. Camilla could be seen working her literal magic as all the papers and various items flew back into their original locations. The couch had been adjusted and section so that Sterling and the Zyklon siblings were seated across from Lyca and Mirabelle with the coffee table between them. Mirabelle twiddled her fingers glancing every so often at the Zyklon sisters. Lyca curiously watching the triplets before locking eyes with Zwei who smirked playfully before returning the gesture three-fold. Camilla had finished restoring the living room to it's former glory-actually it was much cleaner now- before dispelling the magic seal and join the others. She took a seat next to Mirabelle who nervously shuffled and scooted and couple inches away from her. Camilla ignored the action thinking she was probably just being polite and giving her more space.Caleb walked into the living room placing a serving tray of a plate of microwavable pigs-in-a-blanket and a piture of kiwi-strawberry koolaid with four glasses already full. He stepped away and Ein, Zwei, and Drei grabbed a glass of the sweet liquid. Ein, Zwei, and certainly Lyca proceeded to devour some of the delicious meaty morsals."Alright, now that we're all together, mind explaining the situation here Sterling? Slowly and without recreating the twister from Wizard of Oz in my living room?", Caleb inquired petulantly crossing his arms and leaning against the arm of the couch. Ein drank some of the koolaid blissfully humming at the fruity, sweet taste. Her sisters each grabbed themselves a glass too.Sterling removed his black shades meeting Caleb's gaze, " Well to put it plainly, you've officially become a target by one of the most ruthless criminal organizations in the Central United States and there's a possibility they'll try to assassinate you. What's more, they have gained the assistance of powerful liminals that we're still unsure of the exact number or even species. In order to ensure your safety, we've enlisted the help from these highly skilled MON operatives.""And that's us!", Zwei exclaimed shooting from her seat with her chest puffed out and her fist over it. Zwei turned to her sisters urging them to follow. They rolled their eyes and reluctantly raised their fist to their chests.Caleb exchanged uncertain glances with Mirabelle, Lyca, and Camilla as they processed the gravity of situation."Um that great and all but... I'm not sure if-", Caleb spoke but was immediately interrupted by Sterling."I know what you're about to say but rest assured Mr. Bizzell, these three are more than capable of handling the job. They are the some of thr top ranked MON Agents in Beijing, experts in espionage and strategic combat, and have contributed largely to suppressing liminal and human terrorists. They've already been issued passports for their indefinite stay here in the U.S. and have been registered as official temp service members of my branch.", Sterling finished.Camilla stood from her place with everyone's eyes now focusing on her, "Perdomeme, but I believe ju overlooked a couple details.""Oh, and what would those be Ms. Sartana.", Sterling replied"Ju mentioned the number of species that are assisting their organization is unknown; so wouldn't that mean they have a tactical advantage in terms of unpredictability? El patròn( criminal boss) Jakob, for example. When I encountered him a second time at la motel, I could sense a powerful magic aura radiating off him. For some time, I thought it was merely the stress of the situation affecting my senses. However, after whnat ju said, there is a chance they have a creature with great magical power working for them. I could tell by its aura it is not one of my kind. And it seems they can bestow a little of that power to humans.", Camilla finished as Caleb, Lyca, and Mirabelle shot her disbelieving and surprised looks. The Zyklon siblings listened but didn't seem too phased by the information Camilla presented and Sterling nodded understandingly also not phased."It's funny you should mention that.", Camilla raised a curious about eyebrow as Sterling leaned back against the couch cushion opening his mini briefcase and retrieving a green folder, "We actually had our suspicions about liminals with supernatural abilities being involved with the Malone family. These suspicions were only confirmed some hours ago by a reliable source."Sterling folds the outer layer of the folder behind itself exposing the paper then turning them around for Caleb's group to see, "Thing is, we've realized in these past weeks that the Malones rely very heavily on aggressiveness and unpredictability as you mentioned Ms. Sartana. However, it's those traits that we'll use collapse their system. Their trade routes appeared sporadic; frequently changing entry points into Alabama. The only reason we could shut it down so quickly was likely because they were still in the process of establishing sustainable network; they needed more time to fully understand Alabama infrustructural layout.""So you're saying it was pure luck the authorities were able to close their channels BEFORE they could be permanently integrated into Alabama.", Caleb interjected not enjoy the thought of it."Well, not 'pure', we had general information on their activity for a while already but needed a focal point to start our full investigation. Luckily, a good Samaritan went and gave us the kickstarter we needed.", Sterling flashed a knowing wink at Caleb who turned away dismissively, "Our tactics have taken a much more aggressive approach and our constituents further North have begun uncovering more trade in their states. Their activity may be unpredictable but that only shows the weakness in their unit. With the information we currently have, the pressure on them will only intensify forcing them into more conventional methods making it easier to predict their moves. Because whether they admit it or not they ARE outnumbered.", Sterling finished with a confident grin. Camilla felt a bit satisfied by his answer but couldn't shake the uneasy dread hanging in the back of her mind. Mirabelle who could only listen to them talk look over at Caleb. She could tell he was still uncertain and afraid but rightfully so.Camilla was still uncertain, but felt his answer was acceptable. Perhaps it's just what she's taught herself to believe over the years, but she couldn't shake the idea that things were going to get worse. But, at the end of the day, all that really matter was that everyone she truly cared for were safe.Sterling refocused on Camilla, "Now what was your other concern Ms. Sartana?"Camilla snapped from her thoughts and turned to Sterling and the Kamataichi, "Jes, dis house only has four rooms and dèr all occupadò. Where are they going to stay?", She finished as Caleb , Lyca, and Mirabelle let the realization sink in. For Mirabelle and Lyca, they were both busy thinking of the pros and cons of possibly sharing a room with a complete stranger. Caleb dreaded the realization he may get more renovation done on his house. They JUST did renovations a few days ago to modify the guest bedroom for Camilla; and they ripped out the ENTIRE section of his house to do it-while he and the girls were still inside! He swore if anymore of these government folks come tearing up his crib one more time, he was gonna lose it."Ah, well that's no problem. We already have a solution to that.", Sterling said putting away everything in his briefcase. He stood up and walked to the front door with the Zyklon sisters soon following behind (after each of them poured a second glass of koolaid). Caleb and the girls watched in bewilderment as they walked past before Sterling stopped at the door, turned to them and said, "Come outside please."Sterling and the Kamaitachi left outside the house. Caleb turned to his homestays and shrugged before leading the way. The evening sun hung in the sky bathing the world around them in a vibrant auburn light. Caleb noticed Sterling and the Kamaitachi standing on the walkway gesturing for them to follow. He and the girls were surprised to see a house right next to his that was not there before separated by a 4 foot brown picket fence. Upon crossing into the next yard, they got a better look and were greeted by the Kamaitachi standing on the the lawn pointing in a 'Ta-DAA!' fashion. The house was a third the size of Caleb's with a similar architectural design. Aside from a different colored roof, it was essentially a miniature version of the house next to it. The girls gazed in awe at the miniature version of their house as Caleb jaw hung open limply as his brain was devoting it's energy to answering how this could even happen."What do you think, not too bad huh?", Sterling smugly proclaimed."U-U-Uh, Sterling, how the h-", Caleb barely got out before Sterling was next to him pushing his back to hurry on inside. Caleb turned his head to see each of the Kamaitachi hurrying one of the girls into the house. He could also make out the image of some ICEP vans pulling into his driveway and men in grey jumpsuits getting out."Hey, wait Sterling what's...uhhh", Caleb silenced his tirade as his eyes widened in astonishment. Whoever built this place took a page out of Snoopy's doghouse because it was much bigger inside compared to the outside. The interior was decorated in a very Central Asian theme complete with sleek, red, black, and gold furniture and wall colors, nature patterned lanterns, Zen Buddhist ornaments, and even little bamboo plants. There was an staircase leading up to three doors. The girls came in one after another with Caleb's homestays gazing in sheer amazement.Each of the Zyklon sisters had bright, flickering stars in their eyes as they admired this luxury palace that was their new home. Certainly a step up from the terribly high rent studio apartment they used to live in. They won't even have to share a bed! They regrouped huddling together collectively thinking 'Score' and fist bumping each other."Impressive, huh?", Sterling said picking up a paper lantern examining it, "Well let's get on with the tour."...After a good 20 minutes, Sterling had finished showing the group the entire layout of the house. It had all the basic amenities( Kitchen, bath, bedrooms ect.) and everything was built to be wind resistant since the Zyklon siblings frequently used their wind powers. However, it also double as a safehouse for Caleb and his homestays; reinforced walls and doors, bullet proof wind resistant glass windows, and even a large panic room built into the floor of the dining room. There were even alarm system attached to each of the Zyklon siblings bedrooms(still bare until their belongings arrive) that'd sync with Caleb's. They were only half-way set up though. Throughout the tour, tried asking questions about this house's existence but was constantly brushed off by Sterling, to his growing impatience.Caleb looked around to see his homestays and his bodyguards mingling together. Camilla and a Mirabelle listened with genuine curiosity as Ein explained the cultural significance of the Zen statues. Lyca and Zwei were playing with some giant gold and black spinning tops which Zwei made fly with tiny cyclones. Drei just sat crossed legged atop the stairs rails quietly observing everyone with the focus of an Elite chess player."And that's everything you need for now, I'm going to let you all get to know each other better. Caleb get the girls homes and Zyklon get Caleb AND the girls home. I bid you good ev-", Sterling was turning to leave when a hand placed on his shoulder interrupted him. He turned to see Caleb with a menacing aura surrounding him."Ohhh no you don't! You've been dodging me since we got here and you're going to answer my questions. How the hell could you get this house built in less than a DAY!?", Caleb unloaded at the agent and the group of liminal girls turned their attention towards the human men.Sterling faced Caleb with a slight snarkiness in his eyes, " For your information, we checked the land for soil contaminants and zoning issues yesterday, got approved by the municipal system's to buy the property yesterday, got a building permit yesterday, had this house was designed yesterday, built yesterday, transported from the contractors yesterday, and requested for the immediate installation for heating, water, and electricity...yesterday", he finished putting on a pair of black shades."How is that even HUMANLY possible?!", Caleb retorted incredulously."Geez, calm down, it's not like YOU had to accomplish this within our constraints.", Sterling shot back crossing his arms. Caleb was about to rebut curiously before he felt something tug at his right pant leg. Looking down, he was surprised to see Drei with a deadpan expression."It's easier not to think about it.", She spoke calmly warning him. Caleb opened his mouth but no words came as he realized this conversation would go nowhere. He decided to let it go."Fine, fair enough, sorry for hollering at ya.", Caleb apologized, "But, one last thing. You mentioned that their alarm system would be synced to my house? How does that work exactly?"Sterling perked up a bit forgiving the boy's rudeness, "Oh, I'm glad you asked. Your house will be equipped with it's own high grade alarm system. It should be operational right about...now."Caleb's blood vessels turned to ice as he remembered catching a glimpse of men in jumpsuits approaching his house, "Mr. Sterling...what have you done?""Why don't you come see and find out", Sterling chided walking out of the door before Caleb could get another word in.The second Caleb and all the girls followed him next door, they were greeted with the sight of workers in grey jumpsuits exiting the house in a straight line and Sterling waving them off. He then urged Caleb and the group to come in to which Caleb grumbled begrudgingly.They spent 15 minutes looking over some of the home's new 'features'. Namely, how the walls were now reinforced to withstand powerful winds. The front and back doors were now equipped with automated touchpad locks and integrated with sensor alarms throughout the house. The bedroom doors were replaced with steel-plated ones. Lastly, there was the most important feature Sterling showed them; the panic button. It looked more like a regular fire alarm inside a plexiglass box attached to the wall by a lock and key mechanism. Sterling explained that it's meant as a last resort and will activate the external defense system; putting the house on full lock down and immediately calling in authorities.When that was all done, Sterling bid good night to the Bizzell household( after some more banter with it's host of course) and gave have his bout of confidence to the Zyklon sisters to fulfill their duty. As he was leaving, he couldn't help but feel like he forgot to mention something important. After he left, Caleb realized it was about time to prepare dinner. Camilla and Mirabelle offered to help (simultaneously in fact) but he politely declined claiming it was his 'host responsibility' but really he didn't want to keep maneuvering past someone or have quasi sentient ingredients moving everywhere. Tonight's dish was supposed to be a quick on anyway; Three cheese garlic spaghetti and lamb chops. The Zyklon sisters joined them for dinner since they hadn't done any grocery shopping yet. Caleb wasn't really annoyed about making three extra servings; and they praised his boss ass cooking skills so that fed his confidence a bit.After dinner, he did the dishes alone, again telling Camilla and Mirabelle not to worry, while Lyca and Zwei played Dragonball FighterZ. From the other room, he could make out the enthusiastic chatter from the two gamers. All while Drei commentated on the two; a few times Caleb giggled at her quips. Ein and Camilla were having what sounded like an engaging conversation. The only one who was really quiet was Mirabelle which didn't surprise him that much. She hasn't even adjusted to Camilla's presence let alone 3 more girls that literally blew into their lives. He'll have to help her soon.Afterwards, the Zyklons did a quick perimeter check of the property then said their good nights and left for their house next door. Lyca turned in early feeling tired from her long workout earlier, Mirabelle was taking a bath, and Camilla was in her room.Caleb was walking down the hall to his with a can of diet Dr. Pepper in hand. All the while, thinking about how jarring it is that his house looks relatively the same but can now withstand Cat.5 hurricane. He let out an exhausted yawn stretching out his arms before opening the can and taking a swig. The sweet carbonated brown liquid burned the back of his throat sparking new life in his weary eyes and alleviating a little bit of stress."Ahhh, food, air, and diet Dr. Pepper-these are the things I need to survive life.", Caleb sighed to himself walking into his room closing the door; actually feeling the newly added weight it had. He set down his now half empty can of liquid happiness and proceeded to get comfortable. He tossed away his belt about to change into T-shirt to sleep in when he heard a knock at his door and turned to it curiously."S-Senor?", came the muffled voice of the Elder devil on the other side. Wow, partially sound proof too."Ms. Sartana?", Caleb responded before opening the door with a little extra effort (this'll take some getting used to) revealing Camilla standing in the middle of the hallway in front of his door, "What's up?"He could tell from how she securely cradled her arms under her busom, her legs kept shifting, and didn't make eye contact, that she was clearly nervous about something. Obviously, he's gotten very used to noticing body language like this."Ms. Sartana, I know there's something bothering you. I right her if you need me.", Caleb assured her and she instantly felt calm enough to meet his gaze. She inhaled then exhaled and suddenly stepped up close enough that they were inches away. Caleb, caught off guard, instinctively took a step back."Señor Caleb, I need to talk with ju about something important.", she said as her wing expanded slightly before slowly lowering back down, "M-may I come in?""YEAH sure come on in, just uhh, here take this seat.", Caleb rolled the chair from his desk computer to the front of his bed. It's a good thing he did some cleaning in his room yesterday; he didn't want to show his sloppy side just yet. Camilla proceeded to close the door but Caleb stopped her, "No no no, l-leave it half-open, please."Camilla was a little surprised but complied with his wish, "O-ok".He mentally breath a sigh of relief. It would be too distracting having someone of her...gender and...bonniness in his room with the door closed. After ignoring every scenario his brain could concoc t within a second, he sat down on the bed directly in front of her and said, "So, what do you need to talk about?"Camilla took a second to collect her thoughts, "I...I wanted to tell you that...that...I...", She stammered over her words as her mind began to began to become hazy. His expression morphed to one of genuine concern and it just made her heart melt even more. Caleb attempted to reach out in an attempt to comfort her when suddenly..."Gahhh, Por qué en los nueve círculos esto me está sucediendo?! (Why in the nine circles is this happening to me)", Camilla exclaimed burying her face in her hands.Caleb was confused but tried to remain empathetic, "Uhh, it's ok, take your time. You don't to force yourself if you're not sure you tell me yet.""DAT, right there, stop it! Dis isn't how things go.", Camilla demanded in a grim tone. She looked back at to see his reaction. Caleb expression hadn't changed; only silently allowing her time to collect herself more. Camilla exhaled, "Remembered earlier when I said ju were the only man who's ever cooked for me?""Yeah, I remember.", Caleb answered."Well, it's true. In my 180 years living in this world, I've seen and experienced the most worst things men can do.", Camilla started, "That includes mi padre (father); who was nothing short of cruel to mi madre (my mom) and I. I despise him for forcing her to do what she did. Every day we were forced to endure the harshness of our war torn country. The humans we encountered every now and again treated us like animals. They hurt us. They hurt me, so I wanted to hurt them back any way I could." Caleb listened intently seeing the pained expression on her face."Over time, I grew to almost enjoy it. Charming and manipulating vile, weak-willed human men who were little more than swine in clothing. Then one day mi Madre left me without a word; suddenly I was alone with the men I treated as my toys. I survived on mi own through the years that followed however I could; stealing, manipulating...", Camilla hesitates feeling a lump grow in her throat, "e-even killing." Caleb's eyes widened in shock at her last statement."Mi ex-husband was even worse. He used me then sold me away. The human men in the cartel...used and did many horrible things to me.", Camilla somberly rubbed her hand across her shoulders and sides, " Suddenly I was now the toy for the same vile swine I grew up with. What's worse, I was forced to watch others of mi pende( my race) suffer the same fate. All this time, I hated men and was convinced there was no such thing as kind one.", Camilla looked up at Caleb with puppy eyes, "And then I met ju, Señor. Ju saved me and helped me more than I ever thought possible; more than I thought any person could.", Camilla rose up and walked closer to Caleb, "A-And...that's why...I believe you're the one. Señor."Caleb was taken aback by her statement, "The one...what?""We Succubi have a bit of a myth among our race. The myth that for every succubus born into this world, an individual that is meant to be their partner is born as well. These two are then meant to find each other will become lover. We call these individuals our 'Destined Ones'", Camilla explained, "Of course, it is only a story we are told as younglings. But there are members of my people that spend most of their lives searching for their Destined One. It's...actually why they steal life energy to add more years to their life span-just to keep searching longer. Most give up their search and end up filling the void in their heart by settling for a life in an incubis harem or using human men.", Camilla explained gazing down at Caleb much to the latter's slight discomfort.Caleb scooted to the side and stood up meeting her at eye level, despite the 4 inch height difference. "Ms. Sartana...""Please, Señor, call me Camilla", She corrected with a sweet grin."Ok, Camilla, you don't actually believe that I am your...destined lover or whatever right? It's preposterous.", Caleb stated to Camilla's bewilderment."But I've heard that humans believe in something similar; that there is someone out there meant to be jour partner?", Camilla inquired."That's just something we tell ourselves to make us feel a little less lonely. We also say 'there's plenty of fish in the sea' but the sea is too vast and most of us have never been fishing.", Caleb stated flatly.Camilla tilted her heard curiously, "I'm not sure I follow Señor. What are ju saying?""I'm saying there's no such thing as destiny. Nobody is MEANT for anybody.", Caleb stated."Jes, I thought the same too Señor.", Camilla replied, "But...it feels as though something deep inside me has been awakened; something I never knew was there. Whenever I'm near ju, I get so easily flustered and self-concious. Mi thoughts race and I feel nervous yet...blissful. I don't despise it, I can't help but enjoy every minute of it. No man has ever done anything like this to me before and I need to explore it.", Camilla said.Caleb sighed not out of exasperation but understanding, "Camilla, listen, it's just a crush, nothing more. You're just confusing gratitude for infatuation, it happens to everyone. Emotions are complicated sometimes.""I am not confused Señor! I know what I am feeling and ever I met you that night in the warehouse my heart refused to stop pounding. Even now it won't stop!", Camilla stepped up closing the distance between them and grabbed his hand pressing it firmly against her left breast. Caleb face heated up and his heart and mind raced trying to process what was happening, "Can ju feel it? How our hearts beat as one?", She inquired pressing his hand into her more causing soft flesh to spill between his fingers.'I'm feeling somethin' alright!', Caleb mentally screamed wanting but also NOT wanting her to let go. He tried to pulls is arms back but her grip was like hydrolic press. Thing was, he COULD actually feel her heart thumping. His legs fidgeted trying to hide the growing tension in between. He froze up when her face began creeping closer to his with slightly parted lips. Caleb felt his back hit against his book shelf knocking down a few literary volumes."Señor Caleb, I think I love ju!", Camilla confessed with a heavy blush in her cheeks as Caleb's jaw hung in shock. The shock of hearing this caused his sense of reason return momentarily. She inched ever closer with half lidded eyes."C-Camilla, please lis-!", he sentence was interrupted by a faint squealing sound like someone holding in a sob. Both he and Camilla turned and were shocked to see Mirabelle standing in front of the door now all the way open. A feeling of deep regret instantly shot through Caleb's nerves.Her entire body was trembling, her eyes welled with tears, her chest palpitated erratically trying to contain her sobs as her hands covered her quivering bottom lip. She couldn't look away at the scene before her. The man she loved in the arms of another woman. One so much better than her. It hurt, so much."I knew it.", Mirabelle whimpered in bitter defeat as tears streamed down her cheeks. Camilla loosened her grip and Caleb immediately pulled away from her."Moon Pie, I know how this looks but you gotta listen...Moon Pie!", Caleb managed to get out before Mirabelle turned and ran back to her room sobbing. Caleb went after her leaving Camilla standing alone in his room.Mirabelle rounded into the entrance of her and proceeded to shut the door tight when it stopped...right onto Caleb's fingers."OW, Fuckin' Fuck sprinkles!", Caleb exclaimed as he cursed himself not thinking that through; plus the damn door is practically made of metal now. Mirabelle threw the door open surprisingly easily (does she even lift) with a horrified expression as she saw Caleb cradling his injured fingers."Caleb! Are you okay?! I'm so sorry! I-I didn't mean...*sniff*...I", Mirabelle anguished at the feeling of causing her dear even more pain. Why can't she do anything right?Suddenly, Caleb gently cupped the side of her face with his other hand silencing her as they locked eyes, "Moon pie, it's okay, it was only an accident and I'm not mad. You would never intentionally hurt me.""Señor, are ju okay?! Do ju need any help?", Camilla inquired worriedly then noticed the tender moment they were sharing."I just got my hand caught in the door. Don't worry my fingers are in tact", Caleb emphasized opening and closing his fist in front of both of them to show he was fine, "I'm sorry but can we finish our...discussion in the morning?", He finished in a serious tone.Camilla wore a slightly disappointed expression shifting her gaze between him and Mirabelle-lingering a bit on Mirabelle. "S-Si Señor, it can wait", Camilla uttered before heading off to her bedroom closing the door audibly alerting the two that they were alone."Can I come in?", Caleb requested surprising Mirabelle for a moment who looked away dejectedly before wordlessly stepping backwards allowing him to walk in. She closed the door walking over to her bed near the window as Caleb looked around her spacious room. His gaze lingered on a China cabinet filled with rows of Sailor Moon figurines; a few he noticed he bought for her. He looked back at Mirabelle only now noticing her attire of a large dark purple linen robe with silver crescent moon shapes all over covering most of her upper and lower half.He stepped closer to as she refused to make eye contact. He wasn't sure how to salvage this but he will do his best, "Moon pie, listen that wasn't...""Are you sure?! Because it bloody looked as much to me!", Mirabelle cut him off surprisingly speaking in a cold tone, "She was so close to you! She wanted you...and I'm sure you wanted her too."Caleb looked at her sadly, "Mirabelle, you know that isn't true. We were having a relatively normal conversation until she started talking about all this destiny shit. I don't even like her like that.""But you were groping her! ", Mirabelle cried her voice cracking."N-No she just grabbed my arm tight and held it there herself! Even tried to pull away but she's too damn strong!", Caleb finished but he could tell by her expression she wasn't convinced.Mirabelle hung her head low, "Did you want to let go?"Caleb paused at her question hesitating for a moment as he thought about his experience moments ago."Hehe, s-see? You're expression tells it all.", She giggled sadly before shifting to a more serious tone, "Remember earlier in the dining room...when I said...I loved you? I meant that I'm IN love with you. But you're only reply was 'I know'. I eventually realized something; even in the dreamscape, you've never said 'I love you' back."Caleb eyes widened at the realization that what she said was true. He knew she cared deeply for him but he never imagined her feelings were this strong. Honestly, he always thought she was beautiful, kind, understanding, and sweet; she's an amazing. But he didn't want those to grow beyond that. He didn't deserve someone like her for what he was, not one goddamn bit. His hands are stained with blood and he refuses to allow her become tainted by him. But he STILL managed to hurt her. This was all his fault and he wasn't sure how to fix it. But...he had to try."Mirabelle...you are so important to me. You're more precious to me than you know.", Caleb spoke closing the distance between them as remained totally still. He then placed both hands on her shoulders but she didn't react or pull away and lifted her chin forcing her to look him in the eyes, "And I never want to imagine my life without you.", he embraced her in a hug and she slowly returned it.Mirabelle stared back at him longingly. He still can't say it. She can see the genuine care in his eyes and his devotion towards her. But he STILL can't say. Why? Deep down she knew the answer; the other girls. All of them had far more desirable traits. Lyca with her confident, energetic, and fearless personality. Camilla and her wisdom and years of experience with cooking, housework, and even men. Even the Zyklon siblings with their combat expertise and endearing personalities.And what about her? A needy, weak, sniveling coward. With so many better alternatives, no wonder his feelings for her are so uncertain. She knew she needed to do something. Something to prove her value to Caleb.Mirabelle looked upwards from her window at the dark night sky. The murky black clouds slowly revealing the bright lunar beauty. 'It's almost time.', she thought....In the other rooms...Lyca was lying spread out in her bed of animal skins blissfully snoring. Suddenly her body started to twitch erratically , her chest grew tight, and the spot between her legs began to heat up to uncomfortable levels.In Camilla's room, Camilla was sitting at her dresser mirror sketching something on a large pad thinking about what she said to Caleb. She couldn't believe how desperate she made herself look. At the same time, she couldn't think of how he looked with señorita Mirabelle. What is their relationship? Before she could question it further, she found herself cradling her abdomen groaning in discomfort. Her chest grew tight, her breathing became ragged, and the area between her legs began to pulsate with heat. She pulled herself up and saw, in the reflection of her mirror, the moon peaking behind the cloud. 'En no, por qué ahora?'( Oh no, why now?), She thought to herself....Back to Mirabelle...She could feel her body starting to react to the full moon's rays. But she was ready. In truth, She had spent the last few hours debating whether or she should go through with this. What if she wasn't ready? What if HE wasn't ready?! She has no experience with this stuff what if she messes up?! Or ruins the experience?! What if she does something he doesn't like?! Not to mention, it's against the exchange laws! What if they're found? What will happen to them?! What if they take her away?! SHE'LL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN!'No...no no no. I HAVE to do this! This is my one chance to earn Caleb's love. My one chance to show...that I can be brave like the rest of them. I'll...I'll face the exchange program as well if I have to' , Mirabelle thought as she stared at the now fully exposed moon. She gently pulled away taking a step back much to Caleb's immediate concern."Mirabelle, what's...", Caleb was silenced his mouth slightly agape in awe as he met her purple eyes that had a more radiant glow than usual. The mist emanating from her legs and tail began spreading out covering much of the floor. All the while her entire body became enraptured in a shimmering purple light that gave her an otherworldly appearance. Her eyes had now become devoid of all thoughts not related to desire. She had surrendered completely to the moon's sway."Caleb, my dear...", Mirabelle spoke softly looking up with a meek yet longing expression, "please...for tonight...lets experience pleasure...beyond our wildest dreams", She emphasized untying the sash on her robe. The entire thing to fell off her body revealing her pajamas consisting of a light purple silk partially transparent lingerie skirt that covered her upper half and part of her horse body. Underneath was a strapless dark purple bra that barely managed to contain her D-cups with matching hook-on lace panties for her front and back nether regions. Each of her legs had little purplish-black ribbons tied into bows. Caleb's heart skipped about three beats as he became entranced by her...surprisingly risque attire. The light from the moon cascade over her making her look even more ravishing.'wait...moon?", Caleb thought before looking at the full moon above her. His eyes widened in realization."Caleb my love", Mirabelle cooed stepping forward and wrapping her arms around his neck and taking him out of his thoughts, "please, I want you to take me. Right now please."She slowly brought her lips closer to his as Caleb gulped audibly parting his lips slightly. He leaned in and...TO BE CONTINUED( Roundabout starts playing)Writer's NotesHappy Valentine's Day my Fan Fic Fam!

    Chapter Text
    Chapter 14: Love, Lust, and LunacyNarrator: Last time, on Total Dram-Ahem I mean 'Monster Girls in Alabama'. Caleb and the girls were properly introduced to the trio that would be protecting Caleb from possible assassins by the Malone family. They even found out ICEP had spontaneously built a house in close proximity to Caleb's. They all seemed to get along well all things considered. Until, Camilla confessed to Caleb that he may be her soulmate. Mirabelle overheard them together and ran off to her room devastated. Caleb managed to catch her before she could lock herself in and the two finally had a heart to heart that led to Mirabelle realizing she needed to take drastic measures to ensure her love life with Caleb. Now the full moon is looming and it's already beginning to affect the girls. Will Caleb survive the night? Or will he suffer death by Monster Snu Snu? Or will he except his position and give them all some Vitamin D? Hehehe. Find out right now on MONSTER. GIRLS. ALABAMA.Caleb could feel his mind becoming cloudy as an unknown force urged him toward the awaiting lips of the woman before him. At the same time, he was internally debating with himself as he knew Mirabelle was not in control but under the influence of full moon. He had read articles on the internet about its effects on liminals and even the hosts that had to experience them. Needless to say, many of the stories he found left him feeling a bit unnerved. Luckily, he found out about these sleeping pills issued by ICEP as one of a few countermeasures to this problem and had since been keeping track of the full moon cycles. Up until now at least. He knew he needed to leave, but despite his protests, his body refused to obey his request only moving toward the angel before him."Mira...belle.", Caleb strained out finding his mind and body under a trance of her ethereal beauty. They were close enough to feel the heat radiating from their faces. Her body emitted a pleasantly sweet, lavenderish scent that enthralled his senses even more. The purple mist had now spread throughout the room reflecting the moon's rays into a violet shroud around them. It almost felt like they were once again in his dreamscape. The hoof imprint suddenly began to glow slightly sending pulses of warmth that quickly spread throughout his body. Caleb couldn't help but feel at ease. His eyes had dilated with a faint purple glow behind them. 'It couldn't hurt to indulge with a kiss at least. One kiss. Just one won't hurt. What's the worst that could happen?', is the last thought that ran through his mind.When their lips finally met, it felt as if a jolt surged between them causing them to tense up then relax. They held there for a solid 5 seconds before pulling apart to stare at each other. Both let the taste of the other sink in before diving in again and again. Their heart rates quickened as they cupped each other's cheeks pulling each other closer. What started as loving pecks gradually evolved into a full-on make-out session. Both of their tongues hungrily enjoying the taste of each other while exploring every inch of the other's mouth.The sound of wet sloppy smacking and Mirabelle's adorable moans filled the room. Caleb lost himself in the moment and the primal side of his brain overwhelmed his sense of reason. He pulled her close eliciting a startled squeak from her and tightly wrapped both arms around her back. Mirabelle grinned mushing her big bountiful breasts into his chest as Caleb tensed from the pleasant sensation. She nuzzled the crook of his neck and began leaving kisses on his skin. Caleb combed his hand through her soft hair purple mane and buried in his face inhaling the sweet scent. His other hand caressing her smooth, porcelain skin to the velvet-like fur where her torso met her horse body. They removed their heads staring into each other's eyes both breathing heavily before locking lips again. Mirabelle's hands drifted from Caleb's back to his rear and began messing with his tight arse cheeks. They parted to catch their breath leaving a strand of saliva between them. Without realizing it, his hand had snaked it's way up her side traveling up her curves as Mirabelle shivered at his touch. He placed his hand on her right breast giving a gentle, experimental squeeze. Mirabelle gave a low moan her expression one of pure bliss. Enjoying her reaction, Caleb began squeezing and massaging more vigorously. Mirabelle elicited louder breathy moans as his fingers toyed with her soft malleable flesh while his other hand stroked between her stomach and back. Her front and back legs fidgeted as both of her centers secreted more love fluid.Her hands released their grip on his butt and moved to his waist snaking her hands up his shirt. She sighed happily running her hands from his lower back over his defined abs before arriving at her target-the bulge in his inner thigh. She pulled at the hem and started to unbutton his pants. Caleb's eyes shot wide in realization."W-wait...Moon pie", he uttered as he released her breast and gently tried to move her hand away only for her to reposition them."Sssh no, it's ok my love. Relax, l want to take care of you.", Mirabelle whispered huskily as she stroked the bulge in his pants. Caleb shuddered under her touch and clenched his teeth to stifle his groans. He was then surprised to see her kneel down folding her legs inwards positioning in front of his crotch and proceed to unzip him.Caleb struggled to fully process what was happening. The feeling of absolute pleasure still bombarding his senses. It was only when he looked down at Mirabelle. The look of mad, desperately fixated desire in her dilated purple orbs and crude smile. It was then, memories of her began to play in his mind. The conversations they had. The places they went in town on his off days. Her sweet timid but adorable face whenever she looked at him. That girl in his mind was so different from the one before him. That thought alone triggered a something deep within his psyche. This wasn't her. This isn't his moon pie! She's not like this, is she? No, It's the full moon she doesn't know what she's doing! He can't do this to her! He needed to stop her!Using that last remaining bit of rationality, he spread his palms gave himself a few good, hard slaps across the face instantly startling Mirabelle who stopped her actions to gaze up with a combination of confusion and worry."D-dear, What are you doing?!", Mirabelle stood up as he quickly redid his pants. She then grabbed his shoulders with a maniacal expression and the purple aura intensify around her, "~If you like it rough, that's fine! I can take it! I'll show you! COME ON, give it to me!~"Caleb tried pulling back terrified by her sudden bout of masochism only realizing how strong her grip was. The aura she emitted covered his upper half and he could feel himself becoming fatigued near the point of collapse. Was she draining his strength? She pushed her bra up allowing her breasts to spill out and then began removing her underwear on her front portion with a lascivious giggle.'C-crap, I gotta do something. Otherwise...', Caleb thought as he felt his legs wobbled struggling to stay on his feet. Then, he remembered an experience they had during movie night a few weeks ago, 'Screw it, worth a shot!'He stopped pulling back and lunged forward his fingers spread out in a clawing motion and began aggressively tickling her sides. She froze in surprise before bursting into uncontrollable laughter. He kept it up until she was eventually lying her entire body flat on the side of the floor; ignoring her disjointed pleas for him to stop. When he stopped, she was lying on the floor chuckling, holding her stomach and trying to catch her breath. He ran out of the room as soon as some of his strength returned and closed the door jamming it shut with a nearby rubber doorstop."I'm sorry Moon Pie, but it's for your own good.", he spoke into the door before making a break for his room. If he could just activate the lock system on his door he could hold up in his room while he called MON to help keep the girls from hurting themselves.He turned to the door to his and flung it open only to freeze in place by the sight before him. Camilla, dressed in attire consisting of a pinkish-red see-through lace bra that barely managed to contain her mountainous breasts and matching G-string panties that snuggly hugged her thighs and accentuated her rear, stood in the center of his room. Her wings were outstretched, a light bluish-white aura emanated from her body and spread throughout the room, and her demonic red eyes were filled with an insatiable lust.She opened her arms in a welcoming manner as she walked toward him hips swaying seductively, "Por fin, mi Destino ha llegado t-( At last, my destiny has come t-)"."NOPE!", Caleb cut her off before slamming the door and using the newly installed lock system on his door to keep her in. He sighed in relief only to shriek in terror as she bounded the door leaving two big metallic lumps projecting from the door. All the while he could hear the muffled sound of her speaking indecipherable Spanish. Then banging came from Mirabelle's door followed by her muffled prattle. He turned and ran down the hall. He made it into the kitchen his heart and mind racing a mile a second before diving under the counter attempting to hide.'Shit, well that's out! Arghhh and my phone is in my room! It's times like this where I hate that I never got around to putting in a phone for the landline.', Caleb thought before massaging his temple trying to calm down and think. This is insane! He read about liminals going crazy during a full moon but never thought it'd be THIS bad. AND WHY ARE THEY SO GODDAMN HORNY!? Somehow, he needed to avoid the girls as much as possible but at the same time make sure they didn't accidentally hurt themselves. No to mention, if they catch him and he ends up...doing the monster mash, full moon or not they're getting deported and HE gets prison( how is that even remotely fair?). He read about a couple of ways to snap them out of it but he's too freaked out at the moment to remember what they are!"Aaarrghh, why couldn't I remember the goddamn fuckin pills?", Caleb quietly cursed himself in order to vent. He thought for a second and came up with a couple plans. Option 1: He could make it out the front door, lock it from outside, then wake up any nearby neighbor that could let him spend the night and call MON. But he'd be leaving the girls alone in the house where they could tear the place apart or hurt each other. Option 2: The panic button in the living room. If he could activate it, MON authorities should be there soon. But it'll lock down the whole house, so he'll be trapped inside...with the girls. He clenched his teeth not liking either outcome and took a deep breath before peaking around the side of the counter at the front door. Reluctantly, he chose the lesser of two evils.He stood up slowly and scanned the room. When the coast was clear, he hastily made for the door. It was then he heard a low but menacing growl that sent a shiver down his spine. He slowly turned around to be met with the image of a four-legged figure in the darkness. It's black fur blending perfectly in the night and the only visible features being the four large white fangs and seering amber eyes. He knew it was Lyca but it still scared the shot out of him. He sprinted for the door. In a flash, Lyca acrobatically leaped bouncing off the couch and the wall next to the door landing in front of Caleb who stopped in his tracks. She stalked him slowly with a deeper snarl, fangs bared, ears lowered and eyes that looked at him like he was a piece of meat."E-Eaaasy Lyca. Easy girl. It's me, Caleb. You know, Chief? We're friends. Y-you wouldn't hurt a friend, right?", Caleb slowly backed away trying to reason with the werewolf girl, but to no avail. All the while thinking how Lyca seemed to be not as...promiscuous as the other two. Maybe the full moon affected other species differently. She was actually being animalistic and savage. Any moment she could possibly tear him apart like a wild animal. It gave him no comfort at the possibility of being devoured TWO different ways tonight. Lyca continued to creep forward with drool escaping her gaping maw and her tail erect ready to lunge any moment."Lyca. It's ok. I'm your friend-WAH", Caleb exclaimed as he stumbles on one of the chairs legs from the counter. Lyca used the opportunity and lunged at Caleb. He screamed shielding his face with his arms as he was tackled to the ground by the vicious she-wolf.But instead of being torn to bloody shreds in a horrific and gory display of predation, Lyca roughly cuddled and ground against him affectionately. She sniffed him, let out playful canine yips, and licked him."Whoa, whoa ok, Gah stop it already! ", Caleb struggled as her corse tongue left his neck and cheeks coated in hot saliva. She ceased for a moment and sat up straddling his waist. She looked down at him tongue hanging out panting like the dog she was with a big, toothy smile. Her tail beat furiously against his legs as she began grinding her groin in his lap a blush forming in her cheeks."Wah, Hey! Lyca knock it off! ", she responded with more playful yips, "Can you even talk anymore?! Stop! ", Caleb stated grabbing her midsection to make her stop. He paused at the sensation on his fingers as they ran down her body to her hip. He could feel her trembling as she whimpered and moaned zealously. His jaw dropped in realization at the fact she was completely naked; the darkness making it hard to tell at first but now that he could see more closely by what little light came from the window. Her perfectly well-toned arms, rockhard thigh and leg muscles that squeezed against his hard into sides, and defined abs. The nipples on her perky A-cups were hardened stiff and she totally exposed womanhood was nicely shaven with a cute tuft of hair near the top of her clit."Arf! Awoooooooo!", Lyca howled to the ceiling stunning Caleb before brandishing her claws. In a swift motion, she grabbed his shirt tearing it in half eliciting panicked screams her Chief and exposing his bare chest. She smiled in satisfaction before nuzzling her head in his chest and grinding her body up and down his chest. Her hardened nipple scraping against his chest sent tingles down his spine. She pinned his arms to the floor as she began nibbling his flesh with her sharp fangs. All the while, her steadily moistening clit rubbed impatiently against his slacks.'Fuck, damn...she's is strong. I can barely move my arms erghhh. Guess she's not gonna eat me...in a LITERAL sense. But if this keeps up...', Caleb thought to find it hard to focus. He needed to pry her off somehow. Then he noticed she only held his biceps to the floor, he could still bend his joints upwards. 'This is a stupid idea, but fuck it.', he thought to muster up the strength in his arms and calculating her up and down motions. When his target was in reach, he grabbed two handfuls of Lyca tight ass and squeezed as hard as he could even digging his nails in her flesh. She through her entire upper body toward the ceiling arching her back then unleashing a sharp gasp simultaneously releasing her grip on him. Taking the initiative, he pushed her off of him and tried to stand up only to find legs had numbed; likely from her cutting his blood circulation when her thighs squeezed his waist.He pulled himself up using the couch as support while allowing his blood to get back flowing. He saw as Lyca lay on the floor like a puppy on it's back panting heavily. She then sat up with a disturbingly excited look on her grinning face followed by disjointed chuckling making Caleb cringe in fear. However, instead of lunging at him, she turned around, got on all fours, and stuck up her rear giving an eye full of her awaiting pussy and shapely rear. She looked back with a wide smile and golden eyes filled with lust moving her hips enticing him to mount her.Lyca-Scope'Caleb, her Alpha, stood over her staring down at her with intimidating but kind eyes. His muscular physique characterized by toned biceps, legs, thighs, and prominent washboard abs and pectorals. His outfit consisted of fur bearskin underwear and boots and a dear skin vest adorned with antler necklace. His entire presence radiated the confidence of a pack leader. He stood over her and said "Lyca, your Alpha wishes to mate with you and bare us the strongest pups for our pack."RealityLyca yipped joyfully with little Amber hearts in her eyes and tail wagging more excitedly wafting to pheromones from her steaming pussy."L-L-Lyca, for God sake gets a hold of yourself", Caleb cringed even harder blushing in embarrassment at the display. He felt the numbness fade away enough for him to stand on his own and made another dash for the front door. Lyca turned in surprise then lunged at him. Before he could even touch the knob, she had tackled him to the floor again wrapping her arms tightly around his waist and nuzzling him. Caleb grunted in frustration smacking the floor with his fist.Then he felt Lyca grip loosen completely and her entire body pulls off of him. Confused, Caleb started to get and face her. Did he somehow manage to get through to her? This assumption got tossed out the window as his eyes widened at the sight before him. Lyca was levitating above him; her entire body surrounded in a glowing blue aura. Her face and muscles twitched as she struggled to free her but she was totally immobilized. He scooted away into a crouched position as he watched Lyca suspending in midair."Heel, ju little dog.", Caleb's attention shifted from Lyca to Camilla who stood behind them with a calm but sadistic expression. A magic seal at the tip of her finger pointed at Lyca. She snapped her finger sending Lyca flying upwards with a canine yelp and stuck her to the ceiling on a larger blue seal that held her entire body in place. Camilla snickered with an amused grin, "Stay. Good girl."Caleb gulped as she then focused her attention on him; a wide devilish smile grow on her blushing face and her piercing demonic eyes set on him like a predator on the prowl.Camilla-Scope'Her Destined One stood before her beckoning her towards him. His attire being consisting of black and gold Charo(Mexican groom outfit) suit complete with black sombrero. His chocolate brown eyes filled with love, warm adoring smile, and masculine burly stache'(girl likes facial hair, go figure). He spoke to her with open arms, "Come mi amor, let us join together forever as a single entity of chaos."Reality"Oh, jes! Jes, Jes, I would love nothing more Senor!", Camilla cheerfully exclaimed with the widest smile clasping her hands as her eyes filled with bright red hearts."What the hell are you talking about?!", Caleb stated confused before turning around to the door reaching for the knob again. Only for his hand to freeze in place inches away from the knob as the same blue aura surrounded his body. His body felt as if it was being solidified in concrete until all his movements had been completely haulted. He began to levitate off the floor, away from the door, until he was hovering above the couch. Camilla snapped her fingers and the blue aura around his body vanished instantly and he fell with a shout landing on back onto the cushions. Feeling his motor skills return, he tried to get up and make another dash only for Camilla to straddle him and tear off the remainder of his shirt of leaving him topless. She stared down at him, wings folded in and tail swaying like a cat ready to pounce, with a playfully satisfied and mischevious smile that showed off her sharpened teeth. She proceeded to drag her claws against his flesh starting from his shoulders, eliciting pained grunts when she broke the skin, down to his lower stomach. Caleb shuddered as she dragged her forked tongue up against his bare chest getting a taste of her lover while her G-cup mounds glided along with her. She stopped at his chin, her tongue hanging out as her heart-shape red irises met his trembling brown, then rising up leaving a strand of saliva on his chin. She then started vigorously undulating her body grinding her womanhood and plump rear into his loins as her breast bounced with her rhythmic motion.C-Camilla, hnngh, stop! You don't...know what your doing!", Caleb strained out fighting a losing battle against his libido.Camilla stopped her movements as a physics defying devilish grin spread across her face followed by flirtatious giggles, "~hehehehehe, do not worry Señor. We Succubi are renown for our skill as passionate. Hoohoo, I in particular have decades worth of experience.~"She emphasizes her point by unhooking her bra freeing her humongous fleshy miracles of nature from the confines of the bright red linen which she carelessly tossed away. Caleb's jaw dropped as her girls plopped out in all their glory. They were like milk chocolate brown peaks with little pink dollops of creme on top that jiggled with every subtle move she made."C-c-c-camilla-uh, u-u-u-uhh,", Caleb uttered unintelligible English as his brain cells were all screaming in panic trying to process the situation; none of them successful in that endeavor. His senses went even more berserk as her tail snaked over his waist and inside his pants wriggling against is rockhard member making him squirm in protest from the intrusive extremity.Camilla snickered in devilish delight licking her lips hungrily, "~Ohhhoohoo, I guess that rumor I heard about darker-skinned humans is true~"Caleb couldn't give a witty retort at the moment as he was too focused on the sensation of her tail stroking him off; a tail job. His eyes widened and jaw slacked paralyzed as Camilla leaned forward dangling her breasts over his face then cupping her hands under them pressing her nipples together."~Now it's your turn to have a taste Señor~", Camilla slyly as she smothered his whole head in her flesh pillows and forcing her nipples into his mouth. The feeling of her tender, creamy flesh enveloping his face, her pink buds against his tongue, and her pleasured moans filling his ears was enough to send his mind into overdrive. He could feel enormous pressure quickly growing in his nether region. He may have actually enjoyed the experience if he wasn't slowly being suffocated.He shook his head trying to shimmy out for air only for Camilla to elicit delighted moans and grip his head tight into her cleavage, "~Ah! Jes Señor, burn the taste of your Destined lover into memory.~"Caleb flailed his arm trying to push her off of him but every touch to her body only aroused and spurred her on even more. He could feel his lungs burning for air and his consciousness beginning to fade. Starting to panic, he hands desperately wandered about for anything that could save him. One of his hands found it's way to her tail and instinctively grabbed it. Camilla eyes shot wide as she gasped in surprise.Caleb yanked her tail from his trousers gripping it tightly and she jerked upwards releasing him with a loud moan. Caleb sharply inhaled finally able to breath and took a few more deep breaths as he realized he was holding Camilla's tail. Looks like he found a weak spot and he was gonna exploit it."S-S-Señor, m-mi t-t-tail is very s-sensitive ahhhhah", Camilla strained trembling hard before dangling her upper body on the couch side digging her claws into the cushions. Caleb held onto her tail firmly as he moved his legs from under her and stood up; each movement he made sending jolts of electricity throughout her body.'Why do I feel like I've seen this somewhere though?', Caleb thought as he pulled and stroked causing Camilla to arched her back shrieking in ecstasy her wings twitching erratically."~Ahh Señor, i-i-its too much Haahh. dulce caos mi cuerpo se siente como un infierno ~", Camilla moaned squirming on her stomach on the couch as Caleb stood over her yanking and stroking her tail even harder. While he felt it was a bit cruel to do this to her, he also knew he needed to tire her out so he could make his escape. Then again, he couldn't deny how awkwardly erotic this was. Her shapely thicc thighs and butt jiggling with every move, smooth flawless back, hand rubbing her smooth, hairless wet pussy-' Oh shit, focus. FOCUS.', Caleb thought as he realized his grib was loosening and pace slowing down. He immediately gripped is harder and stroked more vigorously than before causing Camilla to fall to the floor on her back with a shriek. She moaned and writhed drool escaping the corner of her mouth. Caleb felt his left eye twitch from the sight but closed continued his tail stroking."~Señor! Señor! No puedo aguantarlo más. Estoy a punto de ...(I can't take anymore. I think I'm about to...)~", Camilla spouted tightening hers thigh grip around her hand. Caleb was sure she was about to do what he thought she was going to do and nervously gulped. Without him noticing, the room started to fill with purple mist."Dear!", cried the voice of Mirabelle startling Caleb into releasing Camilla's tail. Caleb paused in shock at Mirabelle's appearance. Camilla stopped squirming and panted heavily lifting her head in confusion as to why her lover stopped pleasuring her.Mirabelle stood on the other side of the couch shrouded in purple mist. Her body painted a dark, imposing silhouette as her the purple glow of her eyes cut through the darkness further adding to her haunting appearance. She glared at them with psychotic disgust before her body a violently shimmering purple aura and the mist instantaneously dispersed. Caleb flinched as her gaze focused on him.Mira-Scope'Caleb stood before her wearing similar attire as when they went on their first date to the botanical gardens. His loving, accepting smile and chocolate brown eyes that could charm the purple off her fur. He opened his arms inviting her into his embrace and she smiled gleefully running to him. Only to stop in her track a look of horror as the man she adored was being embraced by that succubus woman. She kissed and pushed him into her bosom wrapping her tail around him possessively then turned to Mirabelle with a taunting grin, "Señor, why would you want to be with a weak, ugly, selfish coward? When you could have a strong, beautiful woman that would never leave you.'RealityMirabelle clenched her fists with angry scowl and tears in the corner of her eyes. The aura around her body swirled violently and she instantly disappeared and reappeared(think of Harry Potter apparition) behind Caleb; The latter let out a surprised shout nearly toppling backwards. Before he could react, Mirabelle pulls him toward her wrapping his head firmly between her breast. Caleb silently thanked God he wasn't a guy in an anime. Otherwise, he'd be dead from blood loss by now.Mirabelle pulled him up to meet her crazed yet desperate expression, "CALEB PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME. I'm sorry for being weak! I'm sorry for not being there for you! But, I love you! I love you so much! YOU DON'T NEED HER! I'M YOURS BODY AND SOUL! I'LL LET YOU DO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ME! EVEN HIT ME.""What the hell are you talking about!? Snap out of it, THIS AIN'T YOU, MIRABELLE!", Caleb stated trying to pull out of her grip. It was then a feeling a danger crept up his spine. He and Mirabelle noticed an enraged Camilla standing behind them. A bluish-black malevolent aura radiating off her with her wings fully extended, tail whipping about, and her glowing red eyes focused on the pair. All while wearing nothing but her red panties."Unhand mi Destino( my destined one), ju clingy livestock bitch!", Camilla growled in distorted demonic voice glaring at Mirabelle.Mirabelle tensed but glared back at the succubus refusing to back down and lose her Caleb. She pulled Caleb close and teleported with him only for Camilla to a pulse of dark energy that spread throughout the room. Mirabelle reappeared toppling off balance as Caleb fell on his butt looking around while breath rapidly."The fuck was that?! It felt like my body was being forced down a narrow tube and I couldn't breathe!", Caleb said before noticing Mirabelle hunched over and Camilla standing there with confident grin."Ahahahaha, I disable your pathetic excuse for teleporting magic. Der is no escape, now return my lover or face destruction!", Camilla spoke forming a blackish-red magic seal pointing at Mirabelle. The latter flared up her aura stepping to Caleb's side. Caleb was taken out of his existential crisis and focused on the girls."I will NEVER let you have him! He belongs to me! He always has and ALWAYS will! It doesn't matter how strong you are or what you did. HE. IS. MINE!", Mirabelle retorted her eyes now completely engulfed in a purple light and small purple flame-like wisps. Caleb winced slightly from a burning sensation on his chest before looking down in shock at the hoof mark. It glowed ominously with a purple wispy-flame coming from it.Camilla narrowed her eyes at the centaur, "Don't make me laugh. We were bound together by destiny long before even our conception! HOW CAN YOUR FLIMSY CRUSH EVEN COMPARE!", she snarled forming a large black orb of pulsating red miasma energy in front of her palm.Caleb immediately got to his feet in a haste getting between the two liminals, "CAMILLA STOP! YOU TOO MIRABELLE! Get a hold of yourselves! You're both under the effects of the full moon! Neither of you know what you're saying!"The girls ignored him as they stared each down. Camilla by pure instinctive desire to protect what's hers, raised the pulsating orb destruction over and prepared to hurl it at Mirabelle forgetting the Caleb was in the way."I SAID STOP!", Caleb shouted as the hoof burned brightly; a slight glow of purple in his pupils.As if responding to his emotions, Mirabelle reared on her hind legs, "HAHHHH!", she screamed as a her eyes shined a blinding purple light and sent an explosion of purple energy that covered everything from their bodies to furniture to the outside of the house in shimmering purple aura. Caleb stood in a daze before refocusing enough to see the aura that covered his body before soon dissipating. He looked at Camilla who was partially slumped over and stunned; purple sparks pulsating from her body. He then noticed a stream of purple light flow from a large a rapidly receding ball of light, formerly Camilla's death ball, and absorbed into Mirabelle's body. He noticed a second stream of energy coming from the ceiling closely followed by Lyca falling with a loud yelp and hitting the floor. She quickly sat up shaking off the dizziness. She grinned focusing her attention on Caleb before morphing into a vicious snarl upon noticing the demon and evil-looking horse. Dropping on all fours in an attack position, she bared her fangs with Amber eyes filled with rage and ready to lunge at the first one to make a move at her chief."Ah hah hah hahhhh, ju can...absorb as much of...my spells as ju want.", Camilla panted narrowing her anger filled red eyes at Mirabelle then brandished her claws like knives. Mirabelle extended both arms in front of her making a triangle with her fingers. A purple mass of aura formed like the ripple of a pond in front of her palms.Caleb glanced between the three finding it impossible to reach them with words. His heart raced in a panic to come up with a plan. He had to do something! Otherwise they'll kill each other! More death...because of him. Just like...mom and dad.Camilla regained her strength and tucked her wings and lunged at Mirabelle extending her arm like a dagger, "I DON'T NEED THEM TO DESTROY JU!", she screamed in her distorted demonic voice ready to take back her lover. Mirabelle flared her aura and Lyca lunged towards Camilla prepared to rip her apart.Caleb ran in between them, no plan, no life line, just an instinctive desire to protect them from themselves....Before they could even make contact with each other, the front door burst open with a powerful whirlwind that came ripping through and knocking them all away from each other. Camilla tried to dig herself into the floor but Lyca came flying towards her like a ragdoll and slammed right into her sending them both into the dark hallway. Mirabelle crouched to the floor tucking her legs in and shielding her face from strong gusts. Caleb fell backwards about to be blown off to God knows where before feeling an arm snake around his waist. Suddenly, he was being carried...by the wind flying at breakneck speed to the open door. It shut leaving the living room a mess...again and quiet save for the sound of Mirabelle's panting...."Argh! What, what, what the hell?!", Caleb stated sitting on the floor looking around confused by the unfamiliar scenery. After a few seconds, it dawned on him that he had seen this place before, recently in fact."Mr. Bizzell, are you alright", called a familiar feminine voice immediately getting Caleb's attention. It was Ein, his Kamaitachi bodyguard, and next to her sitting bed to them with an amused grin was Zwei, also a Kamaitachi and bodyguard. It was then he realized he was in his bodyguards' house.Caleb stood up as both girl's eyes followed his motions, "Y-Yeah, I'm fine.""You do know tonight is a full moon, right? Liminals tend to get pretttty nutty around this time.", Zwei commented.Caleb gave her a dry look, " 'pretty nutty' she says. More like batshit sex crazy! Sigh, I completely forgot about it so I couldn't give them their sleeping pills.""It was a good thing we got to you in time. Hosts have been badly injured on nights like this.", Ein stated, "Any later and might have accidentally killed you."Caleb shuddered at the thought then eyed them both suspiciously, "Yeah...while we're on the topic, why aren't you guys affected?"The two girls exchanged looks before simultaneously stating, "Willpower?"Caleb raised an eyebrow, "O...k? Now where's a phone, we gotta call MON squad!""We are MON", Ein corrected."I mean we need to call for backup!""Why?", Zwei inquired with an innocent head tilt."What do you mean 'why'?! The girls aren't in control! They could be tearing the house apart looking for me or WORSE tearing EACH OTHER apart! Please, kindly do your job and call for backup!", Caleb stated incredulously.Ein fidgeted touching her fingers together, " Sorry, but we can't do that, they'd only get in the way.""Yeah, besides our job is to guard you. So you have to be close to us.", Zwei said stepping off her seat and walking up to him.A sense of dread crept of Caleb's spine before a thought suddenly occurred to him, "Hey, there are three of you. Where's the shorter one? Drei.""Oh, she was being a downer so we pacified her. Couldn't have her spoiling the fun either.", Zwei finished with a sultry giggle. The two slowly began to close in on him their faces a noticeable shade of red and their eyes gleaming with lustEin-Zwei Scope'The man stood before them shirtless with strapping muscles and dragon tattoo across his chest. He wore hill tribe forest green wind patterned harem pants adorned with a golden chain around his waist. His eyes were fierce like a hurricane yet calm and comforting like a pleasant Summer breeze. "So, which one of you sexy females wants to get stuffed like a Thai chicken wing first.""Goddammit...", Caleb sighed realizing it really was too good to be true. He glanced behind them at the front door that may as well been miles away. With no other options, he bolted for the stairs behind him. It proved to be in vain though as before he could reach the first step, Ein sent a mini shockwave at his feet. It slipped him making him fall flat on his back and hitting the back of his head, not on the floor, but on Eins soft lap pillow."W-what the?! Get the-ACK!", Caleb uttered trying to get up only to be forced back down instantly by Ein who held him down in her embrace seemingly with little effort. Seriously, at this point, his male pride is gonna need to be on life support."~Tch, tch, tch be careful Mr. Bizzell. You never know what could trip you up~", Ein teased as she playfully scratched his sides. Caleb attempted to kick free only Zwei to straddle his knees and brandishing her twin blades. He quickly ceased any motions and watched her carefully as she eyed his crotch with predatory eyes and a lustful grin."~Now hold still Calboy, the fun's about to begin~", Zwei chirped clinking her blades together as mini cyclones formed around her arms."Try to get it all in one go Zwei!", Ein encouraged her face contorting into one delirious lust."All what off?! What is she doing?!", Caleb rapidly spoke in clear panick.Zwei leapt off of him making an X-motion with her arms and fired a torrent of pressurized at his pants."THE FUCK?! WHAT THE FUCK?! WHAT THE FUCK?!", Caleb screamed as the wind ripped at his body slicing his pants to ribbons leaving him in only his boxers. The bits of his pants, even a couple 20s he had in his back pocket, came floating around like confetti. Caleb frowned in horror as he saw Zwei and Ein staring at the bulge on the side of his inner thigh; their ears twitching as they caught the scent of the masculine pheromones from his loins. Drool escaping their mouths in hunger as they smiled in delight."Dibs!", Zwei called making Ein pout from not being fast enough. In a quick motion, Zwei untied the red rope band around her waist allowing her green dress to fall it to the floor. At the same time, Ein pulled apart the straps on her dress allowing her perfect G-cups to bounce freely. Then Ein repositions herself so that she was sitting on Caleb's chest and her knees pinning his arms down securely. Her butt was directly over his face with black tights outlining the shape of her pussy and her bushy tail grazing his scalp. Caleb tensed as he felt Zwei run her hands up and down his thighs.Zwei stood up now in nothing more than her black skin tight bodysuit that showed off her surprisingly curvaceous figure for her size. She immediately grabbed the suit at breast proceeding to rip the entire suit down the middle exposing her perky C-cups and steaming wet clit. She plopped back down aligning herself towards the prize beneath the undergarments. Ein reached down to her rear with both hands grasping the hem of her suit near her crotch. She rips it apart exposing her 6aroused womanhood that radiated heat and her love juice that trickled on Caleb's bare neck. The scent was sweet and intoxicating like honeysuckle. She moved her hips enticing him to have a taste of her.Caleb grit his teeth feeling his last shreds of sanity beginning to crumble but had to give one last shot to reason with them, "GUYS! Just stop already! YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE MY BODYGUARDS DAMMIT!""~That right Mr. Bizzell, we are your bodyguards~", Ein spoke sweetly with an unsettling layer of prurience."~Emphasis on 'body', now let us 'guard' you until we're satisfied.~", Zwei added a flirtatious yet threatening giggle.Both Ein and Zwei smiled deviously with maddened lust swirling their eyes. Caleb thrashed trying to get them off but it proved no use as the both pinned him down good and it only seemed to arouse them more. He shuddered when Zwei stroked the bulge then hooking her fingers on the hem of his underwear slowly pulling them down. He felt Eins hot drool hit his lower stomach as her breathing grew more ragged.Caleb looked up at the ceiling, past Eins swaying bushy tail, despairingly at the humiliation of the situation sank in. Eins knees dug harder into his arms making him wince from the pain.'I can't believe I'm gonna be raped by two Chinese women with animal tails and ears!', Caleb thought before eyes widened in horrid realization, 'OH JESUS, JUST LIKE THE OLD GYPSY LADY DOWNTOWN SAID!""BEGONE...THOT!", called out an unknown voice as Ein was sent flying off of Caleb tumbling backwards after being struck hard in the face. Caleb took a minute to process what happened before using the confusion to rise up and push Zwei off of him.She fell on her back with a 'thud' before a black figure leapt out the shadows and swiftly binded her hands and feet together with rope. The short figure loomed over Zwei before throwing off it's black cloak revealing to be Drei. Caleb stood up watching the exchange."W-what the? I thought we-", Zwei uttered in beffuddlment." 'Pacified me'? No. You forget I'M the one that taught you that knot.", Drei spoke dryly before turning to Caleb who eyed her suspiciously, "They won't stay down for long you know. Come with me if you want to live...to NOT be a human dildo.", she said reaching out her hand to him.Feeling a little thrown off by the comment, but now certain she wasn't affected by the full moon. He bent down slightly to the child-sized wind weasel and took her small hand. It was damp with some kind of oily substance but it felt oddly pleasant. His body began to feel light as if he was filled with helium. Next thing he knew, he was shockingly being quickly pulled by Drei who seem to shoe no signs of struggle before the entered the dining room where the door to the panic room had been opened. They entered closing it behind them.The inside was quite large with the walls being solid concrete and floors covered in a blast-resistant marble coating. There two adjustable red couches with circular glass wood rimmed table between them. There were at least four metallic shelves filled with non-perishable foods, water bottles, multiple appliances still in there boxes, and some firearms with ammunition. There was fridge that was empty save for a few cold sodas inside. Across from the couches were several monitors from hidden cameras around Caleb's house and the Zyklon's. On it the girls, Ein and Zwei, were on the prowl searching for the object of their unbridled affection.Caleb and Drei sat on opposite couches. Drei had a number of assorted herbs and ingredients along with several tools he recognized; mortar and pestle, jars and vials, cheesecloth, funnels, ect. He watched as she mixed and grinded the herbs into oils with very quick precision and attention to detail."Look, I'm not going to mount you the second take your eyes off me.", Drei affirmed referring to how he was watching her cautiously.Caleb sighed cupping his hands around his eyes, "I just didn't want to take any more chances. But, I convinced YOU'RE not one of them. How ARE you not affected by this?"Drei pulled out a small greenish-brown vial, "This a special herbal oil of my own creation. When applied thoroughly on face and body, it blocks the natural enzymes released from a liminals glands that react to lunar flux rays and drive into a frenzy. Thus nullifying the full moons affects. I applied some to myself and advised my sisters to, but I guess they forgot."Caleb blinked at her answer, "Merciful Christ, you should patent this shit!""And sell myself out to greedy corporations that would use low-grade materials to save themselves bucks? No, thank you. Plus, I think it's more ethical than pulling a Hot Cosby, minus the 'Hot', on your guests.", Drei replied, "I couldn't blame you for being suspicious though, judging by your comfortable attire you've had you're hands full. More than any U.S. congressman.", Drei commented looking up and down his almost naked body."Yeah no kidding, I never thought a full moon could be THIS bad. They have no control over their power and they all have this crazed, lustful infatuation with me!", Caleb stated rubbing the stress from his forehead."I've seen this before, many times actually. It's quite common. On full moon nights, a liminal's inhibitions are nullified leaving them to act on their specie's base instincts as well as repressed emotions and desires. I assume your housemates dumped a little baggage on you?", Drei inquired.Caleb scratched his head blushing embarassment, "Ohhhh yeah. So you're saying they're acting this way because they have some pent up romantic and sexual feelings toward me? I mean, it kinda, sorta makes sense with Mirabelle and Camilla. But Lyca? And your sisters I JUST met today, why are they going after me?"" For most liminals, there doesn't have to be any real emotional attachments involved. Even just knowing a person's name would be enough to get them going. They likely attacked you just because you're the only male within a 20 meter radius they a little about.", Drei explained finishing the mixture."Isn't that nice? Now where were you when I was being shamelessly sexually harassed?", Caleb inquired as Drei pounded at the mortar and pestle then added a honey colored oil to it."They tied me up but l escaped fairly easily. Fancy fingers.", She emphasized waggling her fingers proudly, "Plus, I was busy gathering the ingredients I need for this new medicine.""Instead of grinding up medicine like some kind of Furry witchdoctor, how about calling for backup?", Caleb stated stifling his impatience and annoyance.Drei ignores him and begins pouring the brownish-green liquid into the empty vials through the funnels before saying, " I tried, unfortunately, it seems the communication and alarm systems are down. I'm guessing it has something to do with that weird purple aura that spread throughout the house. So, we're up shit's creek without a paddle...and a hole in the canoe."Caleb was about to say something but waved it off, "Then what exactly are you doing?""Well, while you were sitting on your hands bitching like a bitch, I was finishing a salve that would solve our problems.", She spoke filling the last of the vials warranting an agitated scowl from the half-naked human. Two medium vials filled with greenish-brown viscous fluid stood in a row."Is this more of that salve for nullifying the full moon affects?", Caleb inquired."Oh goodness no, that stuff only works before they're completely under the moon's sway. This is a strong sedative that, when absorbed into the skin, can put even a fully grown dragon to sleep.", Drei explained swishing one of the vials around, "There is, however, a bit of a snag in my plan."Caleb raised an eyebrow, "what's that?"Drei stood up and gestured at her body, "I am small. I'm not strong nor speedy enough to outmanuever five horny, unrestrained liminals alone. That short kerfuffle 10 minutes ago was partially because of luck and the element of surprise. So...""So...what?", Caleb inquired."I'm gonna need you to bait them out. With your body. It's the only way to get them all at once", Drei statedCaleb paused facepalming and shuddered in fear at the thought of the girls all swarming and accidentally breaking several bones in a rabid frenzy of lust. But, he was their host and it was his job to protect them, despite the risk of getting fucked to death.Suddenly they heard thumping sounds coming from above them. Drei went over to the monitors and Caleb followed her. On the monitors, Camilla, Lyca, and Mirabelle could be seen entering the house one after another frantically searching for Caleb along with Ein and Zwei."We need to act now. It's won't be long before either of my sisters thinks to check here.", Drei spoke with slight urgency."Alright, I'll do it.", Caleb said a bit uncertain but still determined, "how we doing this now.""Ok, take this vial here. Splash it or rub it anywhere on their body. It'll take a few seconds to take affect. Don't worry about it touching your skin it doesn't affect humans...because reasons.", Drei quickly explained. Caleb nodded in understanding and Drei nodded back.They climbed the large metal stairs that also functioned as an escalator to accommodate certain liminal body types. Drei took a few small black round objects out of her sleeves before pressing a switch on the wall."I'll create a smoke screen. By now my sisters are going to check here, hold onto my hand and we'll both hit them first then go for the others.", Drei said as the floor doors opened with surprisingly little noise aside from subtle machine whirring. As they opened, the image of Ein and Zwei stood above them with the same expressions of lustful hunger. Drei tossed the smoke bombs towards the ceiling and they exploded in a dark cloud of haze and spreading throughout the area. They immediately started coughed on the black smoke as Drei and Caleb quickly ran past them. Drei turned uncorking her vial about to splash it on them. Then, on instinct, Ein put her dull blades together in an inverted cross position and sent a devastating shockwave ripping through the area; blowing away the smoke, shattering a couple windows, and even knocking Drei and Caleb down to the floor."Ahh, cough cough, ahhgh...Drei? Drei you ok?", Caleb groaned as the ringing in his ears died down. He looked around to see the room in utter disarray; Buddhist ornaments and decorations on the floor broken or turned over, table turned over, and two of the front windows blown out. His eyes landed on Drei who stumbled a bit as she stood up."I...I am fine. Only my body took most of the damage, ow my body.", Drei commented leaving out the part about her shielding him at the last second, "Unfortunately, my vial of the salve was destroyed."Drei pointed to the shattered remains of vial with pool of salve on the floor, "What about you? And is your vial intact?"Caleb looked at his vial. It was intact somehow not even a crack; as implausible as it sounds. He shakily stood up and was about to answer when..."THERE JU ARE?!", called the voice of Camilla from atop the stairs before jumping down, her wings parachuting her descent. Then Lyca came bounding out of one of the rooms stopping at the railing to stairs looking down with a wide mouthed smile. She leapt down landing on all fours her lustful gaze locked on Caleb then giving a canine 'yip'. Mirabelle apparated out from one of the rooms; her purple aura still enraptured her body. She smiled lascivious at Caleb as he suddenly felt the mark on his chest heat up. Ein and Zwei emerged from the kitchen swaying sensually like leaves in the wind focusing their gazes on Caleb.Then their eyes turned to Drei standing next to him. The room became heated with flames of jealousy, anger, hatred or a combination of all three as they glared at the obstacle in the way of their happiness."Get away from mi Amor hi rat or I'LL KILL JU!", Camilla hissed form a ball of black-blue energy."Grrrrrr!", Lyca snarled bearing her fangs."Caleb is mine. I won't let you, or ANYONE ELSE have him!", Mirabelle shook with rage her eye glowing purple light and aura flaring."No hogging him to yourself Drei! WE SHARE!", Ein and Zwei yelled in unison a mini whirlwind forming around them.Drei gave them a flat, disinterested expression, "Ok."She then turned to Caleb looking up at him, "Well Mr. Bizzell, it was a pleasure working for you. My only complaint is the insurance plan was terrible."Caleb gulped at her words clenching the bottle. He couldn't let them kill Drei and he couldn't let them harm each other. One option left.'Sometimes the only way, is the hard way', he thought inhaling then exhaling, calming himself and resolving to protect them. It was his policy after all, to help anyone if it's within his means."Drei, this stuff won't affect humans and only needs contact to the skin right?", Caleb inquired.Drei tilted her head, "Yes, that is correct. Wh-", before she could ask Caleb uncorked the vial. Her expression morphed to one of surprise as he dumped the entire content all over his body leaving him soaked from head to toe in her sticky, brown oil. The girls were ready to advance on Drei.He stepped forward and their gazes focused back on him, "Drei, if I don't make it, tell everyone I fell down stairs after coming out of the shower. That seems less embarrassing than what's about to happen."He outstretched his arms with a welcoming, "COME ON MY LOVELIES, DADDY CALEB WANT TO SNUGGLE!", he said last word-singlyThe girl's expressions instantly changed to pure, unabated joy and lust before they simultaneously rushed at him. Each with the unwavering desire to fill themselves with his burning love."Mi Destino! (Destined One)""My Dear Caleb!""Arrrff!(Cheif!)""Babe/Darling!"Each of them respectively called arms stretched with hearts in the multicolored eyes.Drei stood in awe before standing up straight then giving a proud military salute, "I'll tell them you died the most honorable death a man could imagine.", She thought.As they were mere inches from him, time appeared to slow to a crawl to Caleb. He looked above him to the ceiling at a skylight were the moon shined above them.'Huh, all things considered, the moon sure is pretty tonight.'..."AHHHHHH! AH! WOO! APA STOP, GRAAAHHAPA, AYAYAYAYA, TOO HARD, TOO HARD, AGHHH!", Caleb hollered as he was smothered(again) in a prison of wet kisses, soft flesh, breasts, thighs, legs, and butts of various sizes and shapes. Each girl forcefully pressing against him clamouring to be the first to mount his meat rod; which was currently being violently and painfully harassed by numerous hands down his underwear each trying grab it like a prize for themselves while it's owner tried desperately to protect it. The oil making it easier for them all to move around each other no issue. Drei looked on at the enormous pile of oily moving flesh, wings, tails, and fur with a raised eyebrow. She walked past them to the kitchen and retreived a can of sour creme Pringles she 'borrowed' from Caleb. She returned taking a seat and eating them while watching the ensuing chaotic gangbang....hours later...The sun's rays crept through the blinds partially illuminating the room. The aforementioned person lay in his bed stirring awake from the rays of light irritating his eyes into opening. They suddenly shot wide open and he quickly rose up looking around. He realized he had somehow gotten back in his room somehow. He was in his blue plade pajama bottoms with matching top full unbuttoned. He then noticed his arms and legs were bandaged but there was no pain in any of his llimbs. He had some bruises on his neck and chest that still ached a little.'Holy hell, what happened las-', he thought when suddenly the event of the previous night came flooding back to him. Camilla's confession, Mirabelle's confession, Lyca, the Zyklons, everyone going crazy and then dog piling him.He instantly jumped out of bed fearing the worst. Then he heard a crumbling sound and felt something flat beneath his feet. It was folded up note and next to was a jar of light brownish yellow substance. He picked both objects up and noticed the outside had the words 'From Dre to Caleb' written...in very beautiful calligraphic design. He opened in it and it read...Dear Mr. Bizzell or in light of recent events ''Mr. Eros , Good morning, hope you rested well. You should know that the oil worked and everyone was knocked out. Admittedly, longer than expected likely due to their high levels of hormones exerted by their bodies. I need to commend you for stepping up like that btw. You should also know my sisters and you're home stays are all fine. After you passed out along with them from exhaustion, my sisters were the first to wake. I explained what happened and admonished them appropriately. They wanted to make it up so we brought you all back here, treated whatever wounds you guys had, mostly you. However, while I was treating your arms the Succubus and the Centaur woke up and we're distraught to see you in such shape because of them. I guess they remember everything; may wanna check on that. Anyway, that's it and, ignoring recent, we'll do our best to protect you.Signed, DreiP.S. I left a salve to help those bruises heal quicker. No thanks necessary, I just demand a meat lovers omelet for breakfast.Caleb looked at the jar in hand then re-read the part of the note about Camilla and Mirabelle. He closed his eyes inhaling then blowing hard. He placed the jar on the nightstand for later. He walked to his door stopping when he grasped the handle."Alright, gotta go do damage control", he said opening the door and heading down the hall to his homstays.WRHooo boy! Wasn't that a whole lotta fun? I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I did writing it. Tbh, wasn't sure exactly how to end it. I had a few paths I wanted to take, as hinted in my little Total Drama Island intro. Well, my spring breaks up so it's time to get back to classes. Got get that engineering degree somehow, hehe. You guys have been waiting for this and I'm glad it's finally here too. I hope it pleased the inner deviant in you. And with that, remember to comment, fav, follow, Peace FAM!
  
    Chapter Text
    Chapter 15: Damage ControlHeaviness. That's the feeling that pervaded the atmosphere as Caleb took a step down the hallway. As if he was walking straight into the deep end of a public pool...that hasn't been cleaned in three weeks. He stopped and stared down the hallway in deep contemplation. Mirabelle's door to his left, Lyca's door one door down from the bathroom, and further down to the right, across from his office, Camilla's door.Memories of last night flooded his mind. It was simultaneously the most terrifying and...hottest experience of his entire life. They had no control over themselves. They weren't themselves. The intensity of their desire to be with him, the sense of utter helplessness and failure of not being able to protect them. And now...they blame themselves for his irresponsibility. Damn it. Damn it all to hell. He needed to do something. He needed to fix this.'But how?! Where do I even start? ''Hey guys, remember last night when all y'all got the moon beam madness and were only stopped by gangbanging me into unconsciousness while covered in Drei's sleep serum?' Come on.', Caleb thought with a tired sigh. He looked between each of the doors and an idea started to form. Maybe he didn't have to tackle it all at once. He could just see about one at time, talk them each through what happened and smooth it over a little, THEN sit them all down to talk more on how to move past it. It's fool proof! Then again, even that'll probably be a monumental task no doubt. Fuck it, he still needed to try. Now, who should he start with first. He remembered from Drei's note that Camilla and Mirabelle awoke first and immediately shut themselves in out of shame. What about Lyca though? Maybe the medicine kept her under longer?Caleb tiptoed over to to Lyca room and pressed his ear to the door. He could faintly make out the sound of snoring coming from the inside of the room. Perhaps the sleep oil affects certain species differently compared to others or maybe its because Lyca is just a heavy anyway. Either way, he can scratch her off until later. He then refocused his attention to Mirabelle and Camilla rooms glancing at them respectively.'Which one should I talk to first? I mean, both practically confessed they had romantic feelings toward me, albeit to noticeable different degrees. Moon pie I can sorta understand but Camilla? She barely even knows me and vice versa. Hmmm, maybe I'll start with Moon pie first. I at least know her well enough by...', Caleb thought as he made it to her door freezing in place. He thought of the look of sheer desperate lust Moon pie had on her face. Her sad pleas for him to stay with her despite her 'cowardice'. He felt his stomach twist in knots as he realized he was standing in front of her door heaving slightly. He took a deep breath and exhaled clearly whatever stress beginning to form. '...No, I don't. I don't know a damn thing about her. Or what she's going through. ..so...I guess it's time to listen and learn!'He inhaled again mentally preparing himself for whatever was to come as he raised his knuckles up to the door about to knock. Suddenly, to his surprise, the door slowly opened up wide and standing on the other side was Mirabelle; now dressed in her usual light purple long sleeve button shirt and dark purple cloak. The inside of the room was fairly dark with the closed blinds on the window only allowing a few rays of light to seep through. It, combined with the light in hall, was still enough for him to get a good enough look at Mirabelle. Her hair was unusually messy and a closer look revealed the top portion of her collar and breasts were partially wet and wrinkled. She hung her head low to the floor as little whimpers and sniffles could be heard from her quivering form. Caleb's heart sank as he gazed at the sight before him. He shakily reached out to her."Moon pie...?", was all Caleb could say. She gasped jerking her head up meeting his gaze. Her eyes were puffy, reddened and pupils devoid of any life, her cheeks were stained in dried tears, she wore a deep frown, and her once cream-colored skin was now a sickly pale. She looked absolutely miserable. He gulped audibly but stilled himself and gently said her name again while reaching out slowly. Only for her to jump visibly with a squeal and back away from him trembling and holding her arms to her chest securely. She looked...terrified? Not knowing what else to do, Caleb stepped into the room slowly."No. No, no, no, no, p-please. I'm sorry.", She spoke with trembling voice shaking her head. She felt her rear touch the wall gasping at the notion of being cornered. She looked up again with horrified eyes at the image of him closing in on her with those filthy hands. When they were inches away from her, she could practically hear his voice. That awful voice that still haunts her."I-I'M SORRY! Please Jason!", Mirabelle practically begged. However, instead of the feeling of being violated in some way, this sensation felt...warm. She opened her eye to find herself embraced in caring but strong arms. Her head buried in a firm chest and having her head and ears gently petted."Ssssh, it's ok. You're safe Moon pie. You're safe.", Caleb spoke gently comforting the terrified woman before him. Her arms simply dangled to her side like limp noodles as she processed where she was and what was happening. She felt herself slowly calming down. Mirabelle felt him removing his hand from her head and lightly cup underneath her chin and gently force her to meet the pair chocolate brown eyes. It was Caleb. Her dear Caleb, looking back with that same kind and supportive gaze that reminded her all was well; even when it wasn't.However, this feeling was short-lived when she noticed his bandaged arms and legs. She gently pulled away from him removing his hand to his confusion and worry. Memories of what she did replayed again in her mind. The shame of lowering herself to such an obscene degree. All because of her fear, jealousy, cowardice, and self-pity. And now, she had the gaul to compare her Dear to...him?! Caleb...isn't him. He's not! He's NOT HIM! AND HE NEVER WILL BE! How...could she...?"Moon pie, look w-", Caleb sighed taking a step towards her only to be interrupted by Mirabelle."STAY away from me Caleb! Please, I...I don't want to hurt you any more.", Mirabelle whimpered feeling her eyes ache from more tears starting to well up as she receded into a darker part of the room, "Please, just leave. I'm a monster. A monster that'll only bring you instability and sadness. I don't deserve...love. I don't deserve to...to..."Caleb watched in sadness as she sunk down allowing her grief to overtake her. A sight he's more than familiar with. He clenched his fist. He wasn't to allow her to go down that road. He went to the window and pulled the blinds up illuminating the room. He turned to Mirabelle who was huddled behind her large dresser with a now puzzled look on her face. She watched as he walked over to her bed and sat down on the very comfortable hyper elastic polymer cushions draped by bright purple linen sheets."Alright, sit.", Caleb stated patting on the bed. Mirabelle didn't move at first but when she saw the look of genuine care and understanding on his face as he beckoned her to come out, her body unconsciously stepped from behind the dresser. She slowly made her way over to him averting her eyes from his. She then sat next to him making sure to position herself diagonally so her back was to him. Caleb picked up on this and rose up to sit to her left so she was facing him much to her shock. Mirabelle was about to turn herself around again when Caleb stopped her."You know i'm just gonna keep moving right? You don't need to be afraid to look at me.", Caleb reassured. It didn't have much affect as she wordlessly cast her gaze down to her front legs as she fidgeted the hem of her skirt.Caleb thought for a second of how he was going to approach this. He decide maybe it was best to simply put it out in the open.He inhaled scooting a bit closer, "Moon pie, look...last night was not your fault. You couldn't control yourself-", he spoke placing a hand on her back only for her to jerk away interrupting him mid-sentence."You're wrong!", she stated her voice cracking a bit, "I allowed myself to give in. I knew there would be a full moon! But I...I stayed quiet. All because...because...I...was afraid.""Afraid, of what? Moon pie...", Caleb inquired confused and hurt for her." I felt that...last night was my only chance to show you how much you mean to me. Even then, I was still afraid, so I allowed to moon's energy to give me the courage I needed to...", Mirabelle trailed off then inhaled and resumed, "to show you...I had some value. "Caleb listened intently seeing her body tremble, "Mirabelle...""But instead, all I showed were the darkest and most depraved parts of my soul! I-I was just so afraid of losing you that I completely lost it! I...just..just THREW myself at you like some kind of whore! I tried to make you...", her voice became choked up as tears streamed down her cheeks. She let out a strained sob gripping the sides of her head and burying her face in her arms, "I'm...I am no better than him...Oh gods!"Caleb repositioned sitting in front her grasping wrist startling her as he clasped her hands together in front of them. She looked up to him confused only to be met by his serious eyes."Moon pie, you are definitely not a whore and you are NOTHING like that son of a bitch.", he spoke wholeheartedly, "And you don't to worry about losing me, I'm here for you. Whenever you need for anything or just need to talk. I'm here."Mirabelle clenched her fingers pulling her hands away and to her lap looking down despondently, "How can you say that...to someone who can't even promise the same for you?"Caleb paused at her question unsure of what she meant. Then remembered the things she said last night-at first seeming like random emotional outbursts-and then there's her behavior since the incident. He began to piece things together. He looked at her now with a lump forming in his throat for what he was about to ask her."Mirabelle, do you...do you feel guilty about what happened that night?", Caleb inquired afraid of the answer but remaining firm in his resolve. Her only response was pulling her hands into her chest reclusively without uttering a word all while a deep frown appeared on her face. He'll take that as a 'yes'."Moon pie, listen to me, you have no reason to blame yourself for any of that.", Caleb stated, "What happened to me that night was by pure, unfortunate coincidence that nobody could've foreseen.""B-but...if I didn't leave my sailor moon plushie in the park...you wouldn't have had to be out there alone and...", Mirabelle uttered before Caleb cut her off."No, it was ME who made the decision to stay and not go with you guys. It was ME who chose to go help some random stranger who seemed to be in trouble. It was ME who, after miraculously escaping his captors, went BACK to help Camilla and the other devils and putting myself in even more danger. I was afraid, very, very afraid that night would be my last night on earth. But I was even more afraid about what would happen to you and Lyca, and I...couldn't put you and her through that. So don't blame yourself over me being an idiot.", Caleb stated. Mirabelle seemed to calm slightly but was still visibly doubtful."Even so, your life was in danger, but...I didn't do anything to try and save you! I just...stayed under MON protection. Lyca, she went off to save you not even caring about herself. T-then I find out that devil fought to protect you AND saved Lyca from certain death, both of which I am forever grateful for but... All I did was whatever MON personnel told me. I wanted to sneak away, to go wherever you are and keep you safe. But no, I was too much of a COWARD to even muster the nerve to do something so...so...", Mirabelle struggled before Caleb helped her out."Insane?", Caleb flatly stated to Mirabelle's surprise before he continued, "Reckless? Dangerous? That's the best way I can describe it. Mirabelle standing back and letting trained professionals work to save a loved ones life is not cowardice that's sensibility. Lyca running off on her own was reckless. I'm grateful for her protecting me against that Hellhound but doing so almost cost her her LIFE. Me, Camilla and the others had no CHOICE but to fight to stay alive. Think what you will, but know I would've preferred that you and especially Lyca were in MON protection and NOT where I was dealing with that shit. All I cared about at the end of it all was going back home with my girls and try to move on from the whole experience."Caleb unbuttoned his pajamas to expose his chest, "You did not do this to me, those asshole Malones did.", he emphasizes to the bullet scar on his chest."What if you died?", Mirabelle inquired in a low tone."Yeah, 'IF'", Caleb stated, "I'm still here ain't I? Mirabelle, I appreciate how much you wanted protect me but remember it's my job as you're host to protect you. And I believe that proves you have more courage than you realize; just like the time you saved me when those guys harassed us."Mirabelle's eye lit up for a moment as she processed what he said then suddenly cast her gaze away in shame."It doesn't even matter. I made a bloody fool of myself last night.", Mirabelle ashamedly muttered, "Can you really say I have any such courage if I could willfully bring myself to such a pitiful level?"Caleb paused for a moment as he realized he's now walking on eggshells at this point. What he was about to ask next may break both of them a bit...but he had to. Sometimes you have to be willing to break a few shells to save the rest, right? He took a short deep breath and faced her."Mirabelle, last night was insane I will admit that honestly. I saw a whole different side of you that, now that I think, I've only ever seen a glimpse of in my dreams. Seeing it come full view like that was ...overwhelming...and a little scary.", As he spoke he noticed her trembling increase as she held herself tighter. He stilled himself about to break the first eggshell, "But, last night also allowed me to see your pain and the fear you have of losing me. You said some things that caught my attention...espescially when...Camilla was...you know. So I need to ask...are you really afraid she's going to take me away from you?"Mirabelle slowly looked at him with anguished eyes before nodding slightly."It's about what she said last night isn't it?", Caleb inquired to which Mirabelle shook her head slowly."No, not just that. I was afraid because she's...so much better me.", She admitted sadly.Caleb was confused by her statement, "better than you? What do you-""Don't play dumb!", Mirabelle interrupted before her voice went back to a somber tone, "You really haven't noticed how alluring she is. Lovely caramel skin, soft full lips, silky brown hair...human legs...e-even her breasts are bigger than mine. Not to mention, she's strong physically and magically, she's an excellent cook, she's good at housework, and full of experience. She's perfect. She...she would make a much better partner for you...than me."Caleb listened intently with downtrodden expression as she continued."And not just her. Lyca is so much fun to be around. She's energetic, playful, confident, and never afraid to speak up around people. A-And...she's so well-toned and muscular. Even those three weasel liminals assigned as your bodyguards. Their all very powerful and...have more variety to offer in both personality and sex appeal.", Mirabelle's shoulders sunk low as she hung her head in sorrow, " With so many better alternatives...why would you even waste your time on someone as...pathetic as me? Someone with so little to offer."Caleb's eyes widened in shock. She thinks he's going to replace her!He immediately grabbed her shoulders eliciting a startled squeak from her, "Mirabelle, look at me.", he requested but she turned her gaze downwards only for him to cup a finger under her chin lifting it up until her eyes met his."I. DO NOT. WANT. THEM. And no one will EVER take your place.", Caleb stated firmly."How are you so sure?", Mirabelle inquired unconvinced, "You could...just be saying that to spare my feelings."Caleb eyes widened at her speculation before mentally preparing himself to break another shell."Mirabelle, l need to ask. Do you truly...love me?", As he said that Mirabelle visibly tensed, "How you acted last night...d-do I...really mean that much to you?", Caleb inquired expectantly.Mirabelle face flushed a rosy pink before hiding it in her hands, "Yes. I love you. I love you so much...you mean everything to me."Surprised by her answer, he reflexively averted his gaze unsure of himself. That's the first time a girl's ever said anything like that to him and wasn't exactly sure how to respond."But I now know you don't feel the same about me.", She continued, "Whether it's the real world or the dreamscape, you've always distanced yourself when I expressed any affection toward you. Is..is it because deep down...you're repulsed by the idea of being with me?"Caleb immediately turned towards her flabbergasted at her words. The pained look on her faces as tears streamed down her cheeks made his heart race in panic. He hated that he was doing this to her. He hated it so much. He exhaled slowly his heart still pounding but his mind calming enough to think. It's time he told her."You really believe that, don't you?", Caleb inquired only to be met with silence, "You're right, I have been distant whenever you get that close to me. But it wasn't out of disgust Moon pie, I was afraid. Not just because of the laws against human-liminal romantic relationships.", Mirabelle looked up with a sadness but also curiosity, "I was afraid of getting too attached to you. Afraid of wanting you to be a part of my daily life. Afraid of getting to know a lot about you. Afraid of seeing the beauty in you. ...Afraid of you...seeing the ugliness in me. You've been in my dreamscape multiple times since you've been living here, Moon pie. I know...you've seen them; or at least glimpses."Mirabelle listened intently mouth slightly agape. She knew exactly what he meant. She would sometimes witness these images that would seep through their dreamscape. In them, Caleb was younger with...a look of deep depression. She would also see glimpses of people she never met before but could feel a sense of...regret? Hatred? Blame? Or a combination of unpleasant feelings that would appear and quickly vanish overshadowed by their imagination. There was no denying it, those were his subconscious fears born from unpleasant memories."I'm not ready to tell you everything just yet but I will tell that...I was afraid that if I got too close you'd learn what I really am; and you would reject me like everyone else. But in doing so, all I've done is make you question if you really mattered. I'm so sorry.", Caleb said as tears rolled down his cheeks. Mirabelle eyes widened in surprise."Dear?...", Mirabelle uttered shakily reaching out unsure if she had any right to comfort him. Suddenly, he gingerly took her hands and she looked up with curious eyes.Caleb dried his eyes with his bandaged arms before shooting her a serious look, " I also want to tell you that you don't need to prove or force yourself to do anything for me, or anyone. I more than accept you just the way you are.""But...you saw how much of a pathetic mess I was last night.", Mirabelle uttered in a low tone."Mirabelle, I would describe the way you acted using any word BUT 'pathetic'. In a slightly deranged way, you were a woman willing to do everything in her power to show the man she loved how much he means to her. Actually, when I put it that way, I...think it's pretty heartwarming that someone cares for me to such an extent. I know I know, I sound crazy but you know what? Screw it, I could care less.", Caleb stated as Mirabelle stared at him with complete interest. She scooted closer to him never breaking eye contact with little traces of uncertainty in her eyes."B-but Caleb you saw me. You saw how terrifying I could be. I'm still horrified at the damage I could've done if you were sleeping! Can't you see I'm dangerous? I...just don't want to hurt you. You're much better off with someone safer. Lyca, Camilla, or even those weasels are better options than me.", Mirabelle stated as her trembling eyes began to water once more.Caleb closed his eyes with a sigh, "Moon pie, sweetheart, you forget you weren't the only one acting up last night. Lyca nearly made a paraplegic. Camilla nearly suffocated me. Even my quote-on-quote 'bodyguards' nearly broke the bones in my body. All you did was enthusiastically cuddle me. Yes, you each are dangerous in some way but not enough that I don't care for each of you and want us to spend time together. You are no different. In fact, I treat your happiness as one of my top priorties."Mirabelle went silent with her mouth agape motioning like a fish out of water. Her mind frantically tried to come up with reasons she shouldn't be with him. All the while, she could feel a warmth building in her chest the longer she gazed at him. T-there had to be something. The way she feels...its too good for her. She doesn't deserve this. She even compared him to..."B-b-but...I don't...I don't deserve...", Mirabelle stuttered before he clasped her hands tighter pulling them towards silencing her once more."You are much more than you believe, Mirabelle. The day I met you, I kept discovering new things I liked about you. I like your voice; it's so soothing and the meekness in it makes you so approachable. Even when you stutter, there's still an air of approachability around you. I like your hands; they're so soft and full of kindness. There's always a nurturing sensation in them like when you tend to plants. It makes me feel I can really trust you. I like your eyes; when you look at me they're filled with tenderness and amiability. Even when you're nervous and they waver a bit, I can still tell there is love behind them. I like how you walk. When we walk together shoulder-to-shoulder you try to always match my pace so as to not step on my foot, move too far ahead, or move too slowly. You always want to be right by my side. I like your enthusiasm when talking about your interests, especially Sailor moon. It's so enthralling to see you so passionate and full of excitement when explaining them. That look of pride and joy you have is so beyond description. I like the way you eat. Whatever I make, you always take your time enjoying every last bite and appreciating the effort I put into meal. It makes me proud that someone enjoys my cooking that much.", Caleb smiled and let out a short giggle, " And last night, you shown there's STILL more to you. You can freakin teleport and have some kind of energy absorption powers? This on top of being a Dream Master, makes you one of the coolest people I ever met! I'm so happy I can't stop finding reasons why I love...you..."Caleb paused as he thought as his smile soon vanished with his expression morphing into bewilderment. Did...did he just say? He then noticed Mirabelle staring at him in unfettered anticipation. Her eyes sparkling brightly and filled with hope."You...you said it.", Mirabelle whispered as he cheek flushed bright pink, "After all this time...you finally said it.", as she uttered this tears began forming the corners of her eyes.Caleb open his mouth to try and refute this only to find the words wouldn't come. He pondered to himself for a second looking at her expectant gaze. He closed his eyes and let out a deep sigh. He's come this far, may as well break a few more shells., "...Yes, I do. I do love you Moon pie. I guess I always have but...I was too scared to act on it. And, just to make myself clear, it's...not that Agape Christian kind of love or a that pragmatic kind of love from my duties as a host family. No, I love you...in a way that I cannot imagine my life without you. I need you in my life. You know what my days used to be like? I led a dead existence. I got up, went to work, and came home went to sleep before doing it again and again on endless repeat.I rarely socialized or went out, ate the same foods everyday, and found myself feeling more and more alone. Not that I didn't deserve it. You changed me Moon pie. You brought something into my life that I only later realized was lacking; purpose. I honestly don't want to know what I would've done if I continued to live like that.", he spoke his voice breaking a bit before he wiped the tear from his eye; steadying himself enough to continue, "So please, don't sell yourself so short ever again. Otherwise, the list I have is just gonna have to get longer. I guess all I'm trying to say is...I want you be my girlfriend? ", he finished beaming a sheepish grin at her.Mirabelle literally stopped breathing as soon as those word hit her eardrums. She slowly brought her hands to her chest with her heart feeling like it's about to explode. Her face grew redder than a tomato and her eyes glistened like purple starlight."C-c-c-caleb...is this really ok? How I feel right now...but I...I can't help it. Isn't it wrong for someone like me to be THIS happy?!", Mirabelle inquired with tears in her eyes but an adorable smile."You say it like you committed a crime. You deserve to be happy Moon pie and I want to make you happy. But I guess you are guilty of theft; being so damn adorable you stole my heart.", Caleb said with a loving grin.Mirabelle rose up getting closer to him. Time to show a bit more courage, "Caleb dear I...I really want to kiss you right now. A real kiss...not like last night when I wasn't...""Well, I'm right here and I think we're all entitled to a do-over every now and again.", Caleb stated with a sly grin cupping her cheek softly making her eagerly swoon from his touch. Mirabelle closed her eyes and pursed her lips leaning in with anticipation. Caleb a second to admire the sight before enrapturing her lips unto his. The two held this position for a couple moments before Mirabelle got a bit more daring and stuck her tongue begging for access to his mouth. He happily accepted and the two lovingly savored each others embrace. Mirabelle wrapped her arms around his neck pulling him closer but still remaining submissive enough to let him take the lead. Caleb noted how she even tasted different from last night; sweeter somehow.The two eventually parted to gazed at each other.Mirabelle's grinned happily her cheeks were still flushed red and she kept fidgeting while taking repeated shy glances before dissolving into an uncertain demeanor, " D-Did I do ok? Was it...enjoyable? I-I-I haven't brushed my teeth yet so..."Caleb placed another kiss to her lips much to her surprise but effectively silencing her. He released at her dazed expression with an supporting grin, "It was perfect."Mirabelle relaxed once again at ease and beamed a delighted smile at him. He was so good at reassuring her that all was well. Caleb stared at the woman before him with unfettered admiration. Now this, this is his Moon pie.Suddenly, a thought just occurred to Mirabelle, "Um, Caleb dear? I just remembered when I woke up, I was back in our home. The Zyklons explained to myself and...Ms. Sartana what happened in more detail. Lyca was still unconscious so they took her back to her room. We saw you on the couch unconscious being treated by Ms. Drei. I was so distraught I ran to my room without a word. But... I could also hear Ms. Sartana crying as she passed my door before slamming her's. I...was wondering...h-how is she now?"Caleb's eyes widened like dinner plates, '''Shit!", He internally cursed himself realizing he almost forgotten about Camilla. He quickly composed himself enough to answer her."I'm not sure, but...probably not to be honest. I was going to see about her after checking on you though.", he explained as Mirabelle look away with a pensive expression."I see.", Mirabelle uttered casting her gaze downwards "Last night, she and I...we acted so terribly. And Lyca, we just started really to understand and get along with each other. I don't know I'm going to face them again! What if they hate me now!? What if they-'"Caleb tapped a finger on her head and she instantly refocused on him."Begone bad thoughts!", Caleb stated in a purposely over-the-top deep voice. Mirabelle blinked in confusion. "Hey now, don't worry. I'm going to talk to both of them and smooth over last night events. After that, all of us, you, me, Camilla, Lyca, and the Zyklons are going to sit down in the living room and work this all out. We can move forward from this, ok? You trust me right?""Y-yes, with all my heart.", Mirabelle stated sweetly, "B-but...when you speak with Ms. Sartana... I mean what if she..."Caleb interrupted already sure of what she's going to say, "I won't let it happen. I promise you. I love you, Moon pie and I want you. You're not going to lose me, ever."Mirabelle thought for a second before nodding and looking at him with trusting eyes, "Yes my love, I believe in you.""Alright.", He stated as he stood up; stretching and popping his back as his muscles had stiffened from sitting in that position too long. Mirabelle slowly got up as well with Caleb helping her up by the hand( admittedly pointless since she had four legs but the gesture was still appreciated). He"You should probably get changed. That top looks pretty...damp. Afterwards, I need you to wait in the living room for a bit. I'll go...talk with Camilla first then Lyca. ", Caleb stated walking backwards over to the door with her following him. He stopped grasping the doorknob from behind then leaned in pecking her on the cheek, "Pray for me, I'm probably gonna need it"...She smiled and nodded wordlessly at him as he opened the door and stepped out. He making a gesture with his hand winking at her before saying, "Lali-ho?". Mirabelle smirked at him making the same gesture responding with, "Lali-ho." He nodded and closed the door in front of her leaving her alone. Exhaling blissfully, she turned around to find a shirt that wasn't soaked in tears before something on the floor caught her attention. It was the Sailor Moon plush Caleb won for her. She carefully picked it up ruminating over the events from 4th of July until now. Her thought eventually focused on one phrase that kept repeating; 'I love you'. She smiled affectionately hugging the plush tight. "I love you too", she uttered softly....Caleb inhaled slowly feeling a surge of vigor surging through him. As he made his way for Camilla's room, a smilr was plastered on his face as he couldn't contain his excitement and happiness at the moment. Mirabelle was his girlfriend now! It's a dream come true, literally. After that little heart to heart cession, he's feeling a bit more confident about his approach towards Camilla. 'Ok, just gotta clear the air between us, acknowledge what happened, and move on, rinse and repeat. I can do this. I can totally do this. It gonna...be...', Caleb thought as he slowed to a stop upon noticing a blue leather suitcase sitting next to Camilla's door. The same one she had when she first moved in. He sighed lugubriously as he resumed walking until he was looking down at the suitcase. 'This is gonna be tougher than I thought', he rued before bending down to pick it up. At that moment, the door swung open and out stepped the tall succubus herself. Her attire consisting of blue and black capris, a light blue V-neck shirt, and brown ankle boots. Her wings were once again folded in like a cape; which actually complemented her outfit well.She bolted out of the room clearly in a haste before turning around to close the door. A large blue drawstring bag was slung behind her back. All the while muttering unintelligible distressed Spanish. She reached for her suitcase only to find it being held by someone else. Her panicked expression intensified as she finally noticed Caleb standing there holding her suitcase with quizzical look."S-Senor...", Camilla uttered her voice straining a bit as guilt and shame began to appear on her face, "Ju are...awake? I-I'm glad.""Yeah, me too. But nevermind that, where are you going so early in the morning?", Caleb inquired twirling her suitcase with his wrist, noting that it was fairly light.Camilla managed to compose herself enough to put on a more serious disposition but kept her eyes averted from his and spoke coldly, "It does not matter. I will be out of your life immediately. Now, please, my suitcase..."She reached for her suitcase only for Caleb to pull it behind his back, "Whoa, whoa, whoawhoawhoawhoa, uh uh, no you are not. Do you realize how much trouble we'd both get in if you went out on your own? And you JUST got into ICEP's system. That not a good combination."" Then I'll say I ran off while ju and the others were asleep. If they catch me, then...I'll allow them to...take me out of this country. Ju will no longer be responsible for me but I am forever grateful for all my have done for me. Now please, my things.", Camilla quickly explained before attempting to grab her suitcase again only for Caleb to pivot behind her."I'm sorry but that's not going to happen Camilla.", He stated walking into her room with the suitcase. He placed the suitcase on the bed looking over shoulder slightly to make sure she sees and slowly unbuckled the latches. Then Camilla slammed her palm down on the suitcase glaring at him menacingly making him sweatdrop."Senor, what are ju doing?! Don't just go through a woman's belongings!", Camilla stated in irritation."I wasn't really going to, I just needed to get you in here so we could talk in private.", Caleb said noticing her irate expression morph into a somber frown. Her gaze then shifted to the floor."There's...nothing to talk about. Nothing I say will EVER excuse all I've done.", Camilla stated grimly before locking her suitcase and turning around to leave again."But we can still move on from it. Please l just want to talk about last night.", Caleb said as he put himself between her and the doorway.Camilla tensed up at those words refusing to look at his face, "I said...there's nothing to talk about! Now leave me alone!", she stated her voice cracking slightly as shoved past him. Caleb grabbed her by the arm stopping her as she turned with a stunned expression."I can't do that. I won't leave you when you're suffering like this.", Caleb spoke softly as Camilla froze from the compassion in his eyes.She could've easily ripped her arm away but...she felt paralyzed by the genuine energy he exuded. What's worse, her heart began palpitating the longer he held her. A feeling she's beginning to despise. She's tried all this time to tell herself he's just a man. A tool for amusement or to feed her magic. No different from every other she's ever seen in her time in this world. Weak. Easy to manipulate. Greedy. They are all the same!She watched with frustration on her face and trembling shoulders as he positioned himself in front of her again, subsequently, releasing her arm. She snatched her arm back clutched her fist in anger. Her demonic eyes trembling with her frustration brewing the longer he stood in her path. Why was she hesitating? He can't stop her, no one can! She's disposed of men like him like insects and...she can...do the same. Right?She raised her arm at him forming a bright red magic seal, "l-I won't tell ju again...Caleb...get out of my way...or...I will...I will...", her voice choked and her arm trembled slightly. Admittedly, Caleb became a little afraid but slowly moved towards with never breaking eye contact. Her menacing black and red eyes quivered as she watched him and her breathing rose with the rush of adrenaline rushing through her. Shutting her eyes, she prepared to use the spell. It was then she felt a hand gingerly clasp her own. She opened her eyes to see him holding her hand through the still swirling magic seal."Listen Camilla, it's...ergh ok. I'm not ergh mad about last night. I only...wanted to talk to you because...I felt...you must feel really guilty and depressed. I want to help you so please...let me.", Caleb uttered as he winced from the pain from the seals contact with his skin. It felt like needle constantly pricking every inch of his hand. He really should've thought that through a little more. The hostility in Camilla's eyes melted away and was replaced with profound sadness and fear. Why...why was this human so willing to do all this...for her?The seal around their hands dissipated, much to Caleb's relief who began awkwardly massaging the pain away. Camilla dropped her suitcase and bag to the floor as her shoulders drooped and arms hung limply to her sides in defeat. The depression and anguish on her face as she cast her face downwards reminded Caleb of a starving stray kitten left on the streets to fend for itself. Suddenly she collapsed to her knees with her brown locks obscuring her face and tail wrapping around her waist like a security blanket.Caleb immediately rushed to her aid kneeling in front of her ready to assist, "Camilla, are you Ok?!""Why?", Camilla uttered, "Ju comfort me...after seeing what I truly am?"Caleb paused at her question before replying, "If you're referring to last night...I believe that's how you were ACTING but I don't think that's the real you.""Then ju are a fool. If ju cannot see me for the evil creature that I am", Camilla spoke contemptably, "I...I attacked ju and...I tried to rape ju."That word left a foul taste to Caleb's ears. The memories of her pinning him to the couch and the...forced breast feeding flashed through his mind making him even more uncomfortable and embarrassed. This conversation was definitely going to be harder than he thought."I even attacked mi companara de cuarto (roommates), I...I tried to kill one of them.", Camilla uttered as she choked up in disgust towards herself, "Ju all accepted me here...and I...I..."Caleb shook himself from his thoughts. He needed to push that down for now. There's a despairing woman in front of him that desperately needed help. He quietly inhaled and exhaled deeply mentally preparing himself to give it his best."Camilla it's ok, I know you must be feeling horrible about what happened. Trust me, the others feel the same but we can get through this together.", Caleb stated reaching out to her only for his wrist to be grabbed her hand. It wasn't tight enough to hurt him but it did prevent him from getting closer. She looked up at him with cold and stern eyes before pushing his hand back towards him."Ju speak as though I belong here.", she scoffed swatting his hand away before standing up from her position, "When de truth is I belong nowhere!" She exclaimed walking over to the corner of her room near the window to what appeared to be a canvas with multiple pencil drawings set around it. She lay her hand on the canvas in deep thought while Caleb slowly approached her from the side. He saw that many were drawings of detailed landscapes and mountains, houses and towns, random people on horses or in , and some portraits of individuals."Camilla, did you draw all of these yourself? They're incredible.", Caleb asked in amazement."Heh, Jes, I suppose so.", Camilla spoke indifferently."What are they, like, do they hold any kind of special meaning?", Caleb inquired."Dey are mi memories. Each one, a story of mi journey through mi home country.", Camilla spoke, "I was drawing as a hobby since I was very little and it became mi way of remembering how far I'd come."Caleb peered over her shoulders at a the canvas she plaintively touched the edge of. On was a drawing of a woman; a succubus woman. He noticed she...looked a lot like Camilla save for having a set of four horns instead of two."Camilla...that woman...is she...?", Caleb stated cautiously worried he may be treading into dangerous territory."She is...was mi Madre.", Camilla spoke.Feeling a bit more confident, he decided to push a little further, "She's beautiful. You...look a lot like her, it's almost uncanny."She smilled weakly, "Gracias...but honestly, I never thought of myself even half as stunning as her. Strong, kind, powerful, cunning and proud. She was truly a marvel of our kind.""What was was her name?", Caleb asked now curious."Jimena dalerosa Hema Sartana.", Camilla stated as Caleb smiled at how beautiful it. Though he couldn't say it as...lovely as she could."Do you...do you miss her?", Caleb inquired cautiously."Jes...Not a day goes by...when I don't wonder where she is right now.", Camilla ruminated looking up at the window to the cloudy sky.Caleb looked down with a forlorn expression. He understood how she felt. Ever since...that day he's thought about his mother. Things left unsaid, memories that could've been had, seeing her reaction to the kind of man he had become. All of these lost to them...forever. Caleb shook his head driving out these thought; now wasn't the time, he needed to focus on Camilla."Camilla...if you don't mind me asking, what...did your father do to your mother?", Caleb asked swallowing feeling he may be poking at a very sensitive nerve. His fear seemed to be confirmed when a black aura appeared around Camilla's body as she tightly clenched her fists. She turned to him with anger in her eyes and he gulped and got ready to apologize and hopefully drop the subject."He made her life miserable just for giving birth to me! He knew how much the other females resented her; everyday they harassed and tormented her. Instead of help her he only spurred it on just to amuse himself! There were days when I found mi Madre nursing fresh bruises or weeping in private.", Camilla growled angrily with shaking shoulder before her aura died down, "But...she would always put on a smile and letting me know all was well. Then one day, that bastardo went on violent tirade and tried to take out his frustration on her. I tried to defend her but I was beaten until mi Madre finally had enough and attacked him with her magic. He had us thrown out that same day. I still remember the other females snickering as we left. "Caleb was taken aback failing to find the words to describe what he felt. Or what she meant by other females."We spent all of time searching for a new place to call home but, because of the war among the humans, villages and towns were ravaged. Despite that, my mother assured that we would be ok. It didn't matter how much we had to steal, how much death we saw, or how tired we became, she remained determined and proud. Always reminding me of our pride as beings of discord and chaos that never submit to mortal folly! Her smile didn't waver and I always felt safe looking at her. I wanted nothing more than to keep us safe. I punished anyone who dared pursue us. I made them pay any way I could. No one was going to hurt us ever again!", She suddenly went silent, "But as time went on...she began to use her magic less and less. She also didn't smile as much. T-there were even times...she wouldn't look at me and when she did...there was dis shame in her eyes. Then O-one day...I woke to find that she was nowhere in sight. I searched for her for days but...she was gone. Not a word spoken or letter saying goodbye. Nothing.", she strained out before crumbling the picture of her mother on the stand.Caleb's heart sunk watching her holding her trembling form as she tried desperately to hold back her sob. He slowly approached from behind."Camilla...I'm so-", he said gently laying a hand on her shoulder before ripping herself away facing toward him with a pained expression. She looked on the verge of tears."NO, JUST STOP! Can't...can't ju see there is something wrong with me?! I'm a monster! A murderous, vile creature capable of only inflicting pain on others; whether they deserve it or not! E-even...hic...even mi Madre could see that. She suffered so much all because of me! Everything I've been through, the humiliation I endured, the cruelty I received, it's what I deserve! It's ALL I deserve!", Camilla reviled herself shutting her eyes to block the tears welling up."Camilla-", Caleb said reaching out to her before being cut off again by the hysterical demoness who shot him a half-furious-half-morose look."WHAT?! ARE JU GOING TO SAY I DON'T?! Ju experienced the harm I can do to ALL of ju! Haha and to be so pathetic to believe someone like ME could ever have a Destined One?! Wishful thinking as always! W-why are ju really here human? Is it to calm me down before having your precious ICEP swine throw me out? Or did ju want to berate me about last night? Or maybe ju want revenge? Well GO AHEAD, PUNCH ME, CUT ME, BURN ME, KICK ME, IT'S ALL BEEN DONE BEFORE. If it makes ju feel better, COME ON, DO IT!", Camilla shouted at the human man before closing her eyes and lowering her defenses expecting whatever pain he wanted to inflict on her. A few moments passed as she waited for whatever harm to come. She tensed up feeling his hands rest on her shoulders; she inhaled readying herself. She let out a squeak as her body was pulled forward and his arms wrapped around her back. Her eyes shot open in surprise as she realized he was holding her. His embrace was firm but also...warm. It was beyond her comprehension. Then he did something she really wasn't expecting."~Just a small town girl, living in lonely worrrrlllld, she took the midnight train goin' annnyyywherrre.", Caleb sung petting Camilla's head gently avoiding her horns as he did so. The latter raised an eyebrow in confusion as he continued, 'Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit, he took the midnight train goin' annnyyywherrre~"He pulled away enough for her to look at him with a dumbfounded expression."Q-què eres...I mean, what are ju...w-why...?!, Camilla struggled as tried to understand what was happening. Her eyes widened in surprise as he grinned nervously."Heh s-sorry I kinda panicked there and...needed help you relax and well...that was the first idea that popped into mind.", Caleb explained meekly rubbing the back of his head, "It looks like it kinda worked though so...yay?"Camilla confusion only grew at his strange actions. Was is with this human? Is he mocking her or something? But the way he speaks feels so genuine.Caleb let out a sigh composing himself, "Camilla, listen, I won't pretend I could ever understand how much you've suffered. You've seen the worst of humanity long before I was even conceived. The very notion of that alone would be enough to break me. I've never met your old man...but he sounds like a dick, a capital DICK and it was wrong how he treated you and mother. Plain and simple. And I don't know the real reason your mother left you alone for all that time nor will I guarantee we'll ever know. And I won't lie and say what you told about...how you treated those men from your past or...how you behave during the full moon didn't scare me, it did, quite a bit."Camilla cast her gaze away from him, "Then...ju know I cannot stay-""But I wasn't scared of you(for the most part)", Caleb stated cutting her off, "I was scared of what would happen to you and the others. I didn't want any of you getting hurt, no matter what I had to do to ensure that."Camilla was taken aback by his statement but was still uncertain, "But why? Why should my life mean anything to ju?""Camilla, I know I said I can't fully understand how painful it was for you, but I do understand why you did those things. When you're surrounded by those who only want to hurt you and try to make you ashamed of who you are, it's natural to want to give back that pain. You don't want to feel weak so you hurt them before they could hurt you. I know that feeling. I don't believe you're a monster Camilla. It was your circumstances forced you to change. You were willing to do what you needed to protect your mother and yourself in a war torn environment. The need to survive drives people to do some messed up things. I won't say you're actions were entirely justified...but I'm certain if I were in your shoes, I probably would have done the same, maybe even worse somehow. I'm not going to hold your past against you Camilla and that includes last night. So, come on let's work to move on from it...together.", Caleb finished holding his hand out to her.Camilla stood there floored by his offer. Her demonic red eyes fixated on him curiously. After a moment she finally spoke sadly, "But... I... I am a demon. The only thing I'll do is bring ruin upon your life just like other men before ju. Please, just let me go. I don't belong here."Caleb chuckled surprising her before speaking, "Well you're kinda late. My life was already fairly ruined before any of you came. The only way it could get worse is...if any of you weren't here.", He finished in a humble tone. Camilla looked down vociferously and slowly clenching and unclenching her fist now uncertain of what to do."I...I don't believe ju. I...just cannot-gasp", Camilla uttered slightly startled when Caleb clasped her hand in both of his. She didn't know what kind of magic he was using but she became petrified fixated solely on his chocolate brown eyes."It ok if you don't. I couldn't expect you to put so much faith in just another man. Especially one you barely know still. But you can believe this. No matter what you choose, just remember, you are ALWAYS welcome here. As long as I'm here, this will always be your home. Whenever you are hurting, hungry, or just feeling lonely, I-WE are here. That is my promise to you.", Caleb stated assuredly gently squeezing her hand, "And if I EVER break that promise...you have my permission to put a curse me. Er, that is assuming you can do that at least. Not sure where the line is drawn with magic. ", he finished with a comforting smile.Camilla stared at him as a torrent of emotions flooded her senses making her unable to form coherent thoughts anymore. All she could focus on now, was the young man before her who is willing to accept her into his life; no strings attached, ulterior motives, or out of fear. There was no sign of falsehood in his voice nor subversive intent behind his warm smile. It was an anomaly Camilla had never encountered before. Her heart wouldn't stop racing and her legs became like jelly struggling to keep her standing. She once again collapsed to her knees, only this time, Caleb managed to catch her in his arms."Whoa hey now, can't have ya fallen out so-", Caleb stated before falling silent when the succubus gripped him in a tight hug with her claws digging into his back no doubt leaving holes in the fabric. She buried her head in his chest; her horns pressing a bit uncomfortably in his left pectoral but he endured it. Her breasts mushed into his abdomen; which He also endured by focusing on the pectoral pain. He felt her body tremble with every partially muffled hic and snivel that went into her sobs. Her tears making the side of his chest damp and warm. Caleb instinctively began gently petting the top of her head; only curiously brushing the horns a couple times noting how they were surprisingly smooth like stone from a river. She pulled her head up meeting him with tear stained eyes, contorted pleading expression, and quivering bottom lip."Gracias...Senor...I've waited...and waited so long...to hear those words. I had given up. Then ju...", Camilla uttered between sobs before burying her face in the crook of his neck and wailing hard. She tightened her already spine shattering hug even more which Caleb slightly hissed from before returning with his own hug; smiling through the pain."Please...please don't hurt me.", Camilla whispered almost fearfully."Not a chance in hell", Caleb reassured stroking her wings and back gently. Camilla pulled off his neck and beamed a content grin with her teary eyes filled with admiration. She brought her hands caressing his cheeks much to his surprise. His eyes widened when she, through closed eyes, inched closer to him with lips parted eagerly. He swallowed feeling his mouth become dry as he lips hovered mere inches from his. He grit his teeth before placing a finger to her lips causing her eyes to shoot open in confusion and worry then released his face.Caleb sighed looking away, "Camilla, I'm sorry...but...I can't...D-don't get me wrong, you are really beautiful. Enchanting in fact, no pun intended. ...But the way things are now, there are too many reasons why I can't do this."Camilla turned her eyes away dejectedly before muttering, "Is Señorita Mirabelle one of them?"Caleb paused realizing how she had already caught on. It wasn't like it was that big a secret in retrospect, but it still caught him off guard. Oh well, may as well own up."Yes, she is. Despite what ICEP'S laws say, I...I love her. As corny as it sounds, I kinda fell for her before I even realized I did.", Caleb stated feeling a bit awkward telling this to another person but not denying it."Heh, that is pretty lame.", Camilla giggled weakly forcing a smile before finding the nerve to looking at him directly, "I've seen how ju two are around each other. It is cute. She...she is very lucky to have ju. I...think I envy her."Caleb became unsure how to approach the next subject but decided to give it a shot, "Camilla...about the whole 'Destined One's thing, I'm still firm in my belief that no one is meant for anyone. That doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad thing. It means we are all free to choose the person we want to be out partners.""Jes, but, mi problema is that...fate or not...i've already met the one I wish to be mi companero. Ju have been so kind and accepting of who I am. I think ju are a wonderful person so...", Camilla paused in thought for a moment, "Señor if...things do not work between ju two...would ju give me a chance to win your heart?"Caleb shook his head slowly much to her dismay, "Camilla, no one's heart is a prize to be won, that isn't how it works. A person has to willingly accept others into their hearts: either as friends...or lovers.", Caleb unbuttoned the side of his pajamas to expose the hoof mark as Camilla's eyes widen in intrigue , "Plus, I don't want to betray the faith Moon pie has in me.""S-she has marked you?!", Camilla scooted closer to examine the mark; she had never seen a symbol like this before."Yeah, it's kind of a custom among her clan to mark those they trust with all their hearts. It gets darker the deeper our relationship grows. See? It used to be a couple shades lighter than my skin now it's way darker like obsidian or something.", Caleb explained intentionally leaving out part about dreams.She reached out to gingerly to touch it, with Caleb's permission, to second she felt it she felt the surge of powerful stored mana, "What is this energy? It's so concentrated and...full of life. As if, part of her very soul is bound to ju! This particular kind of spell stores emotions and slowly converts them to magical energy. But...the amount that is built up now would've taken years; she's lived her only a few months. How is dis possible? ", Camilla paused in disbelief. She trusts him so much, she's willing to hinder her own potential? Just how deep is their bond?"Not sure what you mean, but in a way, I guess you can say she's the girl of my dreams.", Caleb stated smirking to himself."Then...there is no chance for me. That woman has your heart already.", Camilla uttered in defeat. Caleb changed his position so her was slightly above her, to Camilla's shock, he placed a kiss to her forehead. Not much, just a peck so Caleb could affirm her position. Caleb stood up straight as Camilla sat on her knees looking up with hopeful eyes and deep blush in her face."Come on now, weren't you listening about people needing to willingly accept others in their hearts? I may not love you in a romantic sense, but I do love you as a close friend, Camilla. However, the best I can offer in terms of physical displays of affection are platonic hugs and ocassional kisses to the cheek or forehead. I hope that's ok.", Caleb finished offering his hand to her. She grinned happily accepting as she stood up meeting him at eye level...sorta(She was almost a foot taller than him), "One last thing we should discuss.""Of course Señor, what is it?", Camilla inquired eagerly."All of us are meeting in the living room to discuss what happened last night. I think it's important that we all move on from this together.", Caleb said as Camilla backed away taken aback by the idea of confronting them again, especially Mirabelle."Señor, I'm not sure about that. Ju remember I tried to...to hurt them; even tried to the woman ju love so much. How can ju expect me to face them? I am surprised ju can even stomach the sight of me.", Camilla spoke timorously cradling her arms and looking away pensively."And yet I'm still here and my stomach feels fine, a little hungry, but fine. Camilla, look I already spoke with Mirabelle and trust me she feels almost exactly how you feel. She pretty much wants to reconcile too but is unsure how to do it. Uhh, don't tell her I told you though.", Caleb explained as Camilla's expression morphed to genuine surprise, "That's where ICEP Host Damage Control Officer Caleb Bizzell, trademark, comes in. We will all come to terms with last night's uhh...erotic escapades( mental facepalming) and work for peaceful coexistence and all that good shit.", Caleb finished hands on hips, chest puffed, all with the shit-eatingest grin he could must.Camilla deadpaned at first but soon let out disjointed snorting as her face contorted into a smile before bursting into laughter, " ohohoho Dulce Discordia(Sweet darkness), what was dat? Ju seriously couldn't phrase that any better?""Well it...it sounded...cool in my head so. Don't judge me.", Caleb rubbed his arm embarrassed."Ju are enorme( huge) weirdo Señor.", Camilla spoke between chuckles."Fine, yeah, I'm got a problem with that? Cuz I ain't ashamed of being a weirdo.", Caleb stated haughtily. Without him noticing, Camilla was directly in front of him. She wraps him into a warm hug and humming contently. Caleb smiled sheepishly return his own gentle hug."I like dat about ju. It makes me feel so normal by comparison.", Camilla purred happily nuzzling his cheek. Caleb blushed feeling her breasts press harder into his chest and tense up more feeling her tail snake across his back. He looked up to see her with a deep blush and an longing expression. He should stop this before it spirals out of control."Ahem, Camilla, you're getting a little too happy now", He audibly cleared his throat and casually pulling away. Subsequently, this snapped Camilla back to attention as she realized what she was doing and blushed in embarassment releasing him."L-lo siento Señor, I got a bit carried away!", Camilla frantically apologized."It's fine, it's fine, it happens and...it's...fine.", Caleb uttered as the two exchanged awkward glances at each other. Then came an uncomfortable silence between them. Neither of them sure where to go next after that... experience."Ooook, so...take your time, collect your thoughts and whatnot, then come wait in the living room until we're all together.", Caleb stated breaking the silence while making a break for the door. He turned to her with a nervous but supportive grin, "I'mma go check on Lyca now, I'll see ya in a little bit."...Camilla weakly grinned and nodded watching him leave. As soon as the door closed, her expression morphed into a mixture of confusion and disappointment on her face. She took a deep breath and exhaled to still her racing mind and beating heart. She started to pick up her sketches, shuffling them into one neat stack. While doing so, she thought on what Caleb said: 'I do love you as a close friend.'"Is that really enough for me?", Camilla quietly asked herself hugging the stack of drawings to her chest. After a few moments, she decided it would be better to focus on her apology to Señorita Mirabelle and Lyca. She would deal with these feelings later. While putting the stack away, her eyes lingered on the crumbled sketch of her mother. She made a circular motion with her fingers creating a familiar yellow infinity magic seal. Instantly, the paper was covered in a yellow glow and began restoring back to it's former integrity. She sighed gingerly touching the paper with a depressed frown.'Where did ju go? I've been lost without ju, Mama.', Camilla thought wiping a tear from her eye then smiling weakly, 'But...I believe I found a real home now Mama. ...I just wish ju could see it.'...Caleb repeatedly exhaled and inhaled calming himself from that...experience with Camilla. He began slapping the side of his face in an attempt to smack the lewd out of himself. Honestly, he should feel proud for staying loyal to Moon pie. At the same time though, he couldn't help but feel awful for Camilla. He had to do something for her, as a friend of course, to show how much he cares for her.Suddenly, Caleb felt a sudden fatigue. His head felt a bit heavy, his chest was still racing, and his eyes were filling with stress. It looks like the 'conversations' with them took a lot more out of him than he thought. Dealing with a torrent of heavy emotions and repressed issues from two different people, both with very specific needs, in a row proved to be a bit more than he was prepared for. Feelings of dread arose as he turned his attention to Lyca's room. If his short-term memory was correct, Lyca was by far roughest out of them. And it's LYCA. Who KNOWS how she must feel? Or if she'll even be consolable.Well...on the other hand, he did do a pretty good job helping Camilla and Moon pie.He walked over to Lyca door and pressed his ear to her door. The muffled sound of disjointed grunting and deep raspy breathing could be heard; along with Lyca's voice."77...78...*huff* 79...80!...81...", she repeated between breaths. Caleb raised an eyebrow curiously listening. Was she...working out? Granted under normal circumstances it wouldn't be surprising since she always did her workout succession. Heck, he sometimes went on morning runs with her; even though her idea of a 'morning run' is 15 mile jog around town and back! But now...?Realizing he won't get anywhere just staring at her door, Caleb knocked on her door. The sound of her counting stopped replaced by only her fatigued puffing."Um, Lyca? It's Caleb.", he stated in the door."Hahh, oh morning Chief!", Lyca chirped from the other side still catching her breath.Caleb was caught off guard by her timely response but managed to collect himself, "Can...we talk for a minute?""Sure, one sec!", she stated as what sounded like something heavy being dragged along the floor and clothy materials being tossed could be heard. Suddenly, the door swung open and standing there was the She-Wolf herself wearing a camo sports bra with match tight shorts. A blue towel draped on her shoulders which she used to wipe the remaining sweat from her face. Her muscles still glistened with sweat and the heated sent of her workout began wafting out through the open door. She smiled her usual toothy grin looking at Caleb with attention and genuine affection. Instantly, Caleb grew even more concerned."Uhh...can I...come in? It's something we need to discuss first in private.", Caleb inquired warranting a confused head tilt from Lyca."Ok Chief. Heh funny, this is probably the first time you've asked to come inside my den.", Lyca said with an aloof grin before backing up allowing him space to walk in, "come on in."Caleb stepped inside admiring some of her rustic decor and lingering slightly on her workout equipment; some of which look like they've been used very recently. The entire room was permeated with the thick, earthy scent of her workout sweat and heat. He left the door cracked a bit as he slowly adjusted to the...less than comfortable environment and choosing to breath through his mouth. He made a mental note to try and get back into a weight lifting regiment. Lyca went bounding past him before landing on her bed of animal pelts. Despite knowing they were fake, Caleb found it a little creepy that, among the deer, raccoon, and bear, there were also wolf pelts. She adjusted so she lay on her stomach facing Caleb before reaching down to the floor wear a sports drink bottle sat and drank some. She sighed, tail swaying happily, as the cool liquid refreshed her before focusing her attention back to Caleb. The latter felt a little unnerved by how calm she was being."Ok, Lyca, I wanna talk about last night.", He stated abruptly while watching her reaction.Lyca gave him a puzzled look, "Huh? Last night? What about it?"Caleb paused stunned how lightly she was taking it before pressing further, "It was...I mean, do you know what you did last night?"Lyca put a clawed finger to her chin fixing her gaze upwards in thought, "Hmmm, let's see, I ate dinner, then I played that new fighting game you got with Zwei, then I took a bath, umm OH I gnawed on Bain for a while, then I fell asleep.", she listed off, grabbing her stuffed black wolf from underneath a bear skin. It had several bite and claw mark all over it and stuffing fell out when she suddenly hugged it; then she gave him an innocent smile.Caleb, once again, was caught off guard. He motioned over and sat on the bed next to her, "So...you don't remember anything else, like anything important?""I'm...not sure whatcha mean there Chief. I just g-OH!", Lyca suddenly exclaimed making Caleb jump feeling his heart starting to race. A look of realization was plastered on her wide eyed face."W-what?!", Caleb swallowed hard preparing for what was to come."I remember I had this really weird dream last night.", she started as Caleb's eyes darted to and fro in confusion, "I was running through a forest trying to find some prey, when I came across this tough looking guy. But he was also kinda sad, so I stopped to play with him. He kinda looked like you actually. Then we met these five girls deeper in the woods. Two of them were also really sad, but one was really nervous, one was lonely, and one was really bored. But then, we all came together and started laughing and having fun. Then we dog piled up on each other giving big hugs! I liked that dream.", Lyca finished in a blissful tone and toothy grin. Her tail beat against the bedding occasionally knocking against Caleb's side.Caleb opened his mouth to try and say something. He got nothing. As he looked into her childlike amber eyes filled with trust, he couldn't help but grin at her. He decided to not mention anything about the full moon just yet. He'll get her in the living room with the others and they'll all discuss it together. Better for her to not feel alone or like he's centering most of the blame on her. It was mostly his fault for being forgetful anyways."Heh, ok, that's good.", Caleb said rising off the bed to face her. She was still puzzled by his behavior evident by her touching her claw to her chin before repositioning herself so she was now sitting up on her knees."Ummm, is that all you wanted Chief?", Lyca inquired quizzically."No, one more thing, all of us, you, me, Camilla and Moon pie, are meeting right now in the living room to...discuss something really important.", Caleb stated."Important?", She uttered as if testing the word out herself, "What are we talking about?""It's...kind of a long story. But don't worry, just get changed, maybe wash up a little, then come join us.", Caleb assured her before looking at her ripped up stuffed wolf toy, "Hey, I could stitch Bain up for ya. He's prettttyy worn out.""Ok. Thanks, Chief!", Lyca stated happily hugging Bain causing even more stuffing to spill out. She then lifted her armpit and smelled herself. She gave a ponderous look before chuckling, "Hehe, maybe I'll take ya up on that shower idea.""Ah well take y-", Caleb paused tensing up as he realized he just breathed through his nose for the first time since being in her room closest to the scent. The pungent scent of B.O. hit his nostril like a sledgehammer. On a wider spectrum, it wasn't the WORST thing he had smelled, but it was still unpleasant nonetheless. Gathering up his resolve, he spoke in a strained, pitchy voice, "Yeah, ok, you do that. When-your-done-get-dressed-and-come-join-us!", he finished hurrying out of the door then closing it....Lyca raised an eyebrow at Chief's weird behavior. She sniffed her pits again before doing a 'Meh' shrug. She picked up Bain wrapping him in a tight hug. Her gaze then shifted to her bed; a thought occurred making her raise an eyebrow. She woke up wearing what she has on this morning. She could've sworn she slept naked last night. 'Oh well.' , she thought before looking for something to wear....Caleb inhaled as much clean air as he could then emitted a lengthy exhale. "Gawwwly!", he uttered to himself recovering with a couple more breaths. He looked back to Lucy's room before tentatively scratching the back of his head. That was...surprisingly manageable. No shouting or crying, just talking; reasonable, calm talking. Adding on to the fact that it was with Lyca, the most emotionally inclined out of the bunch. That dream she told him about was odd, but at the same time, he feels kinda relieved. He finally caught the short break he really needed. And with that, he's dealt with each of the girls individually. But he knew things weren't quite resolved yet, they each needed to confront each other about last night.Caleb made his way to the living room to get everything prepared. All the while, a small grin began to form on his face. Knowing there was hope he could salvage the peace in his home, he felt a surge of determination.As soon as he stepped into the living room, he was surprised to find the Zyklons were there. Ein was pacing near the front door muttering what sounded like "Phwk reā thả xarị(What do we do?)" repeatedly. Zwei sat near the counter with her head buried in her arms accompanied by faint groaning. Drei sat on the arm of the couch with her knees pulled into her chest reading a book titled 'Cocoons'. She glanced back at her older sisters before turning back slowly shaking her head in disappointment. It was then Caleb's shoulders lowered in realization. He had almost forgotten about the two Zyklons who tried to assault him."Oh, hello Dear", chirped the voice of Mirabelle. He turned to the kitchen to see her stepping around the counter with a fresh pot of coffee and four mugs dangling off her fingers before sitting them on the counter. The Zyklons were immediately turned to him only just noticing his presence. They all immediately tensed up in shame and fear; except Drei who had no reason to be."I, um, decided to make us all some coffee.", Mirabelle said with rosy cheeks and sweet grin. Caleb returned the gesture at his now official girlfriend."Thanks Moon Pie, that's really-", Caleb started.Before he could finish or even blink, Ein was right in front of him bowing her palms together thumbs in-between eyebrows with her palms near her chest. "MR. BIZZELL! WE'RE SO SORRY! SO VERY, VERY, VERY SORRY! It was just disgraceful how we conducted ourselves.", Ein cried out before continuing to bombard him with a stream of apologies. Zwei got up slowly from the counter dragging feet a bit. Her entire disposition radiated embarassment as crossed her arms and refused to make eye contact. Mirabelle was so startled she nearly dropped the batch of coffee. However, instead of shattering into pieces spilling the hot black liquid on the tiles, it simply levitated off the floor surrounded in green aura. Ignoring Ein for now, Mirabelle and Caleb watched as it floated harmlessly to the counter.They looked behind them to see Camilla standing with a magic seal in her open palm which instantly dissipated the second she closed it."Dat was...close?", Camilla spoke with a awkward feel in her voice. Mirabelle tensed up, her eyes flickering between Camilla and any random object."Oh, y-yeah thank...you?", Mirabelle uttered as Camilla flashed a weak smile before frowning in shame. Then it fell silent in the room; metaphorically, Ein was still prattling on but Caleb kinda just tuned her out for the moment.Caleb could just feel the awkwardness between them so he decided to give them a little push. He slid between as their eyes now focused on him."Hey, why don't y'all just go sit down for a bit. I'll just fix up a little morning snack before we really get started. And uh deal with...that real quick", Caleb advised them before pointing to the bowing wind weasel women; one of whom still berating, explaining, and vilifying their behavior.They looked at him then at each other. Both still a little uncomfortable with the situation. After a moment, each of them nodded in agreement. Camilla quickly took at the far end of the couch as Mirabelle passed Caleb glancing at him for a moment as he flashed her a supportive grin. Suddenly, Ein's voice began to fade back in."It's INEXCUSABLE, we are supposed to protect you!", Ein continued as Caleb refocused on them, "Zwei and I are deeply, deeply ashamed of ourselves! Right Zwei?!"Zwei silently looked away puffing out her cheek before, "GAH OW!", she felt Ein deliver a swift but hard jab to her arm."RIGHT?!", Ein snarled while glaring daggers at Zwei held her arm then bowed to Caleb."YES, we're deeply ashamed! I'm so sorry we tried to straddle you-OW!", Zwei exclaimed getting another well-placed jab, "What the hell was that for?!""Can you BE any more uncouth?! Do you realize how much trouble we'll get in if he decided to tell Sterling about this?! WE CAN BE EXPELLED FROM THIS MISSION AND THIS COUNTRY! We'd be lucky if our home branch will take us back to do GRUNT work after this embarassment! Why can't you take ANYTHING seriously?!", Ein ranted."Hey I-", Caleb uttered only to be interrupted by Zwei."Oh, you think I'm not?! I don't want to go back to doing mountains of paperwork and working with boring asshats all day! Besides, this all started because you were soooo happy to have your own room! And you call me childish.", Zwei shot back."Wait a s-", Caleb tried to interject but cut off again."Me?! Childish? You were the one who was so adamant that we used SO much of Drei's full moon blend that we 'built up a tolerance' and were fine without it!", Ein retorted."Yes, SHE'S an idiot for believing that insane logic and you're an idiot for believing in her and her logic. You're basically a flat earther. I've already berated you two.", Drei interjected momentarily silencing the two. They then glared daggers at each other emitting low growls; the fur standing up on their erect tails. Drei turned to him with a knowing expression before nodding to him. He under"Would you two please just shut up and listen already!", Caleb stated firmly at the two women immediately froze in place preparing to be castigated, "Now, two things: first, you two REALLY feel ashamed for what y'all did, y'all can make it up to me. Starting by helping me cook some breakfast. Second, I meant to discuss last night's events among my wards AND you two anyway. That includes your status as my bodyguards.", He finished with slight coldness in his tone and narrowing his eyes at them. The color drained from their faces as they felt humbled by this man who exuded a dominant aura."You, Zwei right?", Caleb stated pointing to Zwei who instantly stood at attention."Y-yes!", she stated."I assume those blades at your hip aren't just for show.", he remarked pointing to the kunai knives on her hips, "Incidentally, there's a knife set by the microwave; how about dicing up some of them red potatoes and carrots. Now.""Right, Ok!", Zwei stated before zooming past him to grab what he requested."Alright, you, tall one, I'm puttin' you on cinnamon roll and hamburger steak duty. Pop the rolls in the oven for 10 and get some thawed out ground beef from the fridge. Get to it.", Caleb stated."B-but what about last-", Ein murmured before she was cut off."Food now, talk after. Or do you want me to inform ICEP how you 'failed on the first day'", he emphasized with his fingers."EEK, no, no I'm on it!", she exclaimed before zooming past him grabbing a metal tray and going to the freezer.Caleb exhaled calming himself before noticing how Camilla and Mirabelle looked back at him with admiring grins, "Alright, Lyca should be out of the shower soon, so I'm gonna start on hashbrowns, eggs, sausage and bacon.", he stated before catching Drei looking at him expectantly. He made a gun hand gesture saying 'I gotcha' with a wink. She gave him a thumbs up then resumed reading....As they watched him go to work on preparing them breakfast, Camilla and Mirabelle immediately found themselves back where they started. An awkward silence, save for the sounds from the kitchen, and feelings of regret between them.Wanting to try and ease the tension, Mirabelle grabbed the tv remote powering it on. On it appeared a movie with two human women holding a state trooper at gun point. Camilla eyes widened interest as the woman, named Louise apparently, fired off rounds in has vehicle. Mirabelle, on the other hand, seemed to be more interested in the woman, called Thelma, holding the trooper from behind with his own gun. Neither of them knee why, but they felt like the could relate to their respective women in the movie. They each exchanged glances with each other; making eye contact a couple times.Finally, the tension reached it's breaking point. Mirabelle closed her eyes, inhaled sharply while gripping the cushions, summoning whatever courage she had before turning to Camilla."MS. SARTANA-I'M-SO-SORRY!" "SEÑORA I BEG YOUR FORGIVENESS", Both of them shouted simultaneously. They each paused for a second giving each other confused looks."W-what? B-but it's my fault. I chose not to say anything to Caleb about the full moon. All because I was being pathetic.", Mirabelle explained much to Camilla disbelief."Desparates(nonsense) Señora, if any was pathetic it was I. I behaved like a selfish, arrogant fool.", Camilla replied much to Mirabelle's shock."You? Why do you feel pathetic?! Y-you're strong, beautiful, and full of life experience...e-espescially with men.", Mirabelle said glancing away with an embarrassed blush."Who told ju of dis so-called experience with men?", Camilla demanded clearly agitated making tense up."I-I overheard the men who were renovating your room talking about how Succubi are known for their experience with men. And they mentioned that you were over a century old so...", Mirabelle stated feeling kinda bad now hearing it out loud."Señora, those men ju heard were likely members of the same vile, ignorant swine. I do not know the kind of warped perspectives other species have towards mi gente(people), but I assure mi experiencia has been nothing short of nightmarish. Most of mi life, I have been abused, hurt, persecuted...I was even raped. I wanted nothing more than to inflict the pain they gave me a hundred fold.", Camilla stated as Mirabelle wore a horrified expression. Suddenly Camilla sadlu turned her gaze downwards, "I am not strong, beautiful, or full of life experience. I'm always afraid, I am ugly inside and out, and I feel that I haven't learned much of anything after all this time.""Ms. Sartana, I... I didn't know I... I'm so sorry I...", Mirabelle uttered feeling foolish for jumping to conclusions, "I was a fool. To think, this whole time we actually shared something in common", she spoke sadly.Camilla looked up at Mirabelle in surprise. Her full attention only on the centaur."I've spent most of my life in constant fear. Always rejected by humans and even other Centaur. Then I come to this country and experience the same scorn and ridicule; making it worse, from those who smiled in my face. Then I meet this man, one of original hosts, who appeared to be everything I wanted...but even that was a lie. He hurt me...and tried to force himself on me...he almost destroyed me.", Mirabelle choked as tears welled up before turning to Camilla, "I didn't know you experienced a far worse hell than me."Camilla hastily got up taking a seat next to her, "No! No, Senora no matter how long, no one as gentle as ju deserves to go through that!""W-well neither did you! You're a kind person! You saved Lyca and my dear!", Mirabelle says her voice warped by her sobs, "I'm sorry how I acted last night. It's my fault. I saw you with my dear Caleb and I just got so angry and jealous and sad and just hated how much of a coward I was!""No, it was my fault! I didn't realize how just felt about Señor. I made ju feel dat way, I'm so sorry!", Camilla cried tears ran down her cheeks."But I just ran, I didn't even try to make my feelings known and I thought he deserved someone as amazing as you. You great at advanced magic, and martial arts, and cooking, and house work, and magical cooking.", Mirabelle continued tears falling to the cushions."Don't sell yourself short, I've never in my years encountered magic as unique as yours. You even nullified one of my most powerful spells. Ju are marvelous! ", Camilla spoke before wrapping Mirabelle in a hug, "I can't believe I wanted to destroy ju! Please forgive me!"Mirabelle wholeheartedly returned the hug, "I do! Of course I do! Can you ever forgive me?""Jes! Ju are more than deserving, Señora Mirabelle", Camilla uttered holding Mirabelle tighter. The latter returned the gesture as the two sobbed into each other's shoulders. Unbeknownst to the pair, Caleb looked over his shoulder with a smile and discreetly wiped a tear from his eye. Drei looked up at the pair with an almost blank expression as she covered up a small grin with her book.Caleb then heard whimpering coming from next to him. He turned to see tears pouring down Ein's face like cartoonish mini waterfalls. He then raised an eyebrow when he saw Zwei wiping away tears as well."*Hic* Zwei are you chopping onions over there? My eyes just won't stop watering.", Ein choked out."No, maybe it's just seeing them put their differences aside to find common ground is an intimation for our borderline dysfunctional relationship.", Zwei uttered between whimpers before turning to Ein, "I'm sorry sis, I really screwed up big.""Yeah, but I screwed up even bigger by gushing my own space and not stopping you in the first place.", Ein cried before stooping down to hug Zwei who returned, "No matter what, I still love you sis.""Same here sis!", Zwei stated happilyCaleb watched them intrigue as he stirred the eggs up. He looked over at the cutting board Zwei was and shot a deadpaned glare. Turns out she was in fact cutting onions, red onions to be precise.Suddenly the timer on the over went off signaling the cinabuns were done, "Hey, don't mean to interrupt but my buns are about to burn!"Ein pulled away wiping her eyes, "Right, got it!", she then put on an ovenmit and took out the tray of freshly baked goods.Caleb got a serving tray and placed the stack of hashbrowns, bacon, and eggs. His eyes widened to see Drei now sitting at the front counter reading."They are...quite the family huh?", Caleb inquired half jokingly as the two other sisters searched the cabinets for the glaze and plates."They're the siblings I neither need nor want, but the ones I deserve. That's good enough me.", she spoke somewhat sweetly. Caleb paused as he thought frowning a bit to himself, 'ones I deserve huh? That's one way of looking at it, I guess.'"And speaking of deserving things...", Drei said interuppting his thoughts."Heh, yeah I know. Here.", Caleb slid Drei her meatlovers omelet as graciously bowed her head slightly as she took the plate."Morning everyone! How's every...body...?", Lyca announced after having come out of the shower before falling silent upon noticing Camilla and Mirabelle hugging and whimpering on the couch, "H-Hey, what's wrong guys?! Why are you crying?!"Camilla and Mirabelle pulled away from each other; looking at Lyca with their eyes with little red circles around them. They turned to each other taking in how lame they looked. Camilla snorted attempting to hold in her chuckles before breaking into laugh. Mirabelle soon joined her in about of hearty laughter.Lyca stared at in confusion before turning to Caleb for answers, "Chief, what's going-""Lyca! Think fast!", Caleb stated tossing Lyca a bacon strip. Which she skillfully caught in her mouth. Her ears twitching and hips swaying with her wagging tail as she savored the porky treat. He then noticed Ein and Zwei had finished glazing the cinabuns. He looked around and saw everyone was there and the food was ready for eatin'. He lingered a bit on Camilla and Mirabelle as their laughter died down enough for them to catch their breath. Caleb was feeling proud they were able to have a breakthrough all on their own. He then turned to the two Zyklons in the kitchen."Fix y'all some plates too. Well, get me one of those hamburgers and two slices of bread THEN fix yourselves somethin' ", Caleb stated warranting surprised glances between each other. They honestly figured he'd just make them cook then just berate them, "What are you guys staring into space for? Hurry up, we're about to get started."Zwei shrugged before loading her plate with cinabuns and bacon. Ein did the same with more...grace.Caleb then fixed two square plates: one with two cinabuns, bacon, Sunnyside up eggs, and hashbrowns and the other two cinabuns, sauteed carrots and hashbrowns."Here we go. Camilla, for you. And this one's for you, Moon pie. ", Caleb handed them their plates from behind to couch."Gracias Señor,", Camilla grinned contently."Thank you, Dear.", Mirabelle spoke with a smile.Caleb quickly fixed a plate with two hamburger steaks, cinabun, and a mini stack of bacon, "Here ya go Lyca."The she wolf eagerly accepted with a toothy smile while the plate and thanking him. She then turn to him with a concerned expression, "Oh, but Chief what was tha5 was all the crying about and the laughing?"Caleb lay his palm on top of her head between her ear lightly petting her. She sighed happily at his touch before he said, "Don't worry, we're about to talk about that in a minute. Take a seat with others right now.""Ok!", Lyca stated before walking past him shoving a while hamburger in her mouth."Here you are sir!", Ein stated from behind startling Caleb a bit. He turned to see her bowing as she presented the hamburger steak, two wheat bread slices and hashbrowns to the side. Admittedly, he felt a bit wrong for doing her like this but it was necessary to rebuilding any trust. Yep, totally necessary. "Thank you, Ein.", he said before taking a bit of his hamburger. He savored the robust taste and surprisingly smooth texture."Hey, these burgers are great, Ein. What seasoning is this?", Caleb inquired taking another bite. She raised an eyebrow puzzled by his sudden nonchalant behavior."I-I just used some coriander and a pinch of black pepper from your spice rack", She explained."Well this is one of the best hamburgers I've had in a while. You really know your blends.", Caleb complimented.She sighed in exasperation, " Mr. Bizzell, I'm sorry but I need to know what is the purpose of this? You could just tell your coordinator what happened and be done with us. Why are dragging it out by having us all eat together?"Caleb finished his burger sitting the plate on the counter then facing her, "Tell me, would you like to deal with the aftermath of tramatic event in the morning on an empty stomach too? And on top of that, dealing with it seemingly on your own? Right now, everyone's getting settled in, food in their bellies, and time to decompress in the presences of company they can relate to. See?"Ein followed his gesture toward the group. Mirabelle and Camilla were now invested in the movie, Lyca and Zwei were happily talking with each other. She was actually surprised how calm everyone was acting."If we're all gonna talk this like adults, everyone needs to be full and relaxed.", Caleb explained."D-does that mean you're not-", Run was about to say but he quickly interrupted."Oh I am, I'm quite indignant about the whole thing. Especially with you and your sister.", he said crossing his arms. Ein gulped sinking her shoulders in fear."So why don't you grab a cinnamon roll for that face hole while I get things started.", he said moving around the couch standing in front of all the girls. Ein honestly couldn't believe he put this much forethought in how he was going to approach them. Suddenly a cinnamon roll appeared in her face snapping her out of her thoughts. It was Drei holding said cinnamon roll while sitting on counter."It IS a cheat day.", Drei sarcastically stated.Ein slumped in defeat taking the roll jamming it in her mouth.Caleb moved around the coffee table sitting next to Mirabelle and gently touching her arm to get her attention, "Hey Moon pie, you mind turning to tv off for a bit? Don't worry, I'll play the movie from the beginning for you guys on Netflix later." She kindly obliged before leaning in to inform Camilla.Moved again standing on the other side of coffee and in front of the tv. As it powered off, all the girls individually focused their attention on him. Caleb inhaled and exhaled calming himself before starting, "Alright girls, time for little heart to heart. Now, in case some of you don't remember, last night was a full moon."The girls each wore varying expressions ranging from shameful embarassment to regular embarassment. Lyca, however, seemed genuinely shocked and a little afraid she may have something."So because of the full moon, most of you were acting, and I say this with love, totally batshit crazy. Some even crazier than others. But I'm not here to scold anyone( much), I want to talk about moving past this together. We are a family and there should be trust between all of us. So I'm go around the room, describing what each girl did. Let's just lay all the embarassment on the table. Once everyone's embarrassed no one will be. I know it sounds crazy, but it just works. ", Caleb stated warranting uncertain looks from Lyca, Ein, and Zwei. Camilla and Mirabelle were a bit more comfortable though. They felt at ease knowing he was trying his best for them. It truly warmed their hearts."Alright, I'm gonna start with two girls who were equally a bit of a handful. Moon pie and Camilla.", Caleb stated.The two girls in question became stiff as stone; eyes widened like dinner plates. 'Oh no", they both thought collectively.Heyyyy Fam, what's up? Ok, I'm sorry for ghosting you guys the last couple months but you gotta understand there has been so much on my plate. First, of course, I had finals and one of my course was comprehensive. Not to mention, my professor was a huge cucklorde king of cucks. But, good news I manage to pass all my finals. Still an A-B student!Second, there was my brother's wedding where yours truly was a groomsman. Lovely wedding, beautiful bride, ugly groom (jk bro 😁), and...ok food.Third, Mothers day. The day this chapter was supposed to be uploaded! But, I was cooking a borderline lovely Italian theme dinner for her which was DELICIOUS! Hope you all showed your moms how much they mean to you. No matter how small the token, hell just being there with them, that's the best gift you could give.Alright now that you're caught up on my life, I have a few announcements. Since I have a lot more freetime this Summer, I'll be writing for this story more frequently. Which means more of Drei! Yay!Also, I recently began a new story based on the adventures Caleb and Mirabelle have in the dreamscape. It's called DreamMasterz. Don't be confused, there will still be DreamMasterz sequences in the main story but they'll mostly serve to drive the plot. The new story will be purely for entertainment; only occasionally making references to the main story. To make things more interesting, I'll have polls for the scenarios they could be a part of ranging from a variety of fandoms ( Dragon ball, Jojo bizarre adventure, Avengers, ect.).Ok, that's all for now. See ya guys soon. Peace Fam!
  
    Chapter Text
    Chapter 16: ProgressionWhat's up Fam? Well here we are again with another chapter. I hope you all are enjoying the Summer, and if you're not, don't worry, Fall will be here before ya know it. Before we get started, there's something kinda random I've been meaning to put out there; concerning the characters. Specifically, their voices.I've always imagined Caleb looking and sounding a bit like Jordan Peele, only slightly less chubby. Mirabelle, pretty much sounds like any girl from the U.K. Lyca sounds like Louise Belcher from Bob's Burgers; in my mind at least. Camilla, and this one's my favorite, sounds like Zoe Saldana's Gamora from GOTG but with thicker Hispanic accent( so basically Zoe Saldana). Agent Sterling...think of Robert Downey Jr with a Southern accent. Ein sounds like english dub Nami from One Piece. Zwei is Megumin from Konosuba(english dub). Drei is Saki from Fruits Baskets(also english dub). Have fun with that information. Now to resume the story.Roughly an hour passed in the Bizzell household. And by God, it was the most awkwardly uncomfortable hour Caleb and the girls have had to endure.Caleb went over everything that each of them did the previous night. Well...he decided to omit a few details to save the girls some modesty. He wanted to help them after all, not degrade them. Then near the end, Drei took over explaining the gist what happened after they were all out cold thanks to the medicine.They reacted...exactly like he expected.****Earlier****Caleb sat in a chair he pulled from the kitchen; leaning with his elbows to his knees and interlocked fingers covering his mouth pensively. He looked around at the girls who were intentionally avoiding eye contact with him and each other.Mirabelle was covering her beet-red face in embarassment. Camilla focused her attention away from them out of shame with her tail wrapped around her waist tightly. Lyca was shocked when he told her what she did. She appeared to be taking the revelation quite harshly. She sat with her knees to her chest, tail lock between her legs, and ears pointed downwards while hiding her bright red flustered face; low canine whimpers could be heard. Right next to her, Zwei sat on the arm of couch her back turned to everyone and stuffing her face with a plate of bacon and sausage. Her face was rosy pink. Ein was covering her face with a pillow and groaning lowly to herself while Drei, who was still reading, gently pat her thigh in a 'there-there' fashion.Caleb softly sighed to himself and thought, 'Alright. Now that we've put all the embarrassing shit out there, now it's time to start moving past this.'He rose up from his chair with a few of them noticing but avoiding eye contact. He audibly cleared his throat as they prepared for what he was about to say."Come on now guys, what's with the long faces? I already said I'm not mad anymore, in fact, I find this experience rather educational.", Caleb started as they listened to him intently as he continued, "First, I learned that two inches of carbon steel don't mean shit to a love crazed demon. Second, I learned I need to invest in two things: a big metal chastity belt like the Romans used and wet wipes. Lots and lots and lots of wet wipes."He finished with a toothy grin looking around at them; it beginning to fade when he got no immediate response and worried if he's just making them feel worse. That is, until he heard the sound of disjointed muffled snorts and giggles. Caleb and the rest turned a surprised gaze at Mirabelle who cupped her mouth attempting to hold in her chuckles with her eyes clothes."Hehe, you may be right Dear. Those boxers can only offer so much protection.", Mirabelle chucklesCaleb smirked at her before continuing, "I know right? Especially when a certain lovely little Nightmare has a bit of naughty side. Gotta say I don't dislike it though."Mirabelle snorted again in a more hearty chuckle, "hahaha oh blimey, my host is a cheeky pervert. What am I going to do?", she says in mock distress. They laughed at one another as the rest stared at them in confusion. Lyca stared at them with her ears perked up and feeling the corners of her mouth twitch before forming a small grin. A couple of light giggles escaped her lips. Caleb noticed this and grinned at her."Oh oh, Lyca, sweetheart, I gotta ask.", Caleb inquired as the she wolf went quiet again; her ears pointing back down."Y-yes Chief?", She utters cautiously."How do your pants survive?"Lyca was caught off guard only tilting her head quizzically, "W-Wha?""With strong thighs like those, I'm amazed the fabrics don't shred to pieces every time you squat. I couldn't even WALK after being squeezed by those literal leg prisons! Do you just punish your thigh master everyday?!", Caleb chuckled.The She-wolf became more relaxed and even started to laugh with him.Lyca stood up hands on her hips, "Ha, yep, these are my pride and joy. How else am I supposed to keep them in shape?", she says proudly striking poses showing her legs off, "Besides, it says a lot that you were able to survive my prison in the first place Chief."Caleb rubbed his head sheepishly."You were quite the rambunctious one Lyca, like a cute little puppy wanting to play.", Mirabelle giggled.Lyca blushed a little, "Heyyyy, I-I'm not cute. I ain't some puny lap dog. I'm a proud big bad wolf, baby!""Well you've certainly got the 'pride' and the 'wolf' parts down. I prefer you NOT all big and bad though.", Mirabelle quipped."Mrrgrgrr, fine I'll take it. But ya gotta admit Mira, from Chief's description, you were real scary looking. ", Lyca replied giving Mirabelle a sly smirk. Mirabelle cheeks flushed pink giggling bashfully.Camilla and the Zyklons continued eyeballing them trying to figure out what was happening. Camilla actually found it amusing but kept to herself uncertain she had any right to join in with them."Nooooo Lyca, that award definitely goes to Camilla over here.", Caleb stated gesturing to said demoness who immediately tensed up facing him upon hearing her name called out."Que?!", She utters in Spanish."Oh don't play dumb Ms. 'Return mi lover or face destruction' ", Caleb says in a cheesy Hispanic accent, "Nah, but for real, you ma'am could make the demon from The Exorcist be like, 'Oh Hell no, fuck this shit!' "Caleb, Mirabelle, and Lyca each burst out laughing as Camilla gazed at them ponderously before feeling the corners of her mouth curl upwards and a light giggle starting to grow within her."Ohoho, well...but your one to talk Señor. 'I SAID STOOOOPPPP!' ", Camilla says making her voice deeper and manlier trying to mimic him."Ha, he sounded like a screaming goat!", Mirabelle quipped."He did! Diablos mio, and it was so shrill. I swear he turned into a dying cat near the end ahahahaha!", Camilla replied as she and Mirabelle burst into laughter with Lyca joining in.Caleb jokingly rolled his eyes as their cackles continued, " Yeah, yeah ok, keep it coming, that's it. Yeah see...see this is perfect. Uh huh.""Oh, but Camilla, how DID you do that voice?", Mirabelle inquired.Camilla wore a puzzled expression, "M-mi voz?""Hey yeah, that weird distorted demon voice.", Caleb pointed out."Oh!", Camilla said before concentrating, "Ju mean like this?"Lyca held her cheeks in amazement with starry eyes, "Holy Bear balls! That's so freakin cool!""Hehehehehe gracias, but it's a trait quite common among all devils as a kind of...deterrent.", Camilla spoke before clearing her throat, "It's an effective way to intimidate would be attackers.""Well it sho'nough worked last night. That and those bright red evil eyes, I was almost too scared to move. Remind me to always stay on your good side.", Caleb chuckled, "But you're also pretty amazing Camilla."Camilla's cheeks flushed as a smile grew on her face, "Oh, um, Gracias, Señor Caleb.""Oooh, I wanna learn how to do that! Can you teach me?", Lyca appears in front of Camilla tail wagging excitedly."Lyca, she just said it's a trait among her species. I'm not sure werewolve can just learn how to do it.", Mirabelle said."Awww, come on Mira, never know what you can do until you get up high as you can go.", Lyca replies as Caleb raised an eyebrow at her choice of words."That's it, no more 80s music for you!", Caleb stated.As Caleb and his wards continued their banter, Ein and Zwei gave each other 'I don't know' shrugs."What is happening right now?", Ein questioned as the group burst into another round of laughter. Zwei just observed them, strangely feeling more at ease."Progress.", Drei uttered looking up from her book as her sisters turned their attention to her, "They're making progress."******Now******Things pretty much went like that up until Caleb gotten to roasting Ein and Zwei. The two were reluctant at first, but gradually loosened up enough to join in on the laughter. By the time noon rolled around, much of the laughter had died down and most of the food had been eaten. The previously tense atmosphere in the house was now replaced with lively, carefree chitchat among the girls.Caleb felt like he could finally breath easy now. As he looked around at his houseguests and bodyguards, he realized it was the first time in a while this house he's lived in for the last few years has felt like...a home.His gaze lingered on Mirabelle as something important came to mind. He casually maneuvered towards her and knelt down to whisper in her ear. Camilla, having noticed, was a bit confused by Mirabelle stunned expression from whatever he told her. Mirabelle appeared to ruminate for moment before nodding to him with rosy cheeks and small grin."*clears throat* Hey. Hey everybody! I-We actually have an announcement.", Caleb stated as the other girls stopped what they were doing to focus on the pair. He could sense Mirabelle becoming nervous and gently squeezed her shoulder supportively, "Well, the short version is that Moon pie and I have made a big step in our relationship. Ain't that right baby?"Mirabelle giggles leaning her head to his arm, "Hehe, that's right Dear."The other girls became wide eyed in surprise and anticipation."W-whoa, did... are you guys engaged or something?!", Zwei exclaimed as the others became even more shocked.Caleb felt his face heat up and a lump in his throat for a second. Mirabelle's skin turned beet-red with stunned look as steam wafted from her head."No, no no no noooo, we're not at that point! We just made things official! We're now boyfriend and girlfriend! That's what I meant!", Caleb explained before turning to Mirabelle, "Moon pie, please help me ou-wha!?"He utters noticing Mirabelle's beet red face, spiraling eyes, and her slightly puffed out cheeks with steam emanating from her body. She gasps sending another puff of steam out of her mouth as she caught her breath."Moon pie?!""Eh?! S-sorry Dear! I-I stopped breathing for second there.", She apologizes touching her fingers together shyly, "and I might've drifted off somewhere else."Caleb blinked at her answer thinking, 'Why is she so damn cute?'The other girls seemed to be processing the news individually. Lyca, and Camilla especially, seemed to be pondering it the most with equal parts surprised, intrigued, and... slightly hurt expressions.Lyca bounded over towards the couple with a big smile showing her trademark white canines and supportively touching their shoulders."That's awesome guys. I'm so happy for both of you! Be honest, it's about time. I was starting to think you guys would stay in the friend zone forever.", Lyca stated happily despite her tail remaining still the whole time."Hehe, yeah, thanks Lyca.", Caleb smiles back before petting her head gingerly scratching her ears to which she sweetly chuckled her tail now wagging energetically. Mirabelle grinned at Lyca for being so supportive of them.Ein's jaw hung open uttering gibberish trying to find the right words."Gotta admit, they do look pretty good together. Like sticky rice and mango or pretzels and chocolate.", Zwei chimed in."Or Cosby and the number '13375' ", Drei added.As they chatted, behind them, Camilla sat with her hands to her lap smiling weakly with clear hints of disappointment and slight jealousy. Don't get her wrong, she WAS happy for them...but..."EXCUSE ME!", Ein shouted as everyone fell silent observing her with questioning glares, "Aren't all of you overlooking the fact that this country STILL prohibits human/liminal relationships?! You forget my sisters and I work for ICEP Mr. Bizzell. We're obligated to report something like this."She finished as Lyca, Camilla, and Zwei gave her displeased looks. Mirabelle became nervous from the sudden realization. As Ein looked around at everyone, a sense of unease crept down her spine. Nevertheless, she knew what she said is right and didn't waver. She looks down at Drei who shook her head in a 'you done fucked up' fashion."Annnd that's another thing I'd like to go ahead and address.", Caleb stated calmly, "I'm perfectly aware of the laws humans and liminals have to uphold AND the punishments for failure to do so. That part Sterling's pretty much hammered in like damn Commandment.""But here's the thing. This girl right here, I love her. I fell IN love with her.", Caleb states interlocking his fingers with his girlfriend's and smiling at her warmly as she returned it with shimmering purple eyes full of adoration"Well, Mr. Bizzell that's wonderful bu-", Ein starts but was cut off."Uh-uh, I'm not done! That's why I'd like to make a deal with you and your sisters.", He says as each of the Zyklons ears stood erect and focused on him curiously. Even Camilla, Lyca, and Mirabelle were curious what he was imposing, "In exchange for keeping our secret, I won't tell Sterling about last night. As a little bonus, whenever you guys are running low on food, I'll cook y'all something to eat. Deal?""Deal.", Zwei and Drei stated simultaneously much to Ein's shock and frustration."Wha?! Are you serious? You do realize what he's proposing amounts to blackmail and bribery!", Ein affirmed."And what you two did could amount to sexual assault and negligence.", Drei commented making Ein hang her mouth agape in realization and shock."Yeah sis, it's not like we're free from any accountability here. I know ya want us to do uphold our pride as agents but what our bosses don't know won't hurt them, but mostly us. Besides, come on, FREE food whenever we want! Do you not remember our insane rent back in our old one bedroom apartment? How we could barely keep groceries? We ate freakin cup noodles for dinner almost every night!", Zwei asserted."I envy the starving children in Africa, for they were never subjected to such cruelty.", Drei added.Ein wanted to report but couldn't deny there was plenty of truth to what they say. She had plenty of reservations against all of this; she just wanted to perform her duty well. She never intended to let things get this out of control. She never does. "I... I know, but what will happen when they're caught huh? Even if we go along with this, we'll still get some of the blame. Maybe even have our status revoked ", she spoke hanging her head sullenly.Caleb stepped up to her getting "Ein, ma'am, I understand you're just doing your job and I respect you for your dedication. You don't have to worry about having your names dragged through the mud. I'll take full responsibility for if we're ever caught. Notice I said 'IF'.", He then turns to Mirabelle, "We'll be very, very careful won't we Moon pie?""Oh, um, yes Dear. We certainly will.", Mirabelle spoke with an assured grin."See? Besides, there's no way I'm going anywhere. Moon pie may be my girlfriend, but I care for all my homestays greatly and I won't let anything happen to any of them.", Caleb finished as Lyca and Camilla blushed happily. He then extends a hands to her, "I'll ask again, do we have a deal?"Ein was floored by his commitment and willingness to take the blame for them. After mulling it over for a moment, she relented with a plaintive sigh. Once again she had to the adult in the situation.She reached up grasped his hand with a surprising amount of strength Caleb wasn't ready for, "Yes...I-We accept. You better know what you're doing.", she uttered begrudgingly."I don't. Doesn't mean I'm not going to be careful though.", Caleb said sheepishly rubbing the pain out of his hand, "Plus, I'm pretty good at keeping secrets.""Fine, I suppose that's good enough.", Ein uttered spiritlessly."Don't worry, you guys can be all lovey-dovey and we'll look the other way; for a number of reasons actually.", Zwei stated."At least he didn't go with the whole 'houseguests with benefits' thing we've seen before.", Drei added, "Plus, food that's ACTUALLY food, so my lips are sealed.""I won't say anything either Chief. Nobody's going to separate any of us! We're a family! Right Camilla?", Lyca finished looking at Camilla who's eyes widened before standing up beside Lyca facing Caleb"Jes, of course. That's right. We are...a familia.", she says as if testing the word out, "And on my pride as a being of discord, I won't let tell any other soul about ju and...Senorita Mirabelle"Caleb could sense the unease in her voice. He then stepped away from Mirabelle towards them and lay a firm hand on each of their shoulders. They each looked at him with anticipation."Thank you. Both of you are wonderful, I'm so grateful to have you both with us.", Caleb smiles at them looking up at Camilla then down to Lyca. Lyca's amber eyes lit up with cheerful vigor and smile happily before hugging and nuzzling his arm affectionately wagging her tail. Camilla hesitated a bit before smiling back with admiration in her eyes. Mirabelle watched the whole scene glad that both of them supported her new love life with her Dear. At the same time, she felt something was a bit off and even momentarily felt a tinge of...jealousy?*knock knock knock*Suddenly, knocking was heard at the front door. He the girls turned their attention to it wondering who it could be."Huh, wonder who this is now. Hang on I'll g-", Caleb said maneuvering past everyone to answer the door only Ein to stop him."Wait! Let me answer it. It could be assassin from the Malone family posing as a mail carrier to kill you with a pistol disguised in a postage box.", Ein said before rushing to the door standing in front of it with her long scythe-like blades extending outwards."That's...oddly specific. You really think they'd just send someone in broad daylight? It could be an actual mail man.", Caleb stated a bit worried but still trying to be reasonable.Zwei got up drawing her blades, "True, but we're not taking the chance. Organizations like these can send anyone at any time to take you out.", she then gets into a lung position in front of Caleb ready to strike at any moments.Caleb felt a pair of arms pull him close and saw it was Mirabelle with a scared but determined look as she prepared to do...something, anything to protect him. He turned to see Camilla with a black magic seal in her open palm and Lyca brandishing her claws while facing the door."Guys come on, let's just see who's at the door before we-""Whoa! Uh, mornin' to ya ma'am, is Caleb wake y-OH!", came the familiar voice of Caleb's supervisor, Rodney, yelping in fear. He was holding a carry pack with his MacBook pro and two roll up slots attached."I'll be asking the questions sir! State your name and purpose for being here. I would require a form of identification.", Ein stated in a professional yet threatening tone while having her scythe brandished ready to strike if he made any desperate moves."Ma'am what do you mean?! You one of Caleb's houseguests or something? I just wanted to drop off some specs for him to go over!", Rodney stated holding up the carrying pack a bit fearful of the imposing woman. Suddenly a small gust of wind blew from the house almost knocking him down. He was surprised to see standing before him what appeared to be a girl in her mid-teens,with a very similar appearance to the taller woman, brandishing twin blades on her crossed arms at him."You heard the lady! Identification. Take it out or I'll just slice it out.", Zwei ordered.Caleb broke free from Mirabelle grip to put a stop to this nonsense, "Alright, that's enough you two! He IS my supervisor, we've worked together the last three years.""How are you sure he's not a shape-shifter hired by the Malones?!", Ein inquired not convinced."Lyca, you Rodney's scent right? You getting anything?", he asked the She-wolf."Hmm, *sniff sniff sniff* Hey, he does smell like him, so it had to be him.", Lyca responded."Yes, BUT, shape-shifters are known to even replicate physical attributes of other people; including, body texture, speech impediments, and even natural body odors.", Ein explained."Alright, let me try something else then", Caleb deadpaned at Ein before looking to Rodney who had an expressions pleading him to call them off, "Three, six, nine. Damn she fine. Move it to me sock it to me one more time", he started as Rodney switch was flipped"Get low. Get low, get low, get low, get low,", Caleb continued as Rodney quickly, with a ton of enthusiasm, joined in, "to the windowwwww, to the wall. Til the sweat roll down my balls. All these bitches crawl."The girls...were utterly baffled by what was happening right now. Ein and Zwei gave each other confused glances."Ok, let him go it's really him. Only HE is corny enough to sing old ass shit with that much heart.", Caleb explained. Each of the girls seemed to still comprehending his bizarre method of identifying an imposter. Ein and Zwei retracted their blades allowing him to step inside."Gahhh-lee! Really stepping up security around here.", Rodney stated rubbing his neck looking back at the two scythe wielding girls, "You got TWO more girls Caleb?""Sorry about that, they're my new bodyguards. The tall one is Ein Zyklon, the one next to her is her sister Zwei, and the one on the couch is her other sister Drei", Caleb introduces them respectively."Hello. I greatly apologize for the inconvenience." "Hey there, same to a lesser extent" " I also exist.", They each greeted respectively."Bodyguards?", Rodney leans in and whispers Caleb, "is...this bout that whole uhh...thing with them gangsters?""Yeah, and I'd like ya to keep it kinda hush hush. Nobody else can know. I don't need to cause some kind of panic at work.", Caleb requested in a serious tone. Rodney nodded agreeing to keep quiet about it"Hiya, Rod!", Lyca bounds towards them hold her fist out."Hey, Wolfy, been a while! What you been up to?", Rodney replies bumping fists with her."Nothin' much, workin out, Red Dead, you know, just doing me.", Lyca answered nonchalantly. Rodney chuckles before noticing Mirabelle."And how have you been, Ms. Marequine?"Mirabelle calms herself, "Fine, t-thank you for asking sir.""That's good to h-", Rodney stopped, eyes widening as soon as he saw Camilla, the rather imposing looking devil, staring at him arms crossed and a look of discontent. He gulped feeling a chill go down his spine."Uhhhh, hi...you...must be new here too?", Rodney nervously replied only for Camilla to scoff at him turning away.Caleb pulled him to the side, "Yes, she's my actual new houseguest-Ms. Camilla Sartana. Don't take it personally, she's just not very open towards strangers.""N-no, uhh, it's fine, f-for real. Anyway, she just... surprised me a bit.", He says turning to Camilla, "It's nice to meet you ma'am."Camilla begrudgingly turned to him narrowing her red eyes at him, "Hola", she utters a bit forced and full of distaste. Caleb sighed to himself before deciding to end this conversation."So, you say you have some designs for me to look on over?", Caleb inquires."Sure do! It's a bit confidential so I came over to drop it off to you personally. That blade design you presented was just what the development boys were looking for and wanted us to look over this new little project. By 'us', I of course, mean you. ", He says opening his case handing Caleb a flash drive and two slender metal cylinder containers."Wow, thanks. Your unwavering trust in me warms my heart.", Caleb replied half sarcastically."Aww, you're welcome bud. Ok, I've gotta run, as usual verify the parameters and send me the results.", Rodney says as makes for the door with Caleb opening it for him. When he was outside he suddenly turned to Caleb gesturing him to come out too. Caleb stepped out closing the door."Hey...so...it's true. You do have...a devil living with you now.", Rodney said coming to terms with it."Well, yeah, is that a problem?", Caleb inquired crossing his arms."A little man. Now I'm a very devout member of my church but even I don't have anything against her kind. I was just caught off guard, is all. But you know, plenty of folks down South don't like her people. I just wanna make sure you play it safe and watch out for her and yourself.", Rodney said sound genuinely concerned."I will. Believe me, I know how people feel about Camilla's race but I took her in my home because I wanted to help her. I'll be damned if I'm going to be scared into regretting that decision.", Caleb stated."Alright, good on ya man. Just be careful.", He said preparing to leaving for his car that was parked on the curb before stopping in place, "Oh yeah, somethin' else I wanted to ask you. You know there was a full moon last night? Did you have any trouble out of your girls?""...Nope. Gave'em some pills and they all slept like babies.", Caleb lied as convincingly as he could, "What about you? How was your Scylla girl, what's her name again?"Rodney eyes widened for a split second, "...Good. She was...good. It's Sally by the way, she slept well."There was an awkward silence for a moment between the two men."Well, I'll be seeing you, Cal.", Rodney said as he left. Caleb went back inside to be met by the girls, particularly Mirabelle."Is everything alright Dear?", Mirabelle inquired concerned for him.Caleb gently cupped her head massaging her ear to ease her, "It's fine Moon pie, just discussing a few private details on the project.""Señor, does that man come here frequently?", Camilla asked with clear discontent."Not frequently, but sometimes he does to check on my progress on projects.", Caleb noticed her fall silent as if contemplative, "He's a nice guy Camilla. Don't worry he grows on you.""Yeah, he's a pretty good guy. I could tell the first time I met him.", Lyca added."That was not the look given by someone worth trusting. I will tolerate his presence but I will not engage him any further.", Camilla responded coldly clearly not convinced. Caleb sighed realizing he'd have to get her out of that habit soon."Well at least I CAN say you didn't threaten him on first introduction.", Caleb spoke a bit agitated rolling his eyes landing on the Zyklons, Ein and Zwei."Wha? I was just being cautious, sir! We still don't know what the enemy is fully capable of! It's best to observe anyone with a little bit of scrutiny.", Ein explains before Zwei jumps in."That's right. You got lucky this time but who knows when an enemy could strike.""You guys sure are good at NOT making someone even more paranoid.", Caleb stated facetiously."That's just what our old crisis counselor trainer said.", Drei added as her sisters both made shushing gestures.Ignoring that, Caleb repositioned the containers in hand turning heading towards the hall way, "Whatever. Anyway I'm going to be in my office for a few hours.""Aww, but I was going to ask if we could go for run in the park.", Lyca whined in disappointment."Sorry, this looks pretty important and I want to knock it out as soon as I can. We could go later though.", Caleb says trying to comfort her. She slumps her shoulders with ears pointed down looking like a scolded puppy."I could go with her. Since I'm an ICEP agent, I can act as her chaperone. Plus, I'm sure I can keep up with her better than you could.", Zwei volunteered much to Ein's confusion and suspicion."Zwei, what are you-""Sounds good to me. Lyca, is that ok with you?", Caleb inquired the She-wolf in question."Hey wait a min-""Heck yeah! Let's go right now Zwei.", Lyca happily stated before grabbing Zwei by the hand pulling her towards the door. All while Ein became visibly agitated."Hey, hey, easy. I still need fully functional arms you know.", Zwei said feeling soreness grow in her joint."Both of you stop rig-""Make sure to get her back before I start dinner. I'm counting on ya.", Caleb interrupted as Zwei and Lyca turned to him."Got it Chief." "No problem, Boss. I haven't failed an escort mission yet.", they said respectively before leaving out."Hey! You're seriously just going to let her take one of your homestays out by herself?! What if something happens?", Ein demanded."It's fine.", Caleb said sternly, "I could tell from that look in her eyes. She's not going to let anything happen to her. I decided to trust her because of that. But if you feel like something could happen, you're welcome to tag along.""I...but...but I can't leave Drei alone either to-"Caleb stopped her, "I think your sister has proven to me she is more than capable of holding down the fort on her own, don't you think?""The recognition I deserve but don't need.", Drei commented, "I will watch over them just make sure to arm the system next door. Also, don't go in my room. It's booby-trapped.""O-ok, fair enough I suppose. Alright, I'll be back soon Drei.", Ein stated leaving as the door closed behind her."I'd call that jinxing herself but that would imply she had any luck to begin with.", Drei said before returning to reading her book.Caleb shook his head before turning to Camilla and Mirabelle."So what you guys going to do?", he asked.Camilla seemed to ponder that question for a second before Mirabelle gave her answer."I was hoping we could finish that movie we saw earlier. I-if that's fine by you Ms. Sartana.", Mirabelle asked."Oh, Si Señorita. Dat would be nice. I don't really get to watch many of these picture shows humans like so much, but I found those two women enjoyable.", Camilla spoke contentedly grinning at Mirabelle.Caleb nodded in satisfaction, "Alright, you guys enjoy yourselves. Heads up, that movie might have have a few...intense scenes.""Ok, thank you love.", Mirabelle chimed as he disappeared into the hallway"Err, so this um...Net Flicks? How does it work exactly? I don't see any thing that looks like a net.", Camilla inquired confused by the many titles on the screen and curious testing the function of each button on the remote.Mirabelle went to her side "Oh, well here let me show you. It's quite simple really..."...Caleb sat down leaning back in the chair at his desk closing his eyes in quiet contemplation. This morning had really taken a lot out of him, emotionally and spiritually. Honestly, he couldn't believe how lucky he was things managed go as well as they did. At least they managed to salvage their relationships with each other. Maybe with more time they could truly move on...as a family.Caleb straightened up in his chair at that thought. He slowly opened a droor to his right and stared down at a large leather bound book visibly worn a bit from age. He frowned at the only memento of what he thought family truly meant. Realizing he's starting to slip back into toxic thoughts he slammed the droor shut deciding to focus back on anything else.He plugs the flashdrive Rodney gave him and immediately opened up the only document folder on it. Instantly, the screen displayed 3D models and simulations in AutoCAD. He unrolled both of the large schematics. One being of the turbine blades their currently working on, the other being the outer structure of the turbine itself and it's dimensional parameters."Hmm, there's a few variables left unsolved.", Caleb uttered thinking out loud, "Thermal expansion needs to be constrained to provide optimal performance. Oof this is gonna be a while."Caleb takes a can of diet Dr. Pepper he grabbed from the kitchen and pops the cap before enjoying the burning sensation and crisp taste. He then grabs some ear buds plugging them in his laptop and opened his playlist, "Gonna need something thinkin' music."He clicks the play button as a base-line beat start in his ear, 'Im a fuckin' walkin' paradox. No I'm not. Threesome with a fuckin' triceratops, Reptar...', Caleb nodded to the beat as he got to work....hours later...Caleb finished his research with only a minor headache and sent Rodney the results. Lyca and Zwei returned from the park seemingly without problems. That is until he heard Ein scolding her sister for something as her sister ignored and downplayed it before resuming her conversation with Lyca. Ein appeared frustrated before relenting. Caleb decided to just let that situation be but also found it nice that Lyca and Zwei were bonding well.Speaking of bonding, Camilla and Mirabelle finished watching 'Thelma and Lousie' from beginning to end for the first time. They were...a bit surprised by it. Turns out it was very different from what either of them expected but they loved it nonetheless. They each exchanged thoughts on their some of their favorite parts and how they really understood and enjoyed the relationship of main characters. Camilla even comforted Mirabelle as she wept over the ending scene. Caleb loved seeing the two of them finally getting along.The rest of the day went by relatively normal or at least what passes for normal nowadays. The only thing even close to conflict they had was when Zwei and Lyca wanted to use the tv to play some games but Camilla and Mirabelle wanted to watch another movie. Caleb mediated that by just letting them use his second PS4 on the Zyklons tv next door. Drei joined them to make sure they didn't have too much fun. He then decided to watch a movie with Camilla and Mirabelle...with Ein joining them. He decided on a Southern classic, 'Forrest Gump', which got quite a few laughs out of each of them.During the movie, Mirabelle cuddled up next to him sweetly nuzzling his shoulder. At the same time, Caleb noticed Camilla would have a somber almost longing look as she watched them; only to turn her attention back to the movie whenever he glanced at her. He needed to do something to help her soon. About three-fifths of the way through the movie, Caleb decided to start on dinner. Camilla offered to help but he politely declined much to her slight disappointment.Dinner went off without a hitch. Of course, because they still haven't been grocery shopping, the Zyklons joined them. Caleb decided to go with a classic Alabama dish tonight;. chicken fried steak and pork strips with spicy black eyed peas, mashed potatoes and gravy, and a Ceasar salad(for Mirabelle). He noticed it was quite noisy at the dinner table tonight. Everyone conversing with each other on different topics, utensils scraping the plates; a stark contrast from the quiet, lifeless nights he ate alone. He kinda liked it....much later...'Don't stop, believin', hold on to that freedom yeeeahhh', Caleb hummed as put away the dishes to dry and put a few things in soapy water to soak over night.Night time somehow came much quicker today than normal. Everyone had eaten their fill and taken their baths. Ein and her sisters did a sweep of the area around Caleb's property for anything suspicious. Thankfully, nothing was out of the ordinary much to everyone's relief. Lyca asked if she could sleep over with Zwei for the night to which Caleb allowed. After Caleb armed the security system to his house for the night, Ein and her sisters, along with Lyca, went next door. Before leaving, Drei made sure to remind him to use the salve she made; making sure to emphasize the excruciating soreness his muscles will feel next morning if he doesn't.As he was turning in for the night, he felt an odd sense of Deja vu followed by a sinking feeling in his stomach. Immediately he takes out his phone and goes to his weather app checking the forecast. He scrolled through and breathed sigh relieved to see it was only a third quarter moon tonight. As exhausted, in every sense of the word, that he was he REALLY couldn't handle two full moons in a row. He got to his door which still had the protruding indentation from Camilla's hit. Eh, he'll call someone tomorrow about it. He was about to enter the quiet sanctum that was his bedroom for some much needed rest when..."C-caleb Dear?", came the voice of Mirabelle. He turned to see her standing with her door partially open, "C-can I perhaps see you...for a bit? I-in my room?"As exhausted as he was, he knew he couldn't resist when she asked him like that. Curse those adorable purple peepers!"Sure, just give me five minutes, K?", Caleb replied before entering his room closing the door; oblivious to the delighted blush on her cheeks.He changed into a plain purple t-shirt and black pajama bottoms and applied the salve Drei left him on his arms, legs, and lower torso. It had a pungent scent to it, kinda like ginger. But what was on his mind was seeing what Moon pie wanted so he could get some rest already. He left his room and lightly knocked on her door."Come in.", Her voice muffled as he opened the door; of course using extra effort since it still had freakin metal slabs in it. He walks in to see her near her bed beckoning him over, "Please...sit Dear."He raised an eyebrow in suspicion but complied with her request and sat down on the soft mattress. He then noticed she appeared to be fidgeting and repeatedly glanced at him nervously. It didn't take a genius to know something was wrong."Something wrong Moon pie?"Mirabelle snapped herself out of it suppressing the urge to retreat, "N-no, I'm okay. I-I just wanted to thank you. For everything you've done for me. For all of us.""Oh, well, don't mention it, just doing whatever I can to help you guys. I'm sure if our roles were reversed, you'd probably do the same for me.", Caleb replied.Mirabelle looks away pensively, "That's just it. I don't think I could've, and certainly not how I was earlier this morning. I thought everything was over for me and I... didn't want...to go on anymore.", She says before looking to him with elated eyes, "But you...you came to me and showed me how much I mattered. You saved me Caleb. Not only that, you brought us all closer. I feel closer to Lyca and now Ms. Sartana and I are actually friends. I have to give back."Caleb leaned in and kissed her forehead, "You don't have do anything. I'm just glad I could help at all. Besides, you guys did the bonding yourselves. All I did was get you all together.""D-dear, Do you...do you remember when you said we all deserve a do-over?", She asks eyes filling with devotion and a soft tone."Yeah...what exactly-Wah!", Caleb gasps flinching as he suddenly felt her hand clumsily stroking his crotch. He saw her face flushed red with desire and slight embarassment, "Moon pie! W-what are you...?""I...I want a second chance to show how much I love you. The right way, with all my heart and soul.", Mirabelle utters feeling her breath quicken as he grew harder. Though her pace was erratic and imprecise, Caleb still trembled from her touch."M-moon pie...stop hold up a second.", Caleb says clasping her hand making her cease her movements. She looked at him worried she was overstepping as he calmed himself, "You don't have to force yourself to do anything? I know you love me.""I-I know I don't HAVE to, but I want to. It's just...I've never done anything like this before.", she then blushes covering her lips, "I-It's embarrassing to say but I recently started reading this book on...stuff like this...and I...have may learned some things.", she murmurs embarassment while pulling a medium sized book from under her mattress handing it to him hesitantly. His jaw dropped flipping through it shocked by the hyper-realistic images of male and female genitalia, step-by-step instructions on different sexual acts and positions, and even a list of natural aphrodisiacs. She's been reading stuff like THIS?!Caleb paused taking in the fact she went through this much effort...for him. One hand he was very flattered on another GODDAMN! He then smiled realizing her words were sincere and she really wanted to do this, "You are something else Moon pie. I mean that in the sweetest way possible. Honestly, I wouldn't mind showing my love too. But let's take our time, you're not the only one who isn't quite used to this stuff( unless late night hentai streams count), he says the last part under his breath ""What was that Dear?", she asks puzzled."I-I said let's both do our best.", he quickly corrected.Mirabelle smiled happily at him, "Yes, of course love. B-but...I only want to try this much for now. I'm not ready for...other things...just yet.", she says before turning the book to page 69. Caleb's eyes widen as he blushes."Oooh, look at you Miss Naughty.", Caleb smirks cheekily to which she giggled bashfully. He scoots closer cupping the side of her face as she nuzzled his palm and gazed at him lovingly. They leaned to each other for a passionate kiss.~WARNING! Lemons!~Their lips interlocked as they each savored the taste of each other. Their breathing became more ragged as their hunger for each other grew more intense. They each other close with Mirabelle's soft breasts mushing into his chest. Pretty soon, Mirabelle became bold enough to demand access with her tongue which Caleb eagerly welcomed. The sound of smacking and low grunts and moans filled their ears spurring them to explored every nook and craney of each other's mouth. Heat between them grew as they continued their make-out session. Like last time, Mirabelle took a more submissive allowing him to take the dominant role.Finally, they separated to catch their breath while staring at each other adoringly. Caleb noticed the look in her eyes was different from the previous night. There wasn't purely just desire in them. There was devotion and trust. He then noticed her eyes were fixated downwards with deepening blush before realizing he had a huge erection outlining his PJs. She gulped her hand trembling as she repeatedly reached and pulled back unsure of herself; which Caleb picked up on."It's ok. It's ok, Moon pie, just go slowly.", Caleb speaks softly in encouragement."Y-yes, um...c-can I...see it?", she asks nervously."Yeah", Caleb nods before unbuttoned his pajamas pulling them down along with his underwear. She gasps as his full hardened length springs forth. Her eyes widening and her agape in shock as her mind went blank. The real thing was much different than what she seen in the book but still very fascinating, "You can do more than just look you know.", he says comfortingly taking her hand bringing it to his shaft. He trembles a bit feeling her fingers against him while she softly exhaled. She lightly grabs him feeling how strong it was and the heat seemed it was going to melt her palm."Don't rush yourself, take it slow. Start by going up and down.", Caleb encouraged snapping her out of her daze as he guided her."Ok, I-I'll b-begin", She uttered as her heart beat furiously. She started by gently stroking him underneath from base to tip before wrapping her hand around his shaft; as much as she could at least. She focused on stroking him up and down starting of slow before gradually picking up the pace. Caleb shifted under her groaning in pleasure as she jerked him off with silky soft hands."Does this feel good? Am I doing it right Dear?", she says with concerned expression."I-it's great haaa Moon pie...you're doing great. K-ack...keep going.", Caleb strains out. Mirabelle smiled in relief before refocusing on her task. she continued for a couple minutes as the musky, yet gingery scent emanating his region grew stronger. It smelled strange but she didn't dislike. In fact, it aroused her even more as her thoughts became hazy and her hot breath blew against his member sending chills down Caleb's spine. Only one thought repeated in her mind compelling her bring her face closer to the tip. She gave it a taste which made Caleb jump suddenly bringing her out of the trance."Ah! I'm sorry Dear! I-I didn't me-Did I hurt you?", Mirabelle ceased afraid she did something wrong."No,no , that just...felt so good it surprised me.", Caleb assured her."Really?"Caleb petted her head, "Yeah, it felt amazing. You...wanna keep going? We can stop if you don''t want to""No, I said I want to do this.", She says before grabbing him at the base making him tense slightly. She gave him a few more experimental licks at the tip watching before swirling the hot, wet muscle around the head eliciting sweet moans from Caleb. Boosting her confidence, she dragged her tongue up and down his shaft; licking and sucking and leaving every inch covered in hot saliva. She loved how good he tasted and couldn't stop herself. Caleb clenched his teeth sucking in air and gripped the mattress tightly as pleasure eroded any rationality he had left.Mirabelle soon wanted more of him as she eyed his glistening member hungrily while panting. She open her mouth sucking on his head swirling her tongue around. The moist hot sensation drove Caleb sense into overdrive as he threw his head up to the ceiling moaning loudly.She then felt Caleb's hand on her head petting her encouragingly as she continued, "GAhhhahhh H-Hollllly shit, Moon pie...that Ahhagh feels so good. Oh fuck...", He said through erratic breath. Mirabelle giggled delightedly as she sucked him; the vibrations sending more pleasure through his body. She wondered how much of him she could fit. She curled her lips a bit further down until she filled her mouth with half his shaft before slowly bobbing her head. His member jabbed and scaled against her cheeks and roof of her mouth. Caleb breathed harder running his fingers through her hair as she sped up her pace. He felt her hands grip his sides for more support. The insane amount of ecstasy he was feeling from her fellatio required all his concentration to keep from blowing his load right then and there. He then felt her take more of him in her; this would've been his limit when she suddenly made a gagging sound and pulled off of him coughing."Hahh...Moon pie.", He says concerned while catching his breath, "You alright?""*cough* Y-yes. I just...pushed myself too much. Please, let's keep going", says placing her hands on his sides with a look of solemn determination."Ok, but no need to choke yourself. You doing fantastic as you are.", Caleb grins as she smiles appreciatively at him before a lightbulb went off in her head."Dear, I just remembered something else I read that I'd like to try", she says while unbuttoning her shirt from the bottom. Caleb watched in anticipation as she exposed more of her flesh. Slowly to a stop when got to her now partially exposed breasts. He then noticed her nervous expression and looking up at him, "U-um, I...c-can you...perhaps do the...last one Dear?:Caleb gulped audibly, "S-sure", he says as he reached both hands underneath her breasts making her shudder against his touch. Pushing them up, the last came loose and Caleb jaw dropped as her creamy double D rosy red tipped orbs bounced into full view. He noticed she wasn't wearing a bra either; clear that she was intending to do this from the start. She then quickly covered her nipples much to Caleb's confusion."P-please don't stare so much. Now, um lie down", She requested and he did as told lying sprawled on the bed. She position herself with her front legs at the sides of his thighs before bringing her chest to his groin.'Holy shit is do she gonna do what I thiiiiiiiiiiiii-", Caleb mentally screamed as her warm, soft mounds of flesh enclosed around his manhood in a silky grip. Mirabelle shuddered feeling his hot meat rod against her sensitive flesh. She grinned at how cute it was when it poked out and went back inside her breasts; like peekaboo."H-how do my b-breasts feel, D-dear?", She shakily asked kneading her breast up and down."great *clears throat* It's great please continue.", Caleb voice cracks but quickly corrects himself. Mirabelle giggles to herself at how adorable he was.Mirabelle thought back on what she read and began kneading her breasts around his cock in a circular motion. Caleb moaned and groaned shifting with every motion she made and encouraging her to increase her pace. His precum collected on her breast, lubricating his shaft making it slide in and out more easily. The scent once again intoxicating her sense and driving her into single minded lust. She licked his head every time it poked out enjoying the someone salty taste of precum before taking him in her mouth once. Caleb groaned lustfully from the double stimulation. Good thing the walls in her room were partially sound proof for some reason. She kept bobbing her head while her tits sandwiching him in undulating flesh."Haahh ghahh M-moon pie, I can't Haghh...I'm gonna cum.", Caleb warned between moans. This only made her increase her pace even more.Mirabelle could feel his manhood twitching in her mouth, "Thash fine...gwo awead, cum fwor me!"Caleb instinctively grabs her head guiding downwards and feeling her pointed ears, "Ghaahaaa Moon pie ah Fuuuuuck!", he moans releasing into her mouth as her eyes widening at the unexpectedly high volume of hot liquid. She gulped some of it down before gasping and popping off him; his white, hot liquid covering the upper portion of her breasts, rim of her mouth, and even her hair bangs. She seemed to fall in to a trance staring wide-mouthed and eyes suddenly glowing before slowly dimming. Both of them panted furiously trying to catch their breath.They soon were able to recover themselves before they were staring into each other's eyes."Haah, damn Moon pie...just...just damn. That was amazing.", Caleb praised before noticing the...condition of her face, "Oh, uh, I'm...so sorry for all of...that."Mirabelle giggles innocently, "It's ok Dear. I'm happy you did this to me. It proves how much you love me.", She closes her eyes licking the cum at the top of her lip tasting with Caleb raising an eyebrow. She smiled reopening her now glowing purples eyes , "Besides, you taste really good Dear."Caleb rubbed the back of his head, "Hehe, well...um ok. But, you should probably clean it off now.""Certainly.", She complies before reaching under her mattress again. This time pulling out a package of wet wipes and opening it up. Caleb raised an eyebrow."Uhh, why do you have those? And why were they in the same spot as the book?", Caleb inquired already guessing the answer."Oh, um n-no reason in particular", She blushed clearly embarrassed touching the tips of her fingers in a vain display of innocence. Caleb nodded in an 'Mmhmm' fashion unconvinced. She cleaned herself off getting every inch off her breasts and her face. Caleb noticed there was still a bit in her bangs.He grabs a wet wipe, "Hold still, you a little up here.", he says wiping her hair clean, "There we go.""Thank you, Dear.", She smiles sweetly at him."Well, now that you're all clean, guess it's my turn.", Caleb finished in a mischievous tone."For whaHAAhahghhhhhhh!", She exclaimed as Caleb grabbed handfuls of her breasts and squeezing them vigorously, "Haagghhh...Dear, W-w-w-w-what at you doing?!"Caleb grinned rogishly while continuing assault, "Just a little payback for your surprise fondling earlier, and these creme puffs are just begging for attention.", he then got closer to her quivering form until his lips were right against her ear, "Besides, I don't think it's fair that I'm the only one being serviced here."Mirabelle wanted to answer back but found her words distorted into sporadic moaning and unintelligible pleasure noises. He increased his ferocity; kneading and contorting flesh in a variety of shapes, massaging them, and even planting kisses every so often. The little Nightmare was practically bursting at the seams as every inch of her trembling body recieved waves of ecstasy she never even knew existed. Her tail whipped about erratically sending purple mist around the room as her horsey rear grinded excitedly against the hem of the bed. Her womanhood, both of them, were leaking like faucets right now."Mwahhaahhh...haaw...C-Caleb...you're hrwaaa...being s- so rough", She strained.Caleb was proud he was getting a favorable reaction despite not really knowing what the hell he was doing. Then an idea, influenced by a video he watched in his alone time, popped up. He stopped his groping, to Mirabelle's confusion, then squeezed her hardened nipples pulling them hard."WRHAAAAAA! ", She exclaimed arching her back throwing her head to the ceiling, "N-n-no, not there! I'm too sensitive!""I had a feeling. Mmmm, I wonder what happens if I do...this!", Caleb giggles feigning ignorance before stroking her nipples in a motion similar to milking a cow. Mirabelle squirmed and moaned loudly in pure bliss as jolts of pleasure surged in every nerve in her body.Mirabelle eyes roll to the back of her head, "Hhaghhh...I-I-I-I feel like I'm floating away...m-my mind...is going blank."Caleb released one of her breasts and wrapped his arm around her eliciting a squeak from her. He then peppered her neck in kisses and caressed her back from her skin to her velvety fur. All while massaging her left breast. Honestly, it took a lot of his concentration to achieve this synchronization but it worked; very well."~C-Caleb...Caleb. It's feels so goooood! More. I want more~", She croons while unfastening her cloak and pushing the front portion down her lower half. Caleb stopped his motions eyes widened seeing her womanhood for the first time. It was neatly trimned almost hairless save for the V-shaped stubble and she was dripping wet. Caleb marveled at the area as if he was looking at the most beautiful thing on earth; all monuments pale in comparison. She gently lifted his chin the meet each other's gaze. Her eyes were glazed with love, trust, and desire and smiled at him before gently taking his hand guiding it to her entrance, "~ I want more. Please Dear, give me more of your touch!"Caleb pulled back a little at first feeling the situation starting to resemble how she was the previous night. That is until she kissed him on the cheek giving him a look that said 'It's OK'. Caleb smiled happy knowing it was truly her.He moved his hand to her folds and began caressing her with his index finger. He experimentally traced it feeling out the shape and warm wetness while Mirabelle clung to him shivering desperately clutching his shoulders. Caleb made a bold move and shoved his entire finger inside her causing to gasp at the sudden intrusion and hold him tighter. Caleb admired the hot, moist walls pulsating around his finger and began exploring more of her insides. Mirabelle buried her face in his neck kissing and licking his skin with her hot breath against him. He could feel her heart pounding almost in synch with his. He got hard again as prodded and scraped her walls as she wriggled, moaned, and gasped with each move he made. She felt his hardened dick rub against her stomach then instinctively grabbed him and began stroking him. Caleb tensed up, having cum previously he was pretty sensitive right now.Mirabelle gave a snarky grin, "I-I-If you WAHHGHH...wanna playyyhhh like that, I...caHAHGH too.", she utters gliding her palm teasingly up and down his shaft."Ha, Tha-hooo my girl!", Caleb smirked before adding his middle finger."Haghh...oh gods..Gods! Dear, I can feel something coming! Stir me up more! I'll...I'll do the same for you.", She moaned in his ear encouraging him even more before increasing the speed of her stroking."Hrrrghaaaaaaa...Moon pie...yeah baby, come on.", Caleb groaned as he felt her walls locking his fingers in a hot vice. He could feel his climax approaching the made hooking motion with his fingers. She lost it as her breathing became more erratic and her walls grew tighter."AHGhhg...D-Dear...I-I can't...h-hold...I'm H-HAAAAGGGHHHHHHH!" , "Moon pie!"Mirabelle screamed into his shoulder riding out her climax and leaving Caleb's hand drenched in her love nectar. Caleb grunted clenching his eyes as he rode out his climax out and covering the top of her stomach and part of her hand in semen. When they had each emptied themselves, they collapsed on the bed in exhaustion.~Lemonade~After a couple minutes, they were able to catch their breath. They lay next to each other-Mirabelle on her side and Caleb on his back-staring at each other smiling and giggling. They used the last of the wipes to clean themselves off."You...are a fast learner.", Caleb says playfully messing with her hoof, "You sure you needed a sex book for this?""Perhaps not, but I...assume it couldn't hurt to know...some things.", she replies returning a content grin.Caleb gave her a coy grin, "Do I even wanna ask where you got this 'how-to' sex manual?""No.", she answered plainly but whimsically, "and it shall remain a mystery?""Fair enough.", Caleb chuckled before looking down at the sheets below them now stained in their sweat and love juices, "Ah damn, you're poor sheets.""It's ok, I was going to do laundry tomorrow anyway.", She whispers before moving closer to cuddle. She draped her horse legs around his thighs and nuzzled head into his chest with a content hum.Caleb wrapped an arm around her human half and gently caressed her cheek, "Well, this mess IS half mine, so I'll help you.""Thank you, Dear.", she purred sweetly pecking his cheek, "This...may sound uncouth...but I...wouldn't mind you getting me messy again.""Heh, nowww look who's the pervert.", Caleb teased playing with her ear, "I'll take you up on that."Mirabelle blushed happily crooning next to him as tiredness began to overtake her, "I love you, Dear.", she whispers before falling asleep in his embrace."I love you too.", Caleb whispers in her ear. He played with her hair locks as she softly snored into his chest.'Welp, I did the one thing I wasn't supposed to. On top of that, I blackmailed MON agents to keep my secret. I could spend the rest of my life in prison. So...why am I so happy?!", Caleb thought looking at the beautiful girl sleeping next to him, 'I have to be very careful. I promise, I won't let anyone take you away, Moon pie.'Caleb held her tight before finally drifting off to slumber. Unaware of the glowing red eyes in the crack of the door before softly closing it. It was Camilla, having previously been awaken by the strange noises (thanks to her super sensitive hearing) and went to investigate. What she didn't expect to find was Señor and Señorita Mirabelle...She went back to her room repeatedly telling herself 'it was none of her business' before locking herself in for the rest of the night to sort out her...complicated feelings.WRYou the readers: "So how long are going to make the Lemon scene?"Me: "YES!"But in all seriousness, Hi Fam, hope life's treating you guys well.

    Chapter Text
    Chapter 17: A Delightful OutingThree days have passed and life in the Bizzell household continues as normal; or at least what counts as normal.Caleb continued with his usual work schedule; either going into the office or getting visits from Rodney to go over project details. In the office, Caleb would still experience coworkers slandering him behind his back, but he was learning to tolerate it. That, however, was easy compared to getting used to the Zyklons following and watching him from afar; sometimes even in plain sight. Usually it'd just be two of them surveying him while one stayed near his home. Also, due to Caleb officially caring for three or more liminal students, he received an increase in the monthly stipend from ICEP.After work, he'd spend some quality time with the girls; teaching them more about Alabama culture, learning more about each of them and their species, or just plain relaxing together. In the time Mirabelle and Lyca have been living him he's learned quite a lot about Nightmare and Werewolf customs and practices; the former of which he'd keep notes of to send to Sterling. Apparently, Nightmare are broken into four clans within the United Kingdom-Eclipse, Crescent Moon, Dusk, and Star-with Mirabelle belonging to Crescent moon clan. Evident by the imprint on Caleb's chest. Turns out clans aren't exactly nomadic but instead have small farming settlements hidden throughout different parts of Europe that they move between to avoid detection. He learned Mirabelle's clan is most adept in agriculture so much they've had cohabitating relations with Dryads and each clan lives in a caste system led by a High Priestess. They even use their dream manipulation for gathering information on the outside world such as politics, advancements in technologies, and even entertainment. Mirabelle even confessed it was through this she discovered her love of Sailor Moon. After pressing her about her abilities during the full moon, he learned of the Nightmare's natural affinity for stealth and energy transmutation. The mist released from their tails allows them to erase their presence, camouflage themselves, and perform teleport short distances. Lastly, he learned she was an only child and grew up in her village in England's forests.He learned from Lyca that Werewolves are the most territorial of the Kobold species. Most apparent when he caught her "marking" the entire area around the outside of the house; which he immediately reprimanded her about it. Their fangs and claws need to be used consistently filed to avoid growing discomfort. He learned this the hard way when he found bite and claw marks all over the legs of his dining room table; which he also reprimanded her about and bought her a special tool to help canine liminal in that regard. It's kind of like a scratching post designed for canines. He even learned a little more about her pack; including her strained relationship with her siblings and parents.He hasn't really learned much else about Elder devils from Camilla yet. However, he has learned that her species needs to perform a kind of ritualistic meditation to control their "demonic energy" from leaking out. Otherwise, they could grow erratically aggressive and truculent. He's also learned she's not very...tech-savvy; evident by her confusion and frustration when playing video games and not being familiar with the internet. He started teaching her much to her embarrassment and gratitude....It was the weekend now. Caleb didn't have to go in the office and he finished going over the other specs with Rodney, so he was essentially free to do whatever he wanted."Girls, the trolley will be here any minute! You ready?!", Caleb called out standing with the front door open."I'm ready Chief!", Lyca states appearing from the hallway carry a grey drawstring bag and dressed in her usual ripped blue jean shorts, camo tube top, and grinning happily as her tail wags happily, "So excited to be spending the weekend having fun with you and everyone!"Caleb smiled back at her; indeed, he could understand her excitement. It has been awhile since he's really taken them out of the house to truly experience more of American life; that was his job after all. Admittedly, last month's events have made him a bit paranoid around strangers but if he was near familiar faces like Mirabelle or Lyca he felt a little more at ease."Heh, yeah me too, you know that camouflage looks great on you.", Caleb complimented. Her ears perk up as she blushes and smiling widely. It was true. It shaped around her chest nicely and have a nice view of her toned, sexy abs."Thanks Chief.", Lyca replied her tails wagging a hundred miles an hour"Are Mirabelle and Camilla ready yet?", Caleb inquired."Sorry Dear, it took me longer than expected to find my wallet. I don't know how it ended up behind my dresser.", Mirabelle stated walking out of the hallway sounding a bit annoyed. She was dressed in a lavender skirt covering her lower half with a golden moon buckle connecting to the front of her waist. Her white crescent moon t-shirt was covered by a light purple short-sleeve hoodie and a Sailor Moon pin in her hair. Seconds later, she was joined by Camilla."I am fully dressed Señor, there is no need to shout.", The demoness chides walking past Mirabelle and leaning against the kitchen counter. She was dressed in a jean skirt with thin, light brown stockings that complemented her shapely legs and brown heeled ankle boots. She had a dark blue tank top covered by a short sleeve denim jean jacket with openings for her large wings. She had a small blue carrying bag with a sketch pad sticking out."Yeah, sorry just don't want us to miss our ride is all.", Caleb gave them a sweet grin, "By the way, you two looks great. Moon pie, that pin in your hair makes you look even cuter and Camilla that tank really compliments your eyes."Both flushed embarrassed shades of pink."T-thank you Dear.", Mirabelle utters."G-gracias, but w-where did that come from so suddenly.", Camilla inquired still a bit flustered."Ha, I think just Chief's feeling complimentary today.", Lyca chimes in."Not how that word works and... well, I read somewhere it's good to give women compliments like that when going out in public. Helps lessen anxiety and self-consciousness.", Caleb explained earning skeptical yet amused looks from them."Well...it's still sweet of you Dear, no matter how odd your logic may be.", Mirabelle giggles walking over to boop him on the nose. Caleb grins awkwardly rubbing the back of his head. He then notices Camilla's sullen expression before turning away when their eyes met. Caleb frowned slightly wanting to say something but was interrupted by a familiar bell chiming accompanied by a rumbling engine."Oh, looks like our ride's here.", Caleb says turning to see the large bus-like trolley pulling to a stop as a few humans and liminals started to board on the opposite end of the street. Caleb moves out of the way as Mirabelle and Lyca step outside to board the trolley. Camilla is the last to come out as she curiously observed the bizarre vehicle. Caleb turned to lock the door and activate the security system then felt a small gust of wind blow past him. He looks in the direction it came and notice the Zyklons perched atop the roof of two-story house giving thumbs-up/'You good' gestures. Caleb returned the gesture before they seemingly teleported away.Caleb goes up next to Camilla, "I take it it's your first time riding a liminal bus?", he says snapping her attention."Jes it is. Honestly, I still find it interesting just how much ju humans improve your means of travel. When I was little girl, ju were all just mounting horses ever.", She giggles before realizing how that last part may have sounded, "O-oh but of course I mean regular horses NOT Centaur-""Hey, hey it's fine, I get what ya mean.", he says giving her a reassured pat on the shoulder, " Besides, it's still pretty common to see people riding horses down South. Not really on public highways or in cities but..."Suddenly the driver blew his horn."Come on, let's get on before they leave us behind.", Caleb says gesturing for her to follow.Camilla nods and quickly follows his lead, "S-Si, Señor."They boarded the trolley and immediately noticed there weren't many people on board; at least 7 humans, a lamia, a few were rabbits, a happy perched on the roof, and a lizardman. They took their seats as they pulled off the curb leaving Caleb's neighborhood.Ten minutes pass and people have come and gone at certain stop points. During the ride, Caleb sat next to Mirabelle chatting with her while Lyca watched the scenery pass and hanging partially out the window like an actual dog. Camilla sat directly across from the pair occupying herself by sketching as she looks at him and Mirabelle. She would avert her gaze whenever he met eye contact. He occasionally caught glimpses of her deeply somber almost longing expression as she stared between them and her sketch pad.He wasn't oblivious to her emotions. Ever since he came out about his and Moon Pie relationship, Camilla had become a bit more anxious around him; even distancing herself when he was with Moon pie. He knew she still has feelings for him. Perhaps still holding on to that whole 'Destined one' thing. After suffering for so long the way she did, he guessed it made sense she would feel devastated to finally find someone love then to learn they're already in love with someone else. Honestly, he was partly using today's outing to spend a little more time with Camilla just to show her he does love her but as a friend; and that IS ok. If it really looks like she's not warming up to that idea, he'll just bust out his secret weapon.A few more minutes and they finally arrive to their destination. Lyca and Mirabelle stand on the sidewalk anxiously waiting for their host and roommate. Caleb stepped off the trolley with Camilla right behind him. Camilla's eyes widened seeing the cavalcade of colorful buildings, shops, restaurants. A large lake with manmade stream walkways leading into a tall, pristine fountain in the center of town. Mini gondola ferrying passengers across the water could be seen in the distant sparkling clean waters. A stone walkway could be seen leading into a wooded island with several memorial sites. The roofs and walls of several shops were painted in a hodgepodge of colors. Many humans and various liminals could be seen moving about shopping, chatting, or just dining. Camilla stepped closer mesmerized by the beautifully lively area.Caleb stepped to her side and did a welcoming bow towards the entrance, "Señora Sartana, welcome to the best shopping district in Huntsville, Bridge Street Town Center, weird name but great place to relax."Camilla cracked a smile before giggling, "hohohohoho, ju are ridiculous Señor. But, I must say, it is very beautiful place and so big. It is...quite crowded though. ""Don't worry, we can always find somewhere quiet to decompress. ", Caleb spokes in a supportive tone."Yeah, Cam, plus you'll love it here!", Lyca added, "We come here all the time with Chief. There's soooo many things to do!""T-there's no need to be nervous, we're all here together.", Mirabelle said smiling at her.Caleb smirks at Mirabelle, "Now there's something I never thought I'd hear. Moon pie calling someone else nervous. First time we came, you wanted me to stand out the public women's rest room. I got sooo many weird looks.""I-I was still adjusting to the environment!", Mirabelle exclaims in embarrassment before puffing her cheeks trying to look angry, "Maybe you got weird looks because you look like a mean tosser""Eh, I am a little bit. Does that make me any less of a gentleman?", Caleb replied slyly.Mirabelle put her finger to her chin pretending to think, "I suppose, though your decorum could use a bit of work."Caleb playfully groans at her as Lyca and Camilla giggle at their little comedy routine."Hoho, gracias, but I'm not nervous. I... just have a habit of avoiding areas with too many humans. I have...less than pleasant experiences before.", Camilla explained earning varying reaction between them."That's ok, but things change Camilla. Look over there, there's a literal Mermaid girl in a wheelchair next to a literal Moth girl with a group of four Sunni Muslim girls...all of them eating sushi served by crab people", he says pointing to scene before continuing, "This country is a melting pot of diversity. I think hardly anyone is going to make that big a deal over one devil woman. Come on, let's go enjoy a bit of Southern hospitality."Camilla ponders for a second then nods, "Ok, I trust ju Señor.""Let's go ride the gondola again!", Lyca exclaimed grabbing Caleb's arm. Then Mirabelle grabs his other arm."Wait, let's go to Kami House first. There's this amazing series called 'Parfait Girls' that I'd like find the second volume of.", Mirabelle rebutted. Caleb then released himself from their grip facing all three of them"Now now girls, we're here to first show Camilla a bit of cherished Alabama history. We're going to take the stone walkway to the memorial site.", Caleb says gesturing to the far off wooded island, "AFTERWARDS...we can ride to gondola back and go to Kami House. Then we can go to some of the other shops."Mirabelle and Lyca nodded to each other and grinned at him. Caleb then turned to Camilla who had an interrogative look."That sound good to you Camilla or...did you maybe want to do something else?"Oh, no Señor it's perfecto. Lead the way!", Camilla proclaims forcing the enthusiasm a bit."Alright, then let us make haste my friends. There's stuff to learn and even more fun to be had.", Caleb stated as they made their way through the area. As they passed by some of the stores, small gusts of wind blew as their legs accompanied by confused statements from random shoppers. Lyca was playfully running and skipping around them as they passed the large fountain. Camilla glanced at Caleb noticing his pace constantly shift so he was always walking side-by-side between her and Mirabelle. A small grin forming at the notion of him wanting to make sure she's included. It then faded when she noticed a few humans they passed stop to stare at her with a combination of shock, fear, or disdain. Her ears twitch at their hateful comments but none of them were anything she hasn't heard before. Still, she felt uneasy once again. She looked to the human walking next to her then down at his hand swaying limply as he moved. She wanted nothing more at that moment than to clasp her hand to his; to feel safe and accepted. However, he was already holding Mirabelle's hand and retreated deciding it was best she respect her set boundaries and ignore those wretched humans on the sidelines. Right now, she'll just be content having him by her side....Nearby...Ein lay on her stomach atop one of roofs of the shopping district watching Caleb and the girls through binoculars. She kept a close watch on people around them watching for anyone that exhibits suspicious behavior."Hmm, so far no incipient threats.", She whispers to herself rising partially off her chest. Zwei suddenly appears with a small breeze making no sound. She smiles wickedly while creeping over to her sister with her hand raised. Her eyes narrowed at Ein's peach shaped butt and prepared to strike."Do it, and I shave your tail bald!", Ein stated threateningly still surveying Caleb.Zwei pauses then shrugs, "Eh, I could probably pull it off; maybe even start a new fashion trend.""Congratulations, you've just invented the Demi-human equivalent of socks and sandals.", came the voice of Drei as her sisters turned to the sound of her voice. She was hanging upside down from a horizontal flag pole flying the state flag before acrobatically dismounting with a double flip landing next to them on her tip-toes, "I've searched all of the patrons around Mr. Bizzell. None of them appeared to be carrying any particularly irregular items-save for a few cheaply made pocket knives.", Drei emphasizes letting several pocket knives fall out of her sleeves."Nothing unusual on the ride over either and there doesn't appear to be any suspicious characters nearby.", Zwei stated."Ok, they've almost made it to that memorial site. Zwei, head over and sweep the area.", Ein commanded sitting up on her knee.Zwei roll her eyes with a smirk, "Aye aye Lieutenant Thunder Thighs!", she exclaimed before zooming past them in a sharp gust leaving a flustered and frustrated Ein behind."D-D-Don't call me that!", Ein whines messing with the flap of her geisha to cover her rear and tail around her thighs, "A-Are they...really that f-f-f-", Ein stutters tears forming unable to say the word before Drei interrupted."Thick? Yes, you are; you're thick with 4 'C's", Drei answers plainly."That not what I was going to say!", Ein stated becoming even more flustered."No, it's what the internet says.", Drei answers back, "Now go save some lives!"Ein gives an exasperated sigh, "Just...just go help Zwei. I'll continue to watch from above.""Can do. By the way, this may sound weird, but do you feel a draft?", Drei inquired earning a confused look from Ein. Ein's eyes widened when she noticed the condition of Drei's cloths; which were now full of holes"Ah, Drei your cloths.", Ein said standing up and earning a raised eyebrow from Drei, "What?""Uhhh...", Drei utters gesturing at the entire front of Ein's dress covers in little holes. Even one of her nipples was exposed. Both examine their clothes surprised by the state they were in then locking eyes with equally deadpanned and annoyed expressions."Zwei.", the stated in unison."Gods, I thought she grew out of this habit.", Ein bewailed."I was afraid this may happen again.", Drei says before reaching into in her dress pulling out a mini sewing kit, "Alright bend down, let's start with the nip slip."...The memorial site proved to be an enjoyable experience for Caleb and the girls. Mirabelle and Lyca already knew fair a bit about its cultural significance so he spent most of that time teaching Camilla. She appeared to quite be engaged in how the site was the finally resting place of a Civil War general who established several protected nature reserves around Alabama. Camilla even mentioned how she was teaching her first spells during that time.After getting their fill of history, they proceeded back to mainland on the gondola. It was enjoyable ride until they had to stop Lyca from hanging off the rails skating on the water...again. Their next destination was Kami House....Camilla wore a profoundly confused expression as she struggled to comprehend the bizarre structure before her. A large multi-colored store with multiple posters of anime and gaming characters and signs advertising new releases covered much of the outer glass. The roof had a large plastic purple turtle shell with what appeared to be a bald, bearded human in a Hawaiian shirt holding purple staff and giving a peace sign. She turned to Caleb hoping he would provide some insight only to see him and Mirabelle in a starry-eyed trance; as if they were staring in the face of God. Lyca then nudged Camilla's shoulder."They always get like this when come here. Give it a sec.", Lyca nonchalantly informs as her tail sways happily."Holy shit they have the Sword and Shield volume out!", "They have Sailor Moon Eternal first edition?!", The two exclaimed ecstatically. They both eagerly pushed the doors open disappearing inside. Lyca went to the door holding it open while gesturing Camilla to follow."Come on, I may not be in to books much, but there's lots of other fun stuff to do here.", Lyca stated before going inside. Feeling the only alternative was to stand outside with random strangers, she went inside to join them. Once again, her senses were assaulted by the sights before her. The building was filled with the sound of upbeat anime music, chatter, noises from the gaming lounge and the checkout counter. All around her, there seemed to be something to catch her eye. The strange balloon-like decorations of famous anime and video game characters. The beautifully decorated shelves full of a multitude of manga and other forms of literature. The display cases with highly valued vintage figurines of well-known gaming and anime characters with all kinds merchandise from board games to toys to clothing; some of which were tailored to various species. Then there was arcade-like room with machines imported straight from Japan. She was even more surprised to see a few human and even liminals dressed in strange, flamboyant costumes."Camilla, over here!", Caleb calls out from table near manga section getting the demoness' attention. She walks over to him ignoring the stares from a few people around her before finally arriving at the table. She saw Mirabelle behind him searching through the shelves while Lyca was enthralled watching two humans dancing on a machine with a flashing screen and waiting for a turn."So, waddaya ya think?" Caleb inquires.Camilla looks around trying to find the right word, "It's... different. Certainly nothing I am used to, and I do not understand anything I'm looking at...but it's all quite interesting.""Heh yeah I suppose it's kind of overwhelming for most normies but don't worry I'll teach you slowly.", Caleb says oblivious to the double entendre. Camilla, however, caught it and gave him an intrinsic look.Camilla followed him to a nearby shelf with Mirabelle still occupied in her search, "Perdomeme Señor, but how does any of this teach me about American culture?""Well, technically, it doesn't we're pretty much just hanging out. But we can choose to look at as an example of other cultures assimilated into this country and how Liminals will eventually follow that trend. You know, the whole 'melting pot' I mentioned earlier.", Caleb explained searching through the light novel section."I guess that works.", Camilla says with hint of incredulity in her voice, "Are there any books ju would recommend Señor?"Caleb pulls out book and presents it to her, "You seem like woman of refine taste, so I think this is up your alley.", he says before she takes in hand while flushing at his compliment. She examines the cover which featured a woman with devil horns wearing a beautiful red dress and a heroic, but average-looking man with a knight's sword."Maoyuu M-maou Yuusha?", Camilla experimentally reads out the title immediately feeling an odd sensation on her tongue speaking foreign language, "What is it about?""I'm not going to spoil too much, but gist of it is this Hero goes to slay the Demon King but later finds out the King is actually a woman, so really Demon Queen. Anyway, he learns she's not evil and wants bring humans and demons together to coexist peacefully. So, they set out on a journey to accomplish that.", Caleb explains.Camilla mused clearly intrigued by his explanation, "Interesante (interesting)""I've only watched like part of the anime but been meaning to read the book.", Caleb says as Camilla flipping through the pages."Dear, look!", Mirabelle happily chimes clipping up to Caleb with a small stack of manga, "I got the last copy of Eternal...and I found 2 volumes of Parfait Girls.", Mirabelle says with an aura of pride and she presented the laminated, plastic covered copy of the Sailor Moon manga."That great Moon pie, wish I had the same luck. The shelf with the 'Sword and Shield' volumes is empty as hell.", Caleb responds with slight defeat in his tone."O-oh, I'm sorry Dear.", Mirabelle says shifting into a concerned tone and demeanor. Caleb senses this and lays a hand on her head."Hey now, don't trip, I'll get a copy next time.", Caleb says patting her head, "You wanna read a little before we buy?"Mirabelle grins at him, "Yes Dear, I honestly want to read a little more into these volumes of Parfait Girls before I decide if I want to buy them.""I swear you're getting more like me by the day.", Caleb says half-sarcastically."Imitation IS the highest form of flattery.", She replies with a smirk."Why have flattery when I can have admiration?", Caleb quips returning a Cheshire-like grin. Mirabelle playfully pushes against his shoulder with chuckle. Caleb grins at her before noticing Camilla's engaged but annoyed expression and muttering in Spanish as she flipped through the book."You uh, you ok over there Camilla?", Caleb inquires as Mirabelle turns her attention to the frustrated demoness."J-Jes...I am fine, Señor.", Camilla answers trying to hide her frustration."Oh, what are you reading Ms. Sar-I... I mean Camilla?", Mirabelle inquired.Camilla closed the book showing the cover, "A novella Señor Caleb suggested.""You don't like it?", Caleb asked a bit concerned the content may have offended her somehow."No, no Señor that's not it. I...", Camilla trailed off looking away in embarrassment, "I can't read much of it. My English is good when spoken...but I still struggle with reading in your language."Caleb thought for a second before stepping up to her, "Oh is that all? No need to be embarrassed, that's what I'm here for remember? Come on, I'll help you read it."Camilla gave him a surprised and elated look. The last time she told a man that, he simply mocked her making her feel stupid."W-We can use the quiet room. I don't see many people in there right now", Mirabelle adds gesturing to the part of the building with a room surrounded by sound-proof glass walls with two long wooden tables and a large window."Sounds like a plan.", Caleb says before turning to Camilla, "You?""J-Jes muchas gracias, Señor.", Camilla replies before a thought occurs to her, "Wait, what about Señorita Lyca? Will she be ok by herself?"Suddenly, the sounds of people cheering could be heard near the gaming area. The three peered over to see a small crowd of humans and liminals surrounding the 'Dance Dance Revolution' stations and someone dancing to Ed Sheeran's 'Cross me'. Upon closer inspection, they realized in was Lyca. Her rhythmic and provocative movements were filled with energy that whipped the crowd into more of a frenzy. By the end of the song, Lyca lands with a backflip howling to the ceiling as people cheered with some even howling with her."I think she'll be fine", Caleb says turning to Camilla and Mirabelle who giggled at how much fun Lyca was having, "Let me see if I can find another copy of that Camilla. You guys go on ahead I'll be there in a bit.""Si Señor", "Ok Dear", both spoke before leaving as Caleb began searching the shelf where he found the first copy.A few minutes later Caleb returned to them. Mirabelle was sit-...well, more accurately, standing at the table already engrossed in one of the volumes and Camilla sat at the table with the book in front of her patiently waiting before noticing Caleb."Did you find another one Señor?", Camilla inquired."Yeah about that, looks like THAT is the only copy they have?", Caleb stated walking in to join them as Mirabelle finally notices his presence. Camilla gives a slightly disappointed before he continues, "Looks like we've just have to share."Camilla nods plainly with a hum. A couple second later his words fully register, "Q-Què?!", she gasps in surprise as he takes the seat next to her. Mirabelle looks up with equal parts surprised and anxious."What? I said I'd help you with read it and I figure sharing the same book would let me accurately see which words you have trouble with.", Caleb told them and himself while turning to the first page, "Plus, this is a really great story and I'm sure you'll enjoy it."Camilla mused for a second glancing at Mirabelle then to the table.Mirabelle gives a skeptical look at Caleb unsure of how to feel about the situation. Then Caleb locked eyes with her giving her look that said, 'It's ok, nothing's going to happen.' Mirabelle ruminated before giving him a small grin choosing to trust them.Caleb nods before scooting his chair closer to Camilla who instantly tenses up when their shoulders touch, "Alright, let's get started.", he says holding the book open from one side.Camilla's heart palpitated, and her wings and tail quivered as her cheeks flushed pink. She mentally smacks herself to regain control of herself then exhales taking the other half of the book in her right hand."S-Si, let us...Señor.", Camilla utters unable to suppress the small grin on her face....An hour and a half passes. In that time, Caleb and Camilla had gotten through two chapters of the light novel. She struggled with pronunciation of several adjectives and conjunctions, but Caleb would help her sound them out and explain their meaning within the sentence. As they continued into the story, Camilla expressed her fascination with its world building and even started becoming invested in the female lead's personality and motivation. Caleb was clearly putting in a lot of effort to ensure she fully appreciated the story which warmed her heart. She really enjoyed the relationship between the Demon Queen and the Human Hero so far; it made her think of her and Caleb in a way. It certainly didn't help they sitting shoulder-to-shoulder sharing quality time together almost...like a couple. A few times she had to suppress that thought; even fight the urge to pull him closer, rest her head on his shoulder, or wrap her tail around them. Across the table, Mirabelle would glance up at them curious of their conversation or short laughs they shared. She was a bit conflicted. One hand, she was glad to see two people she cared about enjoying themselves. On another...her boyfriend was uncomfortably close to a woman who, not even a WEEK ago, confessed she was in love with him. She had finally bonded with Camilla and wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. But...she decided she'd still watch them a bit.Another hour passes. Caleb and the girls finished their reading session in peace and were preparing to leave. They went to get Lyca from the gaming area only to find her surrounded by several humans and liminals many of whom praising her. Apparently, she had become quite popular lately thanks to her skills. After saying her goodbyes, Lyca rejoined Caleb's group. He purchased the new Sailor Moon and Parfait Girls volumes for Mirabelle much to her delight. Camilla, while unconvincing, wanted to put the novel back. Caleb didn't buy it knowing how engaged she was when they were reading and got it for her anyway; even insisting on reading with her again. She relented but wholeheartedly accepted his offer. As they were walking out of the building, Camilla looked back at the odd establishment then to her bag in hand. While she still doesn't understand anything in there, she at least feels like she understands a little more about Caleb; that was good enough for her."So, where to now gang?", Caleb asked as they strolled through shopping center."Can we get some food? I'm starrrrrving.", Lyca emphasizes rubbing her stomach."Heh, you should be hungry. Little dancing queen.", Caleb teased."Hey, you can't deny these moves son.", Lyca replies doing a smooth, stationary turn then striking a shoulder pose. Caleb and Mirabelle playfully made 'pffft' sounds while Camilla simply giggles in amusement."Nah but yeah, for I'm getting' kind of hungry too. What about you Moon pie? Camilla?", Caleb asked the them respectively."I am feeling a bit peckish myself.", Mirabelle replies."Si, I could go for something. Not sure what though.", Camilla answers."Well could go to this place nearby called 'Urban Cookhouse'. They got plenty of options that'll cater to each of your tastes.", Caleb says intriguing them.The group continued their way into the large complex passing a multitude of stores and crowds of people. Camilla could still feel the judgmental stares of the frequent passerby but ignored them. Soon they arrived in the food court area. There were 12 different restaurants lining the area with skylight above to allow natural light for the plants. Several large circular tables with red and white parasols seated dozens of people; mostly humans but also a few liminals with their hosts. The delicious fragrance of freshly cooked meals wafted through area inciting the growling stomachs of famished patrons.Caleb and the girls made their way through the crowd before arriving at Urban Cookhouse. The restaurant featured a very contemporary but modern Southern theme with decorations featuring everything from Crimson Tide football to Hollywood movies. In the far end, there was a small bar with a wide assortment of alcohol. Waitresses in yellow and black uniforms could be seen carrying plates and trays of food to patrons. There were tables and booths; some of which were occupied mostly by humans. The only liminals in the restaurant were two female Nekomata, a female dwarf, and a male Inari, each with their respective hosts. The scent of grilled meat and sautéed meals permeated the air while modern country rock played throughout the day and restaurant."Aww man can you smell that meat?", Lyca speaks with her tongue hanging out tail wagging excitedly."Yeah, smells like lunch.", Caleb stated walking up to the empty reception desk and ringing the bell. Immediately, an African-American woman in yellow and black uniform came from walking towards the podium."Welcome to Urban Cookhouse! Would you like a table or booth?", The podium woman spoke in chipper voice."We'll need a table that can seat myself and my wards.", Caleb stated as politely as possible while showing her his ICEP host ID."Ohhh, you're a host for ICEP. We just got some chairs and tables that can be adjusted to accommodate most liminals body types. The instructions are posted on the labels.", The woman answered typing on her touchpad before taking out a stack of menus, "You are at table 5, here are your menus."Caleb thanks her, grabs his menu, then went to their table. The woman greeted Caleb's homestays as they passed handing them each a menu. She hesitated, smile fading and eyes widening in shock, when Camilla stepped up. The woman avoided eye contact her voice becoming nervous as she shakily handed the demoness the plastic menu."Keep it.", Camilla uttered walking past to go sit with her host. The podium woman was confused but relieved at the same time.Camilla calmly takes her seat with her host family next to Caleb. Mirabelle was showing Lyca what different items on the menu meant. Caleb looks up from his noticing Camilla sit down with them."Where's your menu Camilla?", Caleb asks her before Mirabelle and Lyca turned their attention to her."No, Señor. I just didn't want it.", Camilla replies with a cold expression doing her best to control her tone, "I'm fine with whatever ju order."Caleb could feel something was off but knew pressing her would only make her more upset. Best let her come out on her own accord."Hey now, that's no good. It's not fair to you.", Caleb then showed her his menu, "Here, see anything you like?"Camilla expression softened before scanning the menu items as Caleb read out what some of them said. At that moment, another woman wearing the same uniform as the podium woman came from the doors to the kitchen. She came to Caleb's table with her touchpad and pen."Good afternoon, my name is Cheryl and I'll be your waitress today. Are you ready to order?", Waitress Cheryl spoke in an equally chipper tone."I am! I'd like two steaks with mashed potatoes and gravy but no green beans. Oh, and blueberry ice tea.", Lyca stated her tail wagging as it thumped against the chair.Waitress Cheryl smiled and giggled as she typed out the order, "Ok, anyone else?""Yes, I would like a large garden variety salad, no meat please. Oooh with a side of parmesan roasted carrots and a blueberry ice tea also but with a bit of honey.", Mirabelle says as the waitress types in her order before turning to Caleb and Camilla with a toothy grin. The two had been having a small discussion up until now; Camilla notices the annoying human woman staring at her."And what will you have sir and... ma'am?", Waitress Cheryl utters as Camilla glared at her with steely, unamused eyes."I'll have...the honey roasted garlic chicken with cheese broccoli and I'll have diet Dr. Pepper.", Caleb turn to Camilla, "Camilla?"Camilla glances at him before inhaling, "Cajun spiced baked chicken with red beans and rice. Water is fine."Waitress Cheryl types their orders down then beam at them, "Ok, your meals will be ready very soon.", she says before taking their menus then heading back to the kitchen.Caleb notices Camilla messing with the hem of the table with an irritated expression."Camilla, is everything alright?", he inquired as Mirabelle and Lyca took notice."Jes Señor, I am fine?", Camilla answers keeping her eyes fixated to table."You...don't look fine Ms. Sartana. Is there something bothering you? If so, we're here for you.", Mirabelle says with a worried expression."Moon Pie's right, you're safe here?", Caleb assures."Am I?", Camilla states coldly, "I haven't been the most welcome face since we've arrived. All these contemptible eyes staring at me and the awful things I hear them say. I ignore them of course but with my enhanced hearing their words still linger. Even now I hear every word whispered by the humans around us."Mirabelle, Lyca, and Caleb exchanged looks. Mirabelle noticed out the corner of her eye a group of people in a booth staring at them and whispering. There was an elderly woman who held up a small metal crucifix necklace and kissing it before muttering under her breath. Lyca focused her hearing and could indeed hear the mean things they were saying about her; she clenched her first emitting a low growl."Camilla, listen, I know it's easier said than done to just ignore what people say. Sometimes you just can't, especially when they're everywhere you go. But that's why we're all together today. We have each other so whatever they have to say don't mean shit.", Caleb says."Yeah, what Chief said. All of you are great and if anybody says otherwise I'll make them take it back...after I knock out their teeth.", Lyca emphasizes with an unhealthy smile cracking her knuckles. Mirabelle and Camilla gave her dubious looks"Hopefully we won't get to that point but like the enthusiasm.", Caleb says making Lyca chuckle happily, "So let's continue to enjoy our outing together and block out the bullshit."Camilla glances away a few times, "I-I know Señor, I do but...""Look if you hear something that's mess, just do what black people: 'Ain't got time for that' ", Caleb emphasizes making a gesture like he's pushing something to the side, "uh-oh here bullshit, Ain't got time for that'. Here come some more, 'Ain't got time for that' "Mirabelle and Lyca giggle at him as Camilla couldn't help cracking a smile."Oh, Moon pie, bullshit to your right"Mirabelle copied his gesture, " 'Ain't got time for that' ", She says chuckling alongside Caleb and Lyca with Camilla starting to giggle lightly."Bullshit, comin' at ya Lyca."" 'Ain't got time for that' ", She says with the gesture and adding the head rocking thing inciting harder chuckles as Camilla snorted a bit."Here that come bullshit pimpin' up on ya Camilla."Camilla smiled then did her own version of the gesture with her wings partially spread behind her, " 'Ain't got time for that'., Camilla burst into laughter unable to hold it and being joined by the others. The other patrons stared at their table in confusion."Oh now, girl put some swag on it.", Caleb commented as Camilla smiled at him."Thank you for waiting.', came the voice of Waitress Cheryl as she pushed a cart small cart with their food on trays. She went around the table individually handing everyone their meals, drinks, and cutlery, "Enjoy your meal.""Thanks!" "Gracias Señora!", Caleb and girls thanked her with Camilla putting in a bit more effort. The waitress was surprised but smiled at her before leaving. Lyca instantly dug into her steaks.Caleb gave Camilla a sly grin, "Someone is in a better mood.""Thanks to mi Anfitrión(host) and his weirdness.", Camilla replied cheekily."You get used to it.", Mirabelle added before eating a fork full of lettuce."Chief is Chief, nuff said.", Lyca tacks on."I guess my personality is an acquired taste.", Caleb says cuts off a piece of chicken then taking a bite, "Mmm, speaking of taste."...Minutes passed as Caleb and the girls enjoyed their lunch and each other's company. They cracked a few jokes here and there, talked about movies. Mirabelle and Caleb even had a little fun feeding each other parts of their food; Camilla watched them feeling a bit left out. That is until Lyca began sharing her mashed potatoes with Mirabelle and Caleb to which Caleb fed her a little of his chicken. Camilla, feeling less reserved, offered some of her chicken to Caleb who, at first put off by the nasal burning spicy aroma, gave it a try. It was spicy, sure, but also sweet and juicy which he kindly expressed much to the demoness' delight. It wasn't long before their table was full of pleasant conversation and literal bread breaking. For Camilla, the nasty comments made by some of the patrons seemed to fall on deaf ears....While that was going on, a silhouette of tall figure appeared came strolling through the shopping area. She had beautiful sunlight yellow blonde hair, ocean blue eyes, pearly white skin, and slim, dainty hands. Her attire consisted of blue skinny jeans, yellow blouse, dark blue high heels, and diamond necklace with a tiny inverted crucifix. Her appearance was that of a woman in her mid-20s with a slightly curvaceous figure, flat tight ass, B-cup breasts, long shapely legs, plump pink lips, and rosy cheeks. But her most striking features were her large snow-white angel wings.'Hmm, where shall I dine today.', She gracefully strolls before he attention came to sign that said, 'Urban Cookhouse' before smirking, 'This seems like a quaint area and maybe the humans here are just as gullible.'...Back to Caleb's group, they were just finishing their meal. The waitress had returned inquiring if they wanted dessert. Caleb declined deciding to be a good boy while Mirabelle and Camilla ordered the strawberry cheesecake and Lyca wanted the apple pie."Perdomeme Señora, where is your restroom?", Camilla asked the waitress."Yes, it's around that corner women to the left.", she answered."Gracias.", Camilla replies before getting up following the directions she was told. A minute later, the elderly Caucasian woman got up grabbing her walking cane and headed there too...."Good afternoon, my child.", the angel spoke in a grandiose fashion. The lady at the front desk stood speechless at the heavenly being before her and couldn't help grinning ear to ear."I-I... yes, good afternoon! Welcome, ha-ha I'm sorry but...it's just...you're an angel!", the podium lady giggles trying to contain her excitement.'Ugh, another one THESE humans.', the angel thought while maintaining an accepting smile before saying, "Ah yes, and I'm happy to be greeted by one of my master's beautiful creations."The podium lay beams at her, "O-oh thank you but it's an honor to have a true emissary of the Lord here. You know I always, always pay my tithes and our Pastor has-""Yes, that's wonderful!", the angel interrupts, "However, I am quite exhausted from my...angelic...duties and would like rest and partake of your earthly cuisine.""Oh, oh I'm sorry, please right this way, taking any table you wish ma'am.", the podium lady says handing her a menu."Certainly, bless you child.", the angel grins while thinking, ' Motor-mouth idiot."...Moments later Camilla exited the women's restroom, having finished washing and drying her hands, and made her way back to her table. She suddenly finds herself face-to-face with the old woman who pauses starring dumbfounded at Camilla."Oh, perdomeme Mada-", Camilla put her hand up excusing herself when the old woman let out a startled shriek. The patrons, including Caleb's table, turned to the source of the noise. The old woman pointed her cane at Camilla screaming hysterically while stepping backwards, "No no, it's ok Madam-""Stay aw-AHH", the old woman shrieks before tripping over her foot landing on her back with a loud thud."HEY!", a hefty, bald man from yelled out angrily jumping his booth rushing over to his mother who was groaning in pain, "YOU GET THE HELL AWAY FROM HER!", the man yelled with a facing looking like he was going to rip Camilla to shreds. Instinctively, knowing he won't listen no matter what she says, she prepared to defend herself with all she had. Suddenly, Caleb jumped up and rushed to her."Whoa, whoa sir calm down a second.", Caleb interjected as the man stopped glaring furiously between him and Camilla while seeing about his mother. Mirabelle turned to them worriedly and Lyca went into full attack mode watching the irate man's every move prepare to defend Camilla and her Chief."Calm down. Calm down?! That damn hell spawn attacked my mother and you expect me to CALM DOWN?! Who you think you are, asshole!", The man growled."Listen, sir I'm her host for the Exchange program, I'm responsible for her and I saw everything. Camilla wasn't attacking her, your mom just tripped, and she was trying help her-", Caleb explained only to be interrupted when the man stepped up towering a foot over Caleb."Horseshit. That thing is a spawn of Satan! She's evil, purely evil! And you let it live with you?! You're just as much to blame your worthless fuck!", the man shouted as Caleb refused to back down for fear of what he's do to Camilla. Or more accurately, what CAMILLA would do to him. Even from behind he could feel her rage burning and her piercing demon eyes narrow at the man. A younger woman, possibly his wife, came from behind and help comfort the still traumatized and trembling elderly woman leaving two youngest children with their teenage daughter. Lyca emitted a deep growl just seconds away from ripping the man apart. Caleb senses this and makes a gesture that he could handle. Mirabelle was afraid but tried her hardest not to panic; she wanted to be ready to help her Dear however she could."Goodness, what is happening her-?", came voice unknown to everyone. Turning to the source, their eyes widen in shock to the woman with angel wings standing beside one of the tables. Camilla's wrathful expression intensified when she and the angel locked eyes. Camilla's spread her bat-like wing's slightly showing her sharpened teeth while the angel spread her wings and glared at Camilla.Caleb, Mirabelle and Lyca exchanged quick questioning glances. The man backed away from Caleb dumbfounded."What...is this foul creature doing here? Don't tell me this a den of heathens?", The angel sneered."I say it was fairly pleasant until ju stepped in, self-righteous, callous shrew!", Camilla scoffed."You know her?", Caleb whispers back to Camilla." No, but filthy Angels are always the same.", Camilla hisses glaring daggers at the equally irate angel.Suddenly, the elderly Caucasian woman breaks away from her daughter-in-law, "Oh praise be to Jesus! I prayed, I asked God to protect us from the enemy and the Lord answered me. He sent one of his angels to move the devil out!", the old woman wept clinging to the Angel clothes. The angel woman stood confused and a little annoyed at old human geezer stretching out her blouse."You...you really answered my mama's prayers? You came down to help us?!", the man asked looking at her in amazement.The Angel blinked at him pondering the situation, "Uhhhh...yeah...Yes! I... have descended from on high with urgent commands from the Almighty to protect Miss... Miss...""Carpenter?", the man (whose last name is Carpenter apparently) asked."Carpenter! Miss Carpenter, yes.", the Angel answered hastily with a proud smile. Camilla rolled her eyes as Caleb gave her a skeptical glare, " I, Azaeli Lockhart, have to come protect and to vanquish the demon before you!"'Hehehe, not how I saw my day going, but after I have some fun wiping the floor with this Dorito eared slut, I can get these hee-haws to treat me a meal and maybe even do a bit of shopping for me', The angel thought with giggle."Come on and try ju loud-mouth, piss-haired Punta! I'll TEAR those chicken wings apart!", Camilla snarled moving past Caleb; her body surrounded in shimmering red aura and demonic eyes aglow. Azaeli the Angel spread her wings out with a gold aura enrapturing her body. got his mother and back away as she continued her godly praises. Mirabelle and Lyca shuddered not sure what to do.Caleb suddenly steps in between them, "ENOUGH! Nobody is tearing or 'vanquishing' anybody, you got that! Sir, instead of jumping to conclusions, just ask your mother what happened.""I don't need to ask! I see it with my own eyes, your fuckin' demon pushed her down!", The man shouted at Caleb glaring at him. Camilla and Azaeli shifted their back and forth from the human between to each other."And I say she didn't. Camilla was like 3 feet away from her when she fell.", Caleb stated."This harlot could've simply used her demon magic!", Azaeli pointed out to Caleb and rousing man in agreement."Oh really. I didn't see a seal. Camilla can only use her magic by first creating a seal.", Caleb retorted locking eyes with the Angel who glared at him contemptibly.'Who does this insect think he is?', Azaeli thought before replying, "Irrelevant, demons like her have all kinds of tricks! How are you sure she hasn't worked her wickedness on you my child?""What are you talking about now?", Caleb inquired becoming increasingly irritated by this girl making things worse."She's a Succubus is she not? How you sure you're being manipulated by her charm spells? Hers is a race stained in hedonistic sexual depravity; perhaps she's manipulating you another way.", Azaeli says with a small 'I got you now' smirk directed at Caleb. Camilla's eyes widened with rage while her aura surged more violently now changing to a reddish-black. Caleb jaw dropped as he struggled to find words of how shocked and angry he was right now. Then he noticed Camilla step passed him."Ju...JU Perra ángel sin refinar vil (vile, indignant angel bitch), I'll pluck off every feather and shove them down your lying throat!", She snarled in her demonic voice frightening the man and his family as well as several patrons. She created two black magic seals with red symbols pointing towards the angel. Azaeli smirks summoning four yellow magic seals; two near her palms, two on her wings. Caleb started feeling his heart race."DON'T TALK ABOUT CAMI AND CHIEF LIKE THAT! I'll kick the holy shit out of you!", Lyca snarled baring her fangs at the angel."T-That's right! You have no right to disrespect Ms. Sartana when you don't even KNOW her!", Mirabelle reprimanded.Azaeli scoffed at them, "Are you his homestays as well? Clearly, you've been brainwashed as well. Though I suppose it isn't THAT difficult to control more simple-minded creatures."Mirabelle and Lyca's jaw dropped clearly stunned and angered. Even Caleb could feel his blood boiling over, but he had to hold it together for all their sake. He then noticed a few of the patrons had their phones pointed at them. Lyca roughly pushed her chair aside and barks, "That's it!""LYCA STOP!", Caleb shouted throwing a hand towards her halting the She-wolf assault. Caleb then turn to Camilla grabbing her hand. The sudden feeling of someone touching her made her turn her burning demonic eyes towards the culprit."Let me go Se-", she started before he cut her off."NO, Camilla please stop! Don't give them anything else to use against you! We can just leave right now!", Caleb pleads as the intensity in her demonic eyes soften a bit as she stared back at his."Hmph, attacking a faithful servant of God and then attempting to flee when backed in a corner. You're not only a heathen, but a COWARD as well.", Azaeli chides them. Camilla, Lyca, and Mirabelle simultaneously felt her words sting them while Caleb paused a moment. It's been a long time since he's heard someone say that to him; he could already feel bad memories resurfacing."How dare ju?", Camilla uttered her aura surging. Caleb snapped out of it and quickly withdrew his hand feeling like it just stuck with several red-hot needles. Camilla's eyes emitted black flame-like wisps as she glared at the angel and spoke in her distorted voice, "How fucking dare ju?"Camilla charged up a black ball with pulsating red lightning as the Azaeli's magic seal began spinning rapidly with yellow diamond-like heads appearing in their centers. Mr. Carpenter hurried his mother and wife away to safety. Caleb looked back at Mirabelle as they struggled to find a way to stop this."WAIT!", called a familiar voice drawing the attention of everyone including the two warring liminals. It was the waitress from earlier, Cheryl, and standing next to her was a tall, tan-skinned in business casual with a name tag that had the restaurant logo above his name, 'Randy', "I told our manager the situation he has something to say."Manager Randy stepped forward, "Thank you, I just checked our security feed from our camera near the restrooms where your mother was supposedly pushed by this Demon. She in fact was NOT pushed but reacted in fear upon seeing the demon and made a misstep when backing away. This demon appeared to attempt to CALM her before she fell. You're welcome to see for yourselves."Caleb, Lyca, and Mirabelle looked at Manager Randy incredibly thankful for his action. Mr. Carpenter exchanged questioning stares between his wife and mother. Even Camilla stared at the waitress and manager stunned these humans she BARELY knows would bother getting involved on her behalf. She glanced at Caleb and the others then to Azaeli before thinking a moment. She sighed lowering her arms-dissipating the spell-as her hostile aura faded away much to Azaeli's surprise. Camilla moved back to her table still watching the angel closely. Azaeli scoffed refusing to be beaten."Oh, you humans put too much faith in technology. Obviously, this demon used her powers of corruption to alter what you saw on the video.", Azaeli stated matter-of-factly. Caleb and the girls gave her dubious looks. Mr. Carpenter and along with few other people in booths looked at her curiously."I didn't know they could do that.", Mr. Carpenter said."Yes, her kind are masters in all forms of trickery! Where do all this 'fake news' as you say comes from?", Azaeli stated as Mr. Carpenter and few others gazed at her in realization."That...that makes perfect sense!", a random guy stated."They're trying to control us all!", another random guy stated.Azaeli smirks to herself. Then Caleb walks up to her getting her attention."Excuse me, I'm a man of science so I'm gonna be the voice of reason. Even NOW I still have my reservations when it comes to magic; and I've see some fairy godmother type stuff on a regular basis. BUT if YOU expect me, or anyone not crazy to accept that 'magic creates hostile media' bullshit you're spitting, then YOU must be snorting some bad angel dust!", Caleb stated at her clearly having enough. Azaeli gasp at him with an irritated glare before calming down grinning at him."HEY! You can't talk to her like that! She's an angel sent by God himself!", Mr. Carpenter shouted outraged and was soon joined by several other men and women. Azaeli turns to them with a loving smile."It's ok children! This man is but a lost soul corrupted by the temptations of Lucifer and his followers. No worries, I shall defeat this Demon and 'purify' him along with those who side with him.", Azaeli says with an unhealthy grin before summoning a magic seal big enough to shield the entire front of her body. She directed it at Caleb's group as her new followers voiced their approval. Camilla prepared to go on the defensive as Lyca got into a lunging position. Cheryl and her Manager Randy ducked under the table in confusion and fear. Mirabelle went to Caleb's side clutching her hand to his. As Azaeli prepared her spell, her eyes locked with Caleb's and was surprised to see his eyes beginning to turn a bright shade of purple."ENOUGH!", came a new voice. Caleb, the girls, Azaeli and many of the patrons turned towards the restaurant entrance to see a rather short woman ( almost the size of a human child) dressed in mini black business suit with white collar shirt, black high heels, and wearing black sunglasses. As she did her 'boss ass bitch' walk towards them, they noticed the bushy lime green fur tail swaying with her movements and triangular, erect ears twitching. Caleb and girls instantly recognize her as Drei. Waitress Cheryl and Manager Randy poke their heads at the top of the table. She stops right between Azaeli and Caleb's group, "This has all gone on far enough!"'Where did this pint-sized pretty woman come from?", Azaeli thought before receding her magic seal and saying in a polite tone, "Oh, and who might you be miss?"" Agent Bao'ying, ICEP coordinator and MON special forces operative of Thailand ", Drei stated showing off her MON badge as Caleb turned to Mirabelle and the girls and shrugged at their questioning looks, "I was passing through the area when I heard some commotion from this d,establishment. So I decided to observe you for a few minutes. You seemed to be working out the issue on your own. Until now at least...", Drei finishes looking at Azaeli who recoiled a bit."Well...Ms. Bowling-""BAO'ying.", Drei corrected."Yes, BAO'ying, my apologies. You must understand that I was merely doing my job as an Angel of God and protecting the faithful.", Azaeli spoke in a kind tone."And you believe the best way to do that is by turning this restaurant, FULL of families and innocent bystanders, into a battleground?", Drei replied plainly.Azaeli tenses up defensively, "W-Well that's not...LOOK I wouldn't harm the faithful! I was merely protecting a follower after THAT heathen allowed his Succubus to attack her!", she stated pointing a finger at Caleb.Drei turns to Caleb's group pushing her glasses down exposing her eyes. Caleb and the girls were about to say something to her when she interrupted, "Is that so? From I understand, there's proof of that claim being false.", Drei winks at Caleb and girls hoping they get it. Caleb's eyes widen in realization."Y-Yes ma'am, that is correct.", said Manager Randy popping from his crouched position nonchalantly brushing his clothing off, "I can show you if that would help.""Certainly, I trust you have a laptop so others can view as well?", Drei inquired."Yes, ma'am. I can get it right now.", Manager Randy said about to leave for his office when Azaeli spoke up."Wait! There's no point in going through that! No matter what it shows, that demon corrupted the footage with her magic.", Azaeli stated becoming annoyed.Drei turns to her unflinchingly, "Oh? Do you have any proof of that claim?"Azaeli tenses again, "It's what her kind do! They're always manipulating people and media for their their own selfish gains!""So do lawyers, politicians, hackers, and your average social media troll. It still doesn't prove anything.", Drei stated plainly much to the angels chagrin."Are you...", Azaeli inhales sharply, calming herself but still quite irritated, "Ok, but since you're with ICEP, then you must arrest THAT heathen for having sexual relations with that beast!", Azaeli stated pointed an accusing finger at Caleb and Camilla respectively. Caleb had to hold Camilla and himself back from snapping at her deciding to let Drei handle this.Drei just gave her another plain glare, "Is that so? Do you have any proof of that as well? And kindly refrain from saying something along the lines of, 'It's what her kind do.' "Azaeli appeared to be at a loss for words at this point. Even some of her followers began murmuring behind her.'Fucking...who does this damn, fox-eared midget think she is?!', Azaeli thought starting to lose her patience, "Listen, I refuse to allow this dangerous Demon and her associates anywhere near honest, devout followers of our Lord. I demand they be cast out at once!"Drei tilts her head ponderously, "Hmm, I suppose it would be a risk to allow them to stay. Are you absolutely sure though?"' Of course I'm sure you stupid little bitch.', Azaeli thought before morphing to a more pleased expression, "I'm glad you understand, perhaps God has shown you the way. Now please, take them away."Drei nods then turn in the direction of front entrance, "Clear!"With that, a strong breeze blew into the restaurant disorienting several patrons before Ein appeared in a flash standing before them and surprising Azaeli and the patrons. Ein stood with a cold, stern demeanor."This is my partner, Agent Dashānquè.", Ein eyes widened a little then shot a glare at Drei, "Please escort this man and his homestays off the premises at once.", Drei requested much to Azaeli's confusion."Come along.", Ein stated hurrying them away from the table. She then got a little closer a whispered, "It's alright, just follow our lead and everything will be fine."Caleb and the girls simply nodded in understanding."Hold on a second! You're just letting them go?! What kind of agent are you?!", Azaeli inquired angrily."Who said anything letting them go? I'm just taking them in for questioning. There's the like", Drei answered as Ein began leading them to the exit. Caleb stopped, a thought occurring to him as he went back to the table grabbing the bags from Kami House."Wait a second, let me just pay for everything real quick. How much do I owe ya?", Caleb inquired Waitress Cheryl as her Manager watched her. She then took out her small tablet typed it in."Total would be 54.73, but you never got your desserts.", Cheryl stated feeling a little bad for them."It's fine, here, here's 55.", Caleb handed her the money then slipped her an extra 10, "A tip. Thank you, for everything. Food was fantastic." Cheryl grin for a second then looks at her Manager thoughtfully then back to Caleb's group.As Caleb the others were being led out, Camilla, Lyca, and Mirabelle exchanged one final glare at Azaeli. Drei then turn bowing slightly in a Wai position towards the Manager apologizing for the inconvenience. In the background, a few people could be heard complaining about lost phones.Azaeli glared at Drei furiously, "That's it?! After the chaos they caused, you just giving them a slap on the wrist?! That man AND his demon should be punished.""That man is a host for the cultural exchange. As such, he will be held accountable within our guidelines.", Drei stated walking up to Azaeli removing her glasses allowing her to see her stern, emotionless gaze, "But while we're on that subject, where exactly is your host family?"Azaeli pauses with a look of being caught, "U-uh...my host...yes umm...", she stutters her mind racing in panic before looking at the man and his family from earlier; an idea forming.She rushes to hug old lady Carpenter and her family, "Well I AM Ms. Carpenter's Angel. It's only natural I'd be here with them." The elderly woman happily hugged the Angel as Mr. Carpenter grinned along with a few other patrons chuckled at the display. Drei only looked on clearly not convinced in the slightest."She's with us, unless that's a problem with you Ms. Coordinator?", Mr. Carpenter says shooting an accusatory glare at Drei."No problem, merely a formality. You and family enjoy the rest of your day and I apologize for the inconvenience this evening.", Drei says before turning to leave.Azaeli's stomach growls audibly, "Ah, it appears I should've had lunch before leaving heaven.", she quipped inciting chuckling among Mr. Carpenter, his family, and a few patrons.As Drei was leaving, she glanced back at Azaeli who was busy being showered in affection and praise; but not too much to discretely give Drei an arrogantly triumphant grin. Drei wordlessly leaves the restaurant. Drei looked to her left to see Zwei sitting at a bench with a small pile of phones."And delete, and delete, and delete, and delete.", Zwei repeated typing on a phone in each hand. She finishes her task and says to Drei , "Evidence eliminated.""Good.", Drei replies."You think this'll be enough though? Info has a way of getting around.", Zwei inquired placing all the phones she confiscated into a shoebox near the restraunts entrance with a sign that said 'Lost Phones.'"No, but I believe we won't have to worry too much about that. People may talk but they still need proof.", Drei explains.Zwei stares at the restaurant pensively, "What about the Angel? Wouldn't it be best to deal with her now?""She hasn't done anything wrong, legally, it's out of our hands. Did you send the picture of her to Sterling?", Drei inquired."Yep.""Then we'll let him do a background and call it a day.""Alright, little sis, if you say so. Come on, I'm sure Ein's having a...hell of a time by now.", Zwei quipped.Drei gave a dry look, "No."..."De toda la estupidez, la mentira asenina que alguna vez he tenido el disgusto de aguantar( Of all the stupid, asenine bullshit I have ever had the displeasure of putting up with.), Camilla ranted furiously speed walking ahead as Caleb and the others followed behind her."Camilla! Camilla, come on slow down a minute.", Caleb pleaded jogging up beside her as bystanders began staring at them."Ms. Sartana, please it's ok!", Mirabelle pleaded trodding to the other side."No! It is NOT ok Señorita!", Camilla hissed at Mirabelle making her freeze in terror, "Everything about that was just...just...ARRGHH!", She yells slamming her fist against a nearby concrete wall leaving several impact waves and cracks. The bystanders watching them decided to keep walking. She then turns and walks to the entrance in a huff.Caleb runs up to catch her, "Camilla-", he taking her hand only for her to slap it away shooting him a stern glare."Don't touch me Señor! I didn't need ju to get involved!""Would you have preferred me sitting there eating while strangers denounce and vilify my friend?", Caleb replied incredulously."We can't just sir by while a family member is trouble.", Lyca added."I was fine; dealing with those humans was no issue for me.", Camilla spoke with a strained growl, "What I did expect was one of her kind to show up? Either way, I would've dealt with them all quckly.""And just HOW would you have dealt with them, Ms. Sartana?", Ein inquired stepping up and locking eyes with Camilla, "I certainly hope for your sake and your host's you weren't going to resort to violence. That would've made it worse for yourself, your host family, and your species!"Camilla gets up in Ein's face, "Ju really think it could get worse for me and mi pueblo? Races like ju have it so much easier. They see your fluffy ears and tail and call ju adorable! Uno look at me, and I'm a pariah, something to be cast out or destroyed according to their feeble doctrine. So, if I did choose violence, even in the service of defending mi own life, it wouldn't matter to them either way. They have, and always will, HATE us."Ein didn't relent crossing her arms and speaks in a serious tone, "Regardless of the circumstance, I would still carry out my duty. No matter who is in the wrong. Besides, if Drei hadn't informed us what was happening, things would've gotten very ugly and you along with Mr. Bizzell and Ms. Kessler and Marequine would've suffered greatly. Did you really want that weight on your shoulders?"Camilla glared at Ein in frustration from the realization she was right."M-Ms. Sartana, none of us were going to let them hurt you...but, at the same time, we didn't want you to become something we know you're not.", Mirabelle said walking up to her right side. Camilla gave Mirabelle an inquisitive look."You're a great friend Cami. No matter what any of those morons say, we love you no matter what.", Lyca stated appearing to her left side.Caleb appeared in front of her with a caring smile, "We aren't going to let a few backward-thinking, bible thumping dickheads ruin our day.", he says handing Camilla the bag with the light novel. Her intense expression softened considerably before taking it. Caleb smirked and continued, "By the way, is it me, or did that Angel bitch just LOVE the sound of her own voice? I mean just wah wah wahwahwah wah wah wah wahwah.", he said moving his hand like a mouth."Personally, I felt your 'Angel Dust' comment was quite spot on Dear.", Mirabelle adds with a giggle."Yeah and she smelled bad too! Like rotten deer meat covered in honey.", Lyca commented holding her nose in revulsion."Accurate.", Caleb and Mirabelle spoke simultaneously much to their surprise and amusement. Camilla smiled and giggled lightly at what they were doing for her."Excuse me! Coming though, excuse me!", Called the same familiar voice. The group turned to where it was coming from and were surprised to see Waitress Cheryl jogging towards them caring a white bag. She reached the group as Camilla's grin vanished, "H-Hello, sorry to bother you, but I wanted to give you your desserts.""Oh, wow um...thank you.", Caleb said taking the bag and opening it up to find four cheesecakes in triangular containers. Mirabelle and Lyca beamed happily thanking the waitress while Camilla watched her critically. Caleb then raises an eyebrow, "Wait, there's FOUR cakes here, I'm pretty I didn't order one.""It's on us. We didn't want you or your homestays leaving our restaurant without fully enjoying our food. You guys seem like nice people.", Cheryl stated humbly before shifting her gaze to Camilla. She wavered slightly meeting Camilla's intense red eyes but found her resolve to say, "U-um...Ms...Camilla? Was it?"Camilla gives a distrustful and unenthused look before cold speaking, "Si."Cheryl nods with a grin, "Right ok...I wanted to say...I'm sorry about what happened back there. I didn't want you to leave thinking THAT is what all humans are like. And for what it's worth, you guys are always welcome back here."The intensity in Camilla's eye began to melt away and was replaced by genuine interest. She didn't quite know how to respond until she noticed Caleb, Lyca and Mirabelle giving her supportive looks then turns the chestnut-haired human woman."Gracias...Señorita...but we may not be back too soon.", Camilla spoke."That's fine, completely understand, just...letting you know.", Cheryl says before a spark of realization hit her, "Oh, look at me still talking and I'm on my shift. Gotta go, bye!""Bye, thanks again!", "Thank you so much, goodbye.", Lyca and Mirabelle stated respectively. The waitress left the group to themselves. Caleb noticed Camilla watch her leave with a pensive look to her face.Suddenly, Ein's ears twitched feeling a small breeze accompanied by the voice of her sister, Zwei; it was her 'Voice of the Wing' ability."Mr. Bizzell, everyone, thank you for your cooperation, I will now return to surveying you from afar.", before any of them could say a word she disappeared with blinding speed."Huh, could've at least let me say 'thanks' back.", Caleb pouted a bit before turning to the girls with an emphatic grin, "So girls where would you like to go next? Do some more shopping? Maybe sight see?"The girls each exchange doubtful looks before Mirabelle spoke first, "Actually Dear, I think I've had enough Southern hospitality for one day.""Yeah, I second that." , Lyca said her ears furrowed like a sad puppy."Ninguna manera ( not a chance) Señor. I've seen enough for today.", Camilla replies plainly.Caleb's energetic facade quickly deflated, "Haaah thank goodness. Gonna be real with y'all, that bullshit back there drained me and I know it drained y'all too."Mirabelle smirks snarkily, "And you know what we say about bullshit, don't you Dear?"Caleb and the others gave surprise looks upon hearing Mirabelle cuss before giving each other understanding looks."All together now.", Caleb stated doing his gesture from earlier in the direction of the restaurant then the girls copied him."Ain't got time that!", they all stated in unison earning some curious stares from passersby which they couldn't care less about....They left the shopping district with minimal issue or disturbance outside the occasional rude stares and whispers from random pedestrians. They soon boarded the trolley and were on their way back home.Again, Mirabelle took a seat next to Caleb as Lyca hung close by watching the passing scenery and people boarding the trolley at each stop outside her window. Camilla sat on Caleb's other side getting an odd feeling of content. Caleb handed them each out a container with cheesecake with him saving his for later while they each enjoyed theirs but keeping the bag so they can discard their containers....'Ahhh, just a couple more turns and we can flip this day off and relax.', Caleb thought watching the streets becoming gradually more familiar. He looked around at the other passengers they've since picked up then to his wards. Lyca was talking with one of the passengers, a Kobold. They seemed to be comparing muscle mass and discussing workouts. To his right, Mirabelle rested her head against his shoulder simply enjoying the ambience of the surroundings. To his left, Camilla sat, her legs crossed, arms folded securely against her massive chest, with a pensive expression. Her cheesecake sat in it's container beside her hip, barely eaten. Caleb knew she had plenty on her mind but it still hurt to see her like this."H-Hey Cami-", Caleb started only to be interrupted when the trolley came to a screeching hault. The sound of loud angry chanting and screaming could be heard from the outside. Caleb exchanged confused glance between each of his girls as some of the passengers got up to look out the trolley windows. Police sirens could be heard among the noise and was accompanied by an officer speaking into a megaphone. Caleb stood up in his seat joined by Camilla, Lyca, and Mirabelle to see what was happening. He was shocked to see a large crowd of people blocking the streets."LOVE IS LOVE, SPECIES IS IRRELEVANT! LOVE IS LOVE, SPECIES IS IRRELEVANT!", chanted the group to the left. The protesters consisted of humans of different races and various liminal species chanting and holding up signs while some were in pairs holding hands.To the right, Caleb's eyes widened to see several men and women dressed in black military uniforms with red armbands with swastikas on their upper left arms. Then men's heads were shaved bald and some of them had black swastika tattoos on the sides. They carried signs depicting Nazi propaganda and rhetoric glorifying hate and xenophobia. The leader stood between two men-both carrying crimson red flags with a swastika in the center-wore a commander's hat and black cape and spoke in a megaphone."We are the National Socialist Party of America! We represent White America! The true and ONLY America! For the last 7 years, we have fought for the purity of this nation against the invasion of monsters, demons, and sub-humans! We are here today to protest and condem the Federal government for allowing INTERSPECIES marriage! This an insult to our pride as true human beings!"Caleb frowned in disgust before noticing Mirabelle's horrified expression. Camilla appeared just as disgusted as him while looked to him confused but irritated."Chief, who are those humans?", Lyca asked with a feeling repulsed."Nazis.", Mirabelle uttered before Caleb could answer."You know about them?", Caleb inquired surprised."My grandmother used to tell me stories about them. The horrible and evil things she along with members of our clan witnessed to the people of Poland.", Mirabelle says retreating behind Caleb."Who are they?", Lyca inquired."They're a hate group Lyca. They're a group of racist, intolerant people that see other races, especially humans that's aren't Caucasian, as inferior and undeserving of being called 'Americans'. There's several organizations like them all over the country.", Caleb explained as Lyca and Camilla wore expression of utter disgust."I don't like them. Who do they think they are?!", Lyca growled."Cómo revocador(how revolting)", Camilla hissed glaring at the group."Don't know what you said, but you said it.", Lyca agreed."Wait...what did they say about marria-", Caleb started but was interrupted by another louder megaphone chanting."WHITE POWER! WHITE POWER! WHITE POWER!"Caleb looked as his stomach sank and his blood began to boil as a group of people dressed in white robs with pointy hats a red marking in the chest joined the other racist group of protesters. A couple of them were dressed in all red or black symbolizing their higher positions. They carried banners and Confederate flags with designs representing white supremacy and few featured the words 'White Knights' on them."Now who the hell are they?", Lyca asked angrily.Caleb took a deep breath speaking through clenched teeth, "They...are the Ku klux klan Lyca sweetheart. They're one of the other hate groups I mentioned earlier.""We, the Appalachian White Knights Brotherhood are here today alongside our Aryan partners, to speak out against this abomination created by our government! Marriage is a sacred human tradition! How dare they allow these demons and animals try to pervert our way of life?! ", The klan member in black tiraded earning 'boos' from the counter-protestors, "These monsters never have and never will be welcome in this country! America belongs to humans! Pure blooded white Americans; no s**ks, no Jews, no f***ots, no Muslims, and ESPECIALLY no n***ers. Kick them out! Kick them out! Kick them out!"Suddenly, the trolley began moving again; right through the protesters. Dozens of riots control police officers surrounded the Nazis and Klan members separating them, the counter-protestors, and the trolley. Mon agents were on standby near the protesters on the left. As the trolley passes, the Nazis and Klan members shout racist comments and cursing at the people riding on board. Caleb could feel Mirabelle tighten her grip around his arms and trembling. Lyca was becoming more agitated by the second while Camilla sat trying to tune them out as she gripped the seats tightly.They heard a shriek from one of the passengers as the sound of glass breaking could be heard. The protesters had begun chucking rocks and other debris at the trolley. Caleb got Mirabelle to sit back down while he shielded her before Camilla put up a large blue magic seal to shield herself, Caleb, and Mirabelle. Lyca ducked and dodged the incoming projectile occasionally catching one and throwing it back."Lyca, get behind the barrier!", Caleb stated. Then, not paying close enough attention, a sharp piece of piece of gravel hits her in the forehead making her recoil in pain. Caleb jumped up to help her. She clutches her head before Caleb worriedly attends to her. Luckily, it didn't break the skin but she then turns to the protesters with a savage snarl. The riot police manage to break up the scuffle and led three Neo Nazis that started the pelting away in handcuffs."I'll TEAR you bastards apart!", Lyca shouted trying to lunge at the protestersf from one of the windows but Caleb managed to just barely pull her back."Lyca, stop! You can't!", Caleb grunted as she struggled in his grasp."No! Who are they to say I don't belong here?! I was BORN here dammit! And I'm not inferior! I'm not!", Lyca shouted."Señorita, control yourself!", Camilla stated creating a green magic seal. Green energy appeared around Lyca as her movements slowed while she struggled to move. Caleb now able to drag her back to the seat with her in his lap.He held trying to calm her, "It's ok, it's ok Lyca.""It's not right! They have no right to say those things!", Lyca shouted her voice cracking into a sob, "All my life I've been told I'm inferior. I leave to escape all that and now...", she stops struggling as tears roll down her eyes.Caleb pulls her trembling form into an embrace allowing her to sob into his chest."It's not...right. Chief, it isn't right.", Lyca whimpers as he strokes her head and back."I know, Lyca, I know.", Caleb whispers to her comfortingly while Mirabelle and Camilla came in closer to comfort her as well.They soon pass through the crowd back on route to their house. Lyca calmed down but remained close to Caleb which Mirabelle allowed and understood. Caleb wanted to say something to make them feel better but came up empty. The rest of the way home they sat in silence allowing themselves to digest what happened....Eventually they made it home and got off the trolley. Caleb disarmed the security locks and no soon as he did Camilla rushed inside followed by Lyca. Mirabelle lingered beside him wanting to say something but just wordlessly stepped inside." .."Caleb turned around to see the Zyklons. Ein and Zwei looked extremely worried while Drei had her usual dry expression but visible signs of concern."Hey...what's up?", he listlessly stated."Are...you all ok? I'm sorry you －Ein started but he interrupted."No! We'll be fine, I'll just talk to them.""What about Lyca?! Is she...", Zwei inquired with worrying eyes."I'll see about her too, trust me. Now please, today has been crazy and I'd like to relax a bit. Thank you all for everything today...I don't feel like cooking but here.", Caleb says taking out his wallet and giving them forty dollars, "Order yourselves some takeout."Ein took the money, "Thank you sir. B-but are you sure...?""Yes. Please, just let me handle this. Again, thank you so much, I'll see you tomorrow.", Caleb utters before stepping inside, closing the door, then arming the security system. The Zyklons stood outside exchanging troubled looks. Ein and Drei went next door as Zwei stared worriedly for extra minute before finally joining her sisters.…An hour passed since they returned. At first, Caleb let himself and the girls have their space to fully decompress after today's events. He lay down on the couch staring up at the ceiling in deep thought trying to figure out where everything went to shit. He thought of when that Angel called him a coward. His mind went back to…that day…the day his friends and family turned on him. The day he was marked for life; as a coward…and a murderer by everyone in his home town. Eventually, he realized he was falling back into old habits and decided he needed to stop being so pathetic and focus the girls who need him."D-Dear?", came the voice of Mirabelle. Caleb looked up to see her staring down at him leaning over the couch with worried purple eyes. He scooted up slightly to see, not only her, but Lyca standing behind her with a sorrowful but concerned demeanor. Mirabelle clutched her to her chest somberly, "H-How are you feeling?""Been better...but still ok, but I should be asking you guys that? With everything...that's happened today...", Caleb laments sitting up interlocking his arms resting elbows to his knees. Mirabelle adjusted the couch and glided her front legs over the cushions sitting next to him. She lay her hand on his back to comfort him, "But how are you girls? Lyca, how's your forehead?Lyca touched the bandage he had placed on her earlier, "I-It's a little better now. Thank you Chief.", she says falling silent with her ears flattening against her head."Like you said, w-we've been...better but still ok.", Mirabelle says, "L-Lyca and I were talking not long ago and we think we can move forward from this."Caleb smiled weakly at her and Lyca, "You girls are the best. I wanted today to be great for all of you. I'm...sorry you all had to go through all that today. Not just the restaurant, the protesters with the Neo Nazis and Klan members.", Caleb sighs tiredly, "I don't know...maybe you guys NEEDED to see that gahh...its so fuckin nuts.""N-no! Dear, today started out wonderfully. What happened at the restaurant and...those protesters...none of that was your fault.", Mirabelle says linking his arm to hers pushing herself into him gazing at him with trusting eyes."Mira's right chief!", Lyca stated plopping on the couch pressing herself against him with caring eyes, "A-And...I want to apologize for losing it on the trolley. I just...hated what those people were saying and I just...", she looks away despondently.Caleb lays a hand on head and started petting her much to her surprise, "I understand, truly I do, but I had to hold you back or you'd have be charged with assault. This country has laws that protect freedom of speech and if you attacked them when they were "peacefully" protesting, you would have been arrested and even deported from the state."Lyca hung her head wordlessly then nodded. He then lifted her head by the chin to look her in the amber eyes."But, if it was up to me and the law allowed it, I would've let you beat the mother loving crap out of them; hell I'd help.", Caleb says earning surprised looks from both of them. Lyca and Mirabelle then both grin at each other before giggling."Haha, that's our Chief!", Lyca stated her ears perking up and tails thumping against the couch before nuzzling her head to his shoulder."Indeed, bombastic and impetuous.", Mirabelle then lays her head to his shoulder and mushing her breasts to his arm, "A few of many reasons I love him so much."Caleb leans in to capture Mirabelle's lips to his. It last a few second before they pull apart blushing sheepishly while Lyca watched with interest."You know something stuck with me what those protesters said.", Caleb started as they looked with anticipation worried something they said got to him. He then took out his phone, "I did a little research a while ago, turns out it's true. They legalized marriage between humans and liminals."Mirabelle and Lyca stared at him then each other in surprise processing this startling revelation."So...yeah, that's a thing now, America's taking the next big step. How do you guys feel about it?""I think it's great, Chief.", Lyca stated happily."Y-y-yes, It's wonderful. I...I'm happy their allowing us...A-AND when I say 'us' I mean Liminals in general...n-not...um", Mirabelle stuttered blushing crimson red before poked her forehead."Go away weird thoughts. Moon pie it's nothing to stress over, it's not like that's going to directly affect us any time soon.""Y-Yes, of course haha, I guess my mind started to…wonder again. ", Mirabelle utter sheepishly, "We should tell Ms. Sar-I mean, Camilla the news as well."Suddenly it dawns on him; he hasn't seen much since they got home."Wait, where is Camilla? Is she in her room?"Both girls push off of him with thoughtful and concerned expressions."Cami has been in the backyard for a while. We tried talking with her...but...", Lyca answered her demeanor changing back to a more uneasy. Mirabelle gave a disillusioned expression worried she was going to lose her friend.Caleb went silent before sighing, "Ok. You say she's on the back right?", he then rises to his feet as they release him."Yeah, she's up on the roof.", Lyca said"Ah ok, good to-what the hell did you just say?", Caleb uttered what she said truly registering"S-She's on the roof Chief. She's been sitting there staring at the sky for awhile.", Lyca answered.Caleb decided it was better to just roll with it, "Alright then.""What are you going to do?", Mirabelle inquired."Not much else TO do but try and get her to talk. While I'm doing that, you guys can relax, you deserve it. Meanwhile, I'm going to see if that ladder is still near the storage cellar.", Caleb stated before walking out through the glass sliding doors; feeling the extra weight on it since it was now bullet proof.Mirabelle and Lyca exchanged worried looks before deciding to put their trust in him."Lyca, we could play Xenoverse 2...if you want."Lyca beams at her, "Sure Mira! Hey, but can I ask you something?""Of course. What is it?", Mirabelle grins."What's marriage?""E-eh?!", Mirabelle pause...Caleb stood outside. The sun had just about set on the horizon painting the sky a beautiful but ominous cascade of orangish-purple nimbus clouds. Caleb looked around the backyard taking in how much his changed in the past two months. Before Mirabelle, it was totally barren with only the grass that had browned in several spots from overuse of pesticides from the previous tenants. Now, it was a thriving green lawn with a large, colorful garden of flowers and herbs and even recently purchased patio furniture with purple parasol. He backs up further from the house to get a better look at the roof. Scanning it, his eyes eventually landed on the winged silhouette on the far left of his house. He nodded to himself then sneakily went to get the ladder....Camilla stared up at the evening sky-her wings spread out for balance-with an apprehensive expression."Mamá, qué estoy haciendo? Por qué me hago esto a mí mismo? Nunca pensé que mi vida tomaría este tipo de giro. Por favor, no sé qué hacer ...(Mama, what am I doing? Why do I do this to myself? I never thought my life would take this kind of turn. Please, I don't know what to do...)", she uttered to herself sadly.Then a loud metallic clank caught her attention. She saw two metal prongs appears at the edge of the ceiling. She narrowed her eyes readying herself for possible attack. "Who is there?", she inquires."It's-a me, Caleb B.", Caleb stated in a bad Italian accent appearing over the roof while carefully getting his footing."Oh...Señor, it's only ju.", Camilla uttered going back to her relaxed state."Heh, not quite the reaction I was hoping for.", Caleb said walking over and sitting next to her, "Though I guess that's to be expected.""What do ju want Señor? I am not in the mood for games.", Camilla stated clearly unenthused."I just want to talk. We NEED to talk about what happened today Camilla. I'm not getting off this roof until we do.", Caleb stated kindly but firmly.Camilla's cheeks flushed a bit as she went quiet for a moment then sighing, "Fine. Where should we begin?""How about that crazy Angel lady? What was her problem? She just strolls, starts talkin down to us, then tries to attack us. All the while, making everything worse with those people accusing you. Then these racist protesters show up right the hell out of nowhere.", Caleb stated as Camilla listened but showed no sign of being engaged."Ju talk as if none of that is to be expected.", Camilla plainly stated earning a surprised look from Caleb, "Her kind are callous and self-entitled control freaks that believe the world should bend over backwards for them. It's likely that she intended to kill me upon seeing me and only used those human's collective anger as an excuse."Caleb jaw dropped, "Holy hell, she really would've gone that far?!""Si, ju saw for yourself. In fact, I could tell from the intensity of her mana the spell she was going to use against us was powerful enough to kill almost everyone in the restauranté.", Camilla explained to Caleb's shock."Bitch is crazy. Then ya got those crucifix crazy assholes practically kissing the ground she walks on. Jesus, I feel like humanity just took a substantial step back several hundred years.", Caleb laments shaking his head in embarassment."Again, it's nothing new Señor. I would have killed that filthy Angel without much trouble.", Camilla says making Caleb paused in shock before she continued, "It's just the way it's always been."Caleb takes a moment to process what she said, "Camilla, why...why do Angels and Devils hate each other that much?"Camilla looks up at the now dark blue evening sky, "Our races have a long and bloody history stemming from the creators of this world: The progenitor of Discord and the progenitor of Order. Mi Gente (people) follow it's teaching of true freedom through disorder and chaos. The Angels believe the opposite and have instigated attacks in attempts to cleanse the world of our so-called 'evil'. At first we had the upper hand in numbers but soon they developed means of suppressing and negating our powers. They nearly wiped us out and even ensured those of us who survived couldn't create a legacy."Caleb listened intently unsure what to think of all this, "Wow, I...I didn't know it was like...that.""Figures, ju humans deeply trust in your doctrines that tell ju 'Angels good, Devils bad.' ", Camilla sarcastically stated."Well, I wouldn't say that. I'm not a very religious guy, even though my Uncle tries getting me to go to church. I just never took to it much.", Caleb replies earning an intrigued look from her, " But lemme tell ya, the way that bitch disrespected me, my friends, AND my girlfriend...no, no heavenly servant of God my ass!"Camilla stared at him in wonder before saying, "Ju are certainly one to speak your mind Señor. Even towards the humans who see me as an abomination. Even towards that Angel ju still told her off even though she could easily killed ju.""I WAS scared Camilla, don't get me wrong. But, I wasn't just going to sit back while she says those awful things about you. She doesn't even know how great a woman you are. It doesn't matter what some church going folk or Michael's bitch says, I still like you.", Caleb says in a caring tone.Camilla blushes feeling her heart pound furiously before smiling happily, "Ju are either the single craziest or dumbest man I've ever met Señor.""Maybe, but I at least know what's right.", Caleb says with a smirk.Camilla grin fades looking downwards pensively, "Gracias Señor, for trying to protect me. N-No one...but mi Madre has ever been that nice to me. I am so sorry ju had to see that side of me again.""No, I mean...yeah you did lose control of your anger but who hasn't done that in their life? I'm sorry you and girls had to be exposed to so much bigotry today.", Caleb says crossing his arms."It's ok Señor, I've experienced worse than just accusations and name-calling.", Camilla reassures."No it's not! This is a country built on the concept of opportunity and change. You and the girls deserve a chance at a better life; regardless of your past. There's nothing wrong with any of you; as far as I can see at least.", Caleb gently finished locking eyes with Camilla as she felt her heart melt at his unremitting kindness.Camilla wipes a tear from her eye then scoots closer, "I am so happy I met you that night Señor.", her shoulder presses against him as she lay her hand to his. Caleb tensed up beginning to feel uneasy."C-Camilla...", he uttered wanting to back away yet something deep inside kept him from doing that."Señor...I want ju to know I have not given up mi feelings for ju. I believe ju truly are mi Destino, my heart and body reacts whenever ju are near and it's only gotten stronger these last few days. I've tried mi best to suppress it but...", Camilla trails glancing away before interlocking her fingers to his, "When ju speak to me like just now, I feel...safe. Appreciated. Loved. Even if ju don't believe in destiny, even if ju love someone else, even if I don't know enough about ju, I can't just forget about ju. I love ju, Señor. I really do."Caleb went silent not sure what to say to her proclamation. He knows he loves Mirabelle, he made that clear to everyone, but even then she's STILL not giving up on him. Why? How is he worth that trouble? He hasn't done anything that any decent person could've done. So why him?"That is why...", she continues in a soft tone as Caleb flinched from her tail snaking around his waist, "I ask that ju please let me in, even if it's only a little."Caleb wordlessly stared back at her trying to take in her request. Her pleading crimson red eyes showing her needy almost desperate wish. He suddenly felt her body tremble a little then quickly try to suppress it. She was trying her hardest to be strong no matter what his answer. Caleb closed his eyes in thought as Camilla watched with anticipation."How…little? What do you want me to do?", He spoke with uncertainty. Camilla perks up with hopeful eyes."If it is ok with ju Senor, I-I want ju to... hold me. T-that is all I wish, nothing more.", Camilla said hugging her chest slightly pushing up her breasts. Caleb gulps averting his gaze before inhaling."Alright, but that's it.", Caleb says with serious eyes.Camilla nods, "I understand Senor."Her wings fold into her back as Caleb reluctantly extends his arm over her head resting it on her shoulder pulling her close. She moved closer tightening her tail on his waist. Caleb blushed feeling thighs pressed against his and the side of her breast glide against the upper side of his chest. He internally shouted at himself that it was just a hug...JUST a hug. She keeps her hands in lap then rests her head on his shoulder; her dark blue horns feeling oddly smooth against his neck. They shifted a bit until finally finding a position they both found comfortable."I-is this…good?", Caleb inquires nervously.She sighs blissfully closing her eyes, "Si, it is perfect, Senor."Caleb was relieved by her response. He decided it would be wise to stay in that position just until she was satisfied."Muchos gracias, Senor.", Camilla coos as her heated breath hits his neck sending chills down his spine. It was then Caleb, for the first time, takes a really good look at her. The loving warmth that radiated from her body, her tail wrapped possessively around him, the way the starlight reflected off her silky, brown hair, the sweetness in her voice, about her was...beautiful.Caleb paused in shock at that notion. Did he really think that? It's true, he knew she WAS beautiful, objectively speaking. However, the more he analyzed it, he realized there were feelings emerging more than just from fondness or the gratitude he felt for saving his life. Her personality, the time he spent so far getting to know her, her weird quirks and abilities, he appreciated everything about her. Even now, embracing her like this...he was actually enjoying it; much more than he should. It felt...right. Was he...attracted to her? Did he have feelings for her?!'What...what am I doing? Why...", He thought anguishing over developing romantic feelings for any other woman but his Moon pie. What was wrong with him? How could he betray her like this?"Mmmm, Señor, that feels good.", Camilla uttered under her breath nuzzling him while pressing herself more into him. He suddenly realized he was unconsciously stroking and massaging her scalp. A part of him wanted to stop...but...the sensation as he combed her brown locks and smooth horns was too pleasant. He cast his gaze downwards in shame.'You piece of shit. Goddamit...', he thought sorrowfully cursing himself.... Elsewhere...In a large cemetery located downtown, a winged figure stood atop the roof of a grave house. Her white wings partially visible by the light of quarter moon. It was Azalee."Haaaahhh, such a lovely evening. I suppose that's one thing this place has going for it; well, that, and the foods pretty good. Hehe, not to mention the humans, like the bald bozo and his mee-maw will jump when I twitch my wings.", Azaeli haughty smirk quickly leaves replaced by a disgusted grimace, "Tch, then we that human from restaurant and his damn devil pet trying to ruin my lunch. Then that short bitch tries making a fool out of me? The great Azaeli? I swear, if I EVER see any of them again..."Suddenly, a cellphone rings breaking her out of here monologue. She pulls out a burner flip phone and looks at the number instantly recognizing it and rolling her eyes, "Ugh, what does he want?"She presses answer, "Hey, Nikolai, it's been a while.", She says in a more chipper tone."Dobryy vecher, are you alone?""I'm in a cemetery at night, how much more alone can I get?", Azaeli replied, "What is it? You in the market for more enslavement collars or perhaps some enchanted ammunition?""No, not at this time?"Azaeli sighs, "Shame, you Malones are my best customers. I haven't had much business lately since ICEP started tripling down after that motel incident so I'm in a really tight spot money wise.""Da, our profits have taken a terrible hit, but What is worse...my nephew...our Jakob is going to be executed tomorrow.", he says with a choked sob, "Even Fantina couldn't save him. Damn those ICEP swine!""Sorry to hear, that totally sucks.", Azaeli stated feigning concern, "But...if you didn't call to do business, what DO you want?""I have a personal request, even Mama Rosé does not know yet. There is a man named Caleb Bissell. He is responsible for all of this. I want him gone from this earth. I will pay double your regular compensation.", he stated trying to control his anger."D-Double?! Really?!", Azaeli stated emphatically, "Consider it done, but you know I'm gonna need a down payment.""Already taken care of. Go to the Maggie Meyers pub, there's an acquaintance of mine waiting there."Azaeli grins, "Hehe, consider it done.""Perfect. I expect his head on a plate.", Nikolai says before hanging up.Azaeli puts her phone away with an unsettling chuckle, "Welp, goodbye empty money trouble, hello nights at Hilton Inn.", Azaeli gave wicked grin as her snow-white wings changed to a midnight black, "and...goodbye one Caleb Bissell."WNHa! I know, long chapter? What's good fam, I'm sure you missed me this last month but I've been occupied with working my ass off to pay my classes, because I refuse to ADD to nationwide student loan debt! In case you couldn't tell, this chapter marks the end of season 1 of the story. Thank you everyone for sticking with me this long. Special thanks to Sandshrew master and DRAGONDAVE45 for helping me whenever writers block hit.I actually have another announcement. Guess who's got a P/ TR3ON?! Me!

A consistent 1 chapter every 2 weeks is what I'm aiming for.Those who pledge get access to exclusive bonus fluff chapters and lemony scenes that are actually canon to the main story. Don't worry, there will still be lemon scenes in the main story but they'll mostly serve to drive the plot in a way. THESE are lemons for those who enjoy lemonade; and I LOVE lemonade. Don't worry, I'm not gonna ask anyone to break the bank. Any support is more than appreciated and even if you don't pledge, I'm just grateful for you reading my stories at all. Without you, I'd be nuthin'! Thank you!That's all for now, see you soon. Peace Fam!P.S.For those of you wondering, the alias that Drei used, 'Boa'ying', is actually a shortening the Chinese phrase Bao'ying shu meaning "Your comeuppance." Also, Ein's alias, 'Dashānque', that Drei chose is a portmanteau of 'Dashā inque meaning 'Big tits'; which explains her annoyed reaction. You guys can thank my bud Li Jei for that.
  
    Chapter Text
    Chapter 18: The ProposalCaleb Bizzell lay in his bed staring up at the ceiling in deep rumination over the events that have transpired up until now.After the time he spent on the roof of his house with Camilla, they eventually went down to join the others and Caleb started on making dinner. The dinner itself was relatively small and took hardly any time; mainly due to Camilla insisting on helping which Caleb was reluctant and a little apprehensive to allow. The entire time cooking with her he felt uneasy. Despite her noticeably keeping a respectable distance he would occasionally catch her staring at him then quickly look away when he made eye contact. It wasn't much better at the dinner table. Moon pie seated next to him and Camilla seated DIRECTLY in front of him. Not as awkward as the group full moon shaming/forgiveness session a few days ago but still an uncomfortable experience. It only got worse when Mirabelle started a conversation about the Interspecies Marriage thing.**Flashback**"Q-Qué dijiste (what did you say?)", Camilla stated dropping her fork in shock."Y-Yes, a-apparently they've legalized m-marriage between humans and liminals in this country.", Mirabelle uttered her cheeks flushed pink before nervously turning to Caleb, "B-but Dear knows a bit more about it than me!"Caleb pauses as Camilla focuses her now awestruck, expectant gaze on him before averting his eyes to his plate, "Not really. I only know what I've read on it so far. Apparently, Congress decided to pass it as an alternative to normal integration and eventual citizenship without needing to pass that weird exam. Almost every species, except vampires and dragons for now, are eligible for it so long as both party's agree to it. Frankly, it kinda sounds like a more watered down affirmative action if you ask me.""What's affirmative action?", Lyca uttered her mouth full of meat tilting her head curiously."Think of it like, if a group of people treated your people unfairly in the past and now they're saying sorry by over-compensatingly giving you what they THINK you want but don't actually need.",Caleb explained.Lyca swallows, "Ohhh I think I understand now. Still I think it's great humans and liminals can settle down with their chosen mates.", she beams at Caleb tail thumping against the chairas Mirabelle quietly stirred her vegetarian soup pensively.Caleb grins at Lyca, "Heh, I'm glad. I'm kinda surprised you understand how marriage works.""Mira told me that's how human marriages works.", Lyca said making Mirabelle flinch with a startled expression."Really?", Caleb says giving her a sly look."W-well...that's um...I-I just happen...to know...a-about it...a little.", Mirabelle stuttered blushing furiously and shifting her gaze away. Caleb lightly chuckled at her timidness. He then noticed Camilla pondering to herself with a perplexed demeanor. She momentarily gazes at him with a longing expression before quickly turning away as when she and him made eye contact. Caleb felt an uncomfortable knot in his stomach the rest of dinner.***Flashback over***"Haaaahhhh, what the hell is wrong with me?", Caleb groaned smothering his face with his pillow then tossing it away somewhere. He couldn't stop thinking about what happened on the roof with Camilla.Caleb grips his forehead staring up at the darkness and thought, 'This is crazy. Yeah, she's beautiful, any man with common sense would say the same. There's no way I'm attracted to her the same way as Moon pie! Am I?"Then he remembered when he held her; how right it felt having her pressed against him. He hated it, he hated himself for feeling this way.'Dammit...', he thought angrily shifting around in bed then punching the nearby wall. He settled in for what was to be a rough night's sleep....~DreamMasterz~Caleb exhaled as a deep coldness ran through his entire body accompanied by the feeling of lots of weight pressing on every inch of his body. He began moving his arms and legs only to feel his movements being restricted by some kind of viscous fluid. His eyes fluttered open and he stared ahead at the deep dark blue surroundings."Where am-", he started only to be surprised to see bubbles form in front of him. His eye shot open before quickly looking around with every movement impeded by the volume of liquid, "Ahhhh, somebody help me-wait...I can breath?", he questioned realizing he's somehow breathing just fine despite being underwater."Dear? Are you alright?", came the voice of Mirabelle. He looked around unsure of where her was coming from. Suddenly, the water around his began moving around him in a strong circular current until all the water around him was stripped away. He found himself sitting on his rear before his eyes focused on Mirabelle sitting next to him with a concerned look on her face. A circular wall of water rotated around them as Caleb look up at the sky shrouded in purple mist."Oh, Moon pie, so it is a dream. Weird, I don't even remember falling asleep or creating any of this.", Caleb said before he felt her hands clasp his before meeting her worried gaze."You were already dreaming when I entered your mind. You were drowning, looked like you were in pain, so I helped you and tried my best keeping you calm and relaxed.", Mirabelle explained as tears welled in her eyes, "I was scared…you…you…"Caleb cups both sides of her face,", Hey, hey hey hey, Moon pie, It's alright. I'm alright, I just…had a lot on my mind. I'm not going anywhere.", he softly speaks wiping her tears away. Mirabelle sniffles a little and nuzzled her cheek into his hand before looking at him."D-dear…please, tell me what's wrong. I'm your girlfriend, I'm here for you. We're safe here.", Mirabelle said intently staring at him. Caleb opened his mouth but said nothing instead letting her words sink in before turning to her with an small sweet grin."Ok, Moon pie.", he spoke softly before standing up, "but first, get a bit more comfortable."Caleb extended his arms as the mark on his chest glowing a bright purple and the ground around them rose up and expanded while transforming into course sand. A small, lush tropical forest of ferns, exotic plants, healthy green grass, and palm trees sprouted from below them providing shade. Sunlight shown down through the purple mist above them bathing them in warmth. The saltiness of the ocean and sweet aroma of tropical plants quickly filled the area.Caleb puts his arms down exhaling before plopping back down next to Mirabelle who was busy admiring the beautiful environment, "Just so you know, I don't know what many tropical plants really smell like but I DO know what glade tropical fresh plugins smell like."Mirabelle raised an eyebrow before lightly giggling. She then turns to a more serious and thoughtful expressions then focused on him, "Caleb, are...are you still feeling guilty about what happened at the restaurant and with those protesters?""...No. More or less, I'm kinda over that. Really, I was more worried how you guys felt about all that. But, it looks like you're all doing ok. That's all that really matters." , Caleb said earning a deep frown from Mirabelle, "What's wrong?""Dear, you matter too. Please, I know you care about me and the others, but don't forget about yourself. I love you and don't want to see you hurting either.", Mirabelle replies earning a surprised look from Caleb.Caleb thought for a second knowing it'd come out eventually; best she know now, "T-there's something else...on my mind actually. Remember...when I went to check on Camilla earlier.""Yes?", Mirabelle inquired a bit confused but attentive, "D-did...something happen?""No...not...exactly. It started out with us talking; she explained a little of why Angels and Devils hate each other and she seemed to be feeling better...then...", Caleb pauses unsure if he could really do it.Mirabelle takes his hand sweetly, "Then? Dear, it's ok."Caleb looks into her loving purple orbs and inhales, "I...she then...told me she still believes I'm her 'Destined One'. T-That...she was still in love with me and...probably continue to do so even if you and I are couple; she'll still keep her distance though out of respect."Mirabelle's eyes had widened in shock and she went silent in thought. The world around them glitches for a few second startling Caleb."M-moon pie?!", Caleb stated breaking her out of her trance."O-oh! S-sorry I...I just felt a surge of wild emotions for a moment, I'm sorry. But...I have to be honest, I could tell, ever since earlier today, she still felt...something for you. I noticed she tried giving us our space, as you said, and...she seemed to genuinely enjoy being with us. I wanted to trust her...but I still decided to keep an eye on her.", Mirabelle explained picking up sand allowing it to pour through her fingers."T-there's more.", Caleb uttered nervously before she turned to him worriedly, "she...also said that...even if she couldn't have the same relationship as us...she wanted me to show her a little affection. She asked me to hold her...and...I did. But THAT'S all I did...that's all I WOULD do and she accepted that. Still, I feel ashamed for doing it."Mirabelle went silent closing her eyes again thinking to herself and calming down; if she loses control of her emotions who knows what damage she could do to his subconscious. She eventually opened her eyes giving him a serious look, "Caleb, I'm glad you told me. Truth is, I am a little angry about that and it DOES make me wonder if I can trust Ms. Sartana around you now. At the same time, I...understand how she feels quite a bit. She's suffered most of her life, much longer than me, at the hands of humans and liminals alike. She just wants to desperately hold on to her happiness she's found. She'll do anything, accept anything, as long as she feels safe and loved. I was the same and still am in some aspects.""Moon pie...i'm sorry I-", Caleb uttered but was interrupted."It's ok. Listen, I said I was only a little angry. Camilla IS, in her own way, respecting our relationship by putting necessary boundaries between you and her. I know you love me but I'm also aware you care about all of us and would do anything to help us. I...I'm ok with you showing a little affection to Camilla...if it means it helps her adjust. I-I know you won't let her do anything else, I trust you my love.", Mirabelle finished squeezing hand assuredly. Caleb was stunned by how accepting she was being. It touched his heart to see how much she's changed since she first came into his life. However, a part of him was still uneasy."Are you sure...Moon pie? Is that really the only solution? There has to be a better way for Camilla to get what she needs without putting a strain on yours and mine relationship.", Caleb says."I don't know. It's not like it's possible for you to date both of us at the same time or anything. I'm not even sure how I'd feel about that.", she replies."Yeah no, that'd be ridiculous not to mention stupid. I love YOU and only you. Sigh, I guess the best option I have is to do what you said and show her a little affection time and again. Hopefully, that truly will be enough for her.", Caleb says in an uncertain tone."We can only hope Dear but no matter what I'll be there to help you if you stumble.", Mirabelle says reassuringly patting his hand."Thank you, Moon pie.", Caleb said feeling a bit more relaxed."Of course, my love.", Mirabelle said before interlocking her fingers as he lovingly did the same. Suddenly, a thought occurred to him."Hey, Moon pie, remember earlier at dinner when we were talking about the Interspecies Marriage plan?", Caleb inquired.Mirabelle tenses up as she became flustered, "Y-y-yes, w-why do ask?", she says looking at him expectantly."That's why.", Caleb said booping her nose, "why ya so nervous babe, it's not that big a deal. I understand how you must feel, I'm also happy that our relationship CAN be legal. But WE don't need to rush into something as serious as marriage right now. We humans tend to take out time really getting to know someone before accepting that level of commitment."Mirabelle blushed looking away still a bit embarrassed, "I know...""Yeah, there we go, and it's not like this new law is going to have THAT much influence on our lives any time soon.", Caleb said lifting her head up.Mirabelle looks at him bashfully, "Y-yes...Dear...you're right...I was merely getting ahead of myself.""It's ok, just as long as you know that. Besides...", Caleb trails before sensually tracing along her back. She gasps giving him a longing but surprised look before he continues, "being all sneaky like this, keeping our relationship a secret outside of Camilla and the others, it's...actually kinda hot.""W-W-What are you saying so suddenly?!", Mirabelle stated her face flushing red as she tried to hide her embarrassed grin.Caleb smirks knowingly, "Exactly what I meant. Can you tell me you don't feel a little excited doing something bad and not getting caught?", he says nibbling and pecking her neck sending jolts down her spine, "Especially...when it's somewhere nobody can disturb us."She gasps when he cups the side of her left breast caressing from her underboob then tracing along her chest with one finger."I-I Haahhhh...oooohhhhaahhh...", Mirabelle moans as her breathing becomes ragged while he continues peppering her in attention. She reaches her hands to wrap him in her arms but, to her confusion, he pulls away standing up."But, first thing's first, gotta get into tonight's theme.", Caleb stated in a cheeky tone. The mark on his chest glows before he snaps his finger and his cloths change from t-shirt and boxers to green swim trunks, "meet ya in water woopwoopwoopwoopwoop!", he utters before comically sprinting off leaving Mirabelle in a daze.Mirabelle puffs her cheeks in irritation, "Gets me in the mood then just scadaddles? I think not.", she says as her body radiates purple aura then she disappears in a flash.Caleb chuckles arrives near the shoreline. The takes note of the sensation of wet sand and cool waves against his feet before walking into water until he was waist deep. It all felt so real he could hardly believe it was all essentially smoke and mirrors. He's really gotten better at manipulating this world. He frowned slightly in disappointment in himself at not telling Mirabelle...everything. What would she say? How could that affect hers and Camilla's recent friendship? He couldn't sacrifice that kind of progress on his uncertainty. He decides to truly examine those feelings for Camilla on his own. For now, he'll keep them hidden from Mirabelle; in the real world and the dreamscape.He looks behind him to where he left her to find she was gone. He scanned the eyeland to find any sign of her before calling out, "Moon pie!".No answer."Moon pie?! Where'd ja gyahhhoo", Caleb exclaimed as his body tenses suddenly. He quickly turned his head to be greeted by Mirabelle's brazen expression as she clutched his butt cheek tightly."Tsk tsk tsk, you really thought I'd let that slide Dear?", Mirabelle chided gripping a bit tighter making him squirm. She gets close enough so her hot breath hits his ear, "Now it's your turn to be teased.", she finishes taking his earlobe in her mouth and pressing her smooth skin against him.Caleb shuddered as her soft, warm mounds glide up and down his back and sucked his ear like it was her personal toy. He then felt her hand run across his stomach before slipping into his trunks. This sent him over the edge; he wanted her right now. He tore away from her grasp, to her shock and worry, and his eyes widened at her sudden choice of attire. A purple string bikini top that barely contained her large mounds and, as far he could tell, nothing on her lower half."Dammit you are sexy.", Caleb stated in amazement.Mirabelle smiles cupping her beet red cheeks happily swaying, "~Oh, Dear, you're always say the most shameless things.~"Caleb grabs both her shoulders giving her a loving stare, "Why would I be ashamed of the truth?"Her eyes widened becoming glazed in desire as Caleb pulls her close. Their lips smashed into each other in heated passion as they wrestled dominance. The sloppy, wet sounds of their increasingly excited make-out session began filling their ears. Mirabelle moaned adoringly rubbing and caressing his arm, pectoral and ab muscles. Then her hands wandered to Caleb's butt and began fondling it; Caleb was quickly learning that was her favorite part of him to touch. They released to take their breath and Caleb peppered her neck and collar bone in kisses eliciting breathy content sighs. He makes his way to her breasts and began nibbling her flesh. She shudders when pushes her bikini up expose the cherry red tips before taking her in his mouth."HAAAAHHH!", Mirabelle gasps throwing her head back in delight as he sucks on her sweet, creamy flesh while he vigorously massaged her other breast. His tongue lapped and circled around the little red nub eliciting louder moans, "AAHHAA ohhh Gods...Hahhh...n-not so rough Dear...ahhhh but...but it feels so good!"As he was enjoying the taste of his girlfriend, he found himself thinking back to the full moon night when...he and Camilla were on the couch...and...Caleb's eyes shot wide in horror before he released Mirabelle's breast with a loud pop allowing her to catch her breath."Haa..Haa...w-w-why'd you stop?", Mirabelle utters confused why he suddenly stopped pleasuring her. Caleb snaps out of it facing her while trying to hide fear."Hehehe you said I was being rough. Are you trying to say you like it rough?", Caleb raises an eyebrow distracting her from inquiring further."E-Ehhh?! W-w-well what y-you were doing was...I mean i-it felt so good but I...u-uhhh..." , Mirabelle stutters before he silences her with a kiss. She melts into it snaking her arms around his neck.He pulls back and beams at her, "It's ok baby, everybody's got a kink and yours is pretty tame compared to most shit on the internet. Seriously, NEVER google 'unbirthing' I wish to protect the rest of your purity."She comedically blinks before grin forms, "You always know the oddest things to put me at ease.", Her eyes fill with lust and smile becomes more lascivious, "hehe, I don't really think it's fair I'm the only one receiving pleasure Dear.", she says massaging the rather large bulge in his trunks making him shudder."Well ack...how about we change that? And maybe add some mood music.", Caleb's mark glows before he snaps his fingers and a smooth baseline blues track starts playing accompanied by rhythmic drum beats. Even the sun changed into a soft purple shining giving the area a beautifully romantic nuance.Suddenly, small purple clouds begin forming in the image of a ostentatiously well-dressed middle-aged African-American man holding a microphone and singing with a deep, smoothest, blackest voice ever, '~My darling I, can't get enough of your love baby. Girl, I don't know, I don't know why, I can't get enough of you love, baby.~'Mirabelle takes in the atmosphere fully appreciating the amount of effort he's putting in for her. She turns to him with adoring gaze before he made a 'wait for it' gesture. He snaps his fingers, his trunks disappear, the water around them parts like the Red Sea, and out springs his foot long erection that reached up to his stomach."GAHH!", Mirabelle shrieks covering her mouth, "D-Dear...y-y-your...how in-...why so-...long!""This is a dream Moon pie. Of course I'm use it to my FULLEST potential. If you want I could make it bigger-""NO!", Mirabelle stated unable to avert her eyes, "I mean, no, just...make it normal size...please?"Caleb rolls his eyes before his erection shrinks to its normal real world size, "better?""Much better?", Mirabelle says before plopping down in front of his member then taking it in hand stroking him base to tip as shivers ran through his body. She looks up at him with a lustful wink, "I happen to prefer THIS just fine."She licks his member covering the entire length in glistening hot saliva before wrapping her lips around the head of his cock circling her tongue. Caleb moans huskily before petting her head approvingly. She takes more of him in her mouth-a bit more than her first time and without choking-and began bobbing her head back and forth. She then reaches around grabbing his rear for support as she savored the delicious taste of his precum. Caleb grit his teeth to hold out from blowing too early. He could feel himself scrapping against her warm, wet mouth while her tongue massaged his length. The sounds of her delighted moans accompanied by the sucking and sloshing wetness was almost enough to drown out Barry Whites voice. A few moments pass and Caleb was already reaching his limit."Haaaahhh...Moon pie I can't...", before he could finish Mirabelle sped up her pace seemingly understanding what he meant; she even tightened her grip on his rear."Ahhh Moon pie!", he calls out holding her head in place as he climaxed in her mouth. Mirabelle trembled gulping down as much as she could. She releases his rear and his member before slumping back breathing heavily as her entire body shuddered. Caleb took a minute to catch his breath while his heart felt like it could burst from his chest; in this world it probably could. He looks at Mirabelle to see little of his cum along with her saliva covered her chin which Caleb giggled slightly at."That...haahh was...alot Dear. More than I expected.", Mirabelle says with a content smile then licking her bottom lip before swaying in bubbly manner, "~Haha, and so tasty.~"Caleb grinned sheepishly at her comment, "uhh, thanks? I guess, still not sure how to feel about that."After catching his breath, he squats down beside Mirabelle and whispers in her ear, "Hey, now I've got a little surprise for you. Stand up please."Mirabelle was puzzled but curious but she complied. A large Roman-style column appears in front of further adding to her confusion. She then feels his hands gliding against her lower horse half before turning to him."Heh, uhh, don't think this is weird but I...may have done a little research on Centaur physiology.", Caleb begins a bit nervous, "Interesting stuff about muscle development, bone structure, but what stuck out to me was...the fact female Centaur actually have...a second female organ."Mirabelle flushes with embarassment, "D-Dear, w-what...gasp...wait y-you want to-""I know, I know, and you can totally object if you're not ok with that! I...just wanted show you I love EVERYTHING about you and that every part of you is attractive. Again, if you don't want to that's fine.", Caleb says gently petting her back. Mirabelle stared at him speechless while thinking it over before and looking up a him sweetly."Dear...I trust you. As long as it's you...I'm ok.", Mirabelle says smiling approvingly."I'll stop whenever you say so.", Caleb replies before resuming. His hand glides along her short, velvet-smooth fur before finally reaching her rear. He felt her body tremble as he adoringly carassed her curvaceous heart-shaped horsey bottom. He moves her tail, which felt light as air, and gets an eye full of her already glistening wet pussy. It was a darker shade of purple with almost no fur save the short fur surrounding it. An outside observer would've seen what he's doing as appalling or even disgusting but he couldn't care less. They're just jealous THEIR girlfriend isn't pony thick! Mirabelle bit her bottom lip with every touch as her heart pounded in her chest in anticipation. She lets out a startled yelp when his finger begins stroking her lips and tracing along the shape."C-Caleb...haaaa...", Mirabelle croons unable to suppress her moans. Caleb takes the hint an slowly shoves his index and middle finger inside her eliciting a sharp gasp for her. He enthusiastically explores her moist, hot and velvety walls that contracted around his fingers in a welcoming grip. The steam radiating from her insides were laced with a sweet, intoxicating scent; almost like lavender and vanilla. Her tail whipped about energetically almost hitting him an leaving purple mist behind.Mirabelle pressed her hands against the column for support breathing erratically as ecstasy surged throughout her body, "~Haaaa...haaa...m-more...Caleb, stir up my insides more!~", she utters through ragged breath."Your wish is my command.", Caleb impetuously says in a regal tone before standing up. He then adds his ring and pinky fingers eliciting another startled moan at the sudden intrusion. Her juices soak half his hand as he hooks and scrapes her undulating flesh; all while he rear shakes about instinctively seeking more pleasure. He stands up, grabs her tail with his free hand, and pulls while still clawing around her ever tightening walls. Mirabelle was driven over the edge. She slumps on the column for support breathing erratically her breasts mush into it."Yes! Haagghhh yes Dear! Ahhhhhaa...", Mirabelle moaned blissfully as Caleb increased his pace."Damn Moon pie...you are tight. I can feel you squeezing my whole hand.", Caleb utters as the sound of sloshing wetness permeates his ears. Accompanying was the sweet lavenderish vanilla scent that he found very intoxicating."It's Ahh b-because...I lovAhhhh your touch so much...Haaaa please...stir me up more!", Mirabelle lustfully moans shaking her rear hips forcing his hand deeper inside her until only his thumb was left outside for support. Her legs trembled like a newborn deer about to give out any time. Caleb gulped watching her love juices trickle down here rear and legs. Finally, he couldn't stand it anymore. He needed to taste more of her.To her confusion, he removes his hand before squatting in front of her glistening, hot center. She gasps in surprise as he uses his thumbs to spread her open and marveling at her purplish pink insides before licking her from bottom up. She lets out a wanton shriek throwing her head back."Haaahhh...OH DEAR LORD HYNOS YES! Yes! Taste me more my love!", Mirabelle shouted her eyes rolling to the back of her head as Caleb's sends pulses of pleasure throughout his body. He happily obliged and swirled his tongue deep inside her tasting her sweet love nectar. He digs his fingers into her hips pushing himself deep into her hot crevice. The sound of slurping and sucking coming from her boyfriend servicing her filled her ears and gave her an indescribable joy. Her walls began clenching around Caleb's tongue signalling her limit was near."~Dear...Dear...I-I can't hold...please I'm about to-HYAAAAAHHHHAAA!", Mirabelle shrieks in ecstasy feeling her orgasm wash over her and leaving Caleb's face covered in love nectar. Mirabelle's legs give out and she collapses on the floor panting in exhaustion. Caleb plops down on his butt summoning a towel and wiping his face. He shuffles over to her and gently pets her head before she looks up at him with a satisfied grin.Caleb smiles back at her slyly, "Well...I guess this part of you isn't so unsightly now is it?"Mirabelle rolls her eyes playfully, "Alright, you win. You realize though this cements you as a cheeky pervert.", she gives him a loving smooch on the cheek beaming at him, "But you're MY cheeky pervert...one with a bloody nice buttocks.""Oh god, what have I done to you?", Caleb stated in mock devastation."Ehehehe, nothing, compared to what I'm to do to you.", Mirabelle speaks in a sultry tone pressing her breasts into his chest.Caleb grins excitedly, "Ooooh looks like somebody ready for round 2."...In the real world...Lyca groggily stumbled to the bathroom having been woken up by an impatient bladder. She was passing Caleb's bedroom door when her ear twitches hearing a faint sound coming from inside. Out of curiosity, she listened closely.~Haaahhh...Moon pie...that's it...just like that.~, he softly moans in his sleep. Lyca raises an eyebrow. Is he talking in his sleep? And was he dreaming about Mira? She looks down at the floor sadly before another sound caught her attention. This time she noticed it was coming from Mirabelle's room.~Yes...haahh more...it feels...so good...Dear~, she softly moans in her sleep. Lyca gave a puzzled expression. She glances between Mirabelle and Caleb's door listening to them. Were they dreaming at the same time or something? She tilts her head quite confused as to what was happening. Suddenly she feels a cramp in her stomach and remember she had to go to the bathroom....The rest of the night was filled with quite a few orgasms and lovey-dovey moments between Caleb and Mirabelle. All of which helped Caleb further suppress his...complicated feelings....The Next Morning...It was pleasant first weekend of August and the town was slowly coming to life with people going about their routines. Air was warm and comforting as the morning rays covering the down in welcoming ambience. School buses could be seen travel down the streets preparing for the routes to the elementary and high schools.'~I BLESS THE WAVES DOWN IN AAAAFRICAA! GONNA TAKE SOME TIME T-~', Caleb silences his phones alarm before rising up with a yawn. Despite waking up at 6:30 am on a Saturday, he couldn't help but feel happy.He then felt something cool and damp on his lower body. He threw the cover off and was greeted by the...half dry half gooey state of his boxers. Even part of his sheets were stained."Sigh, wet dreams.", He shakes his head before awkwardly getting to his feet feeling the gross sensation clinging to his groin. He takes his sheets and ball them up in a small pile then grabs the hem of his underwear and peels it off flinging it into the pile. He grabs a few tissue from the nightstand and wipes off the residual from his balls and groin before slipping on a fresh pair of boxers."Oof, I seriously need a shower.", he utters to himself referencing how much sweat he built up in the night. He chuckles to himself remembering the dream before grabbing a blue Dragon ball Z t-shirt and beige pants along with his cum-stained pile then leaving his bedroom. He hangs the small rectangular sign on the outside doorknob he made to alert the girls he was in there before going inside, throwing the pile in a laundry hamper, a proceeding to the shower.17 minutes pass and Caleb exits the bathroom fresh, clean and ready to start breakfast for him and the girls. He puts on a green apron a sillouhette of Luigi and flips on the tv to use as background noise on pops what appears to be a news special.'And it looks Halstaur milk may soon become available in many local grocery stores. In other news, an update to yesterday's protesters rallying in Huntsville over the Interspecies Marriage act; an ICEP sponsored program that-'"Nope.", Caleb changes the channel to a random movie, 'The Hangover', and goes to the fridge, "it's a new day, not having any of that right now.", says before placing the bread, cheese, and butter on the counter. He hums blissfully to himself before turning on a second burner and placing a frying pan on it. He then grabs a few cinnamon rolls and pops them in the oven. Then he turns on the coffee maker, adding a couple packets of French vanilla creamer.20 minutes later, he Caleb had finished the scrambled eggs and was now almost done with the grilled cheese sandwiches, strawberry oatmeal, and steak strips. The smell of fresh home Southern cooking wafted throughout the living room. Caleb contently smiled to himself scooping the last of the grilled cheeses in the serving tray then shifting the steak strips over. Right as he opened the oven to check on the cinnamon roll, he could make out Lyca's voice coming from the hall along with Mirabelle's. He grins to himself feeling this morning would be a peaceful one."Buenos Dias, Señor.", came the voice of Camilla and Caleb tenses up defensively. There goes his calm. He turn to see her beaming at him from behind the counter her tail swaying happily. He awkwardly smiles back at her."Morning uh...Camilla. How ya doing this morning?", Caleb stated trying his best not to fumble his words."Much better Señor, thank ju for asking?", She says smiling warmly at him taking a seat. He instantly felt nervous and uncomfortable deciding to refocus on cooking."Ahem, so...breakfast will be ready soon. Are you going to wash up?", Caleb inquires."I already have. Actually, I went in a few minutos after ju came out Señor. Señorita Mirabelle and Lyca just went in, I heard the door lock just now.", Camilla says looking in the direction of the hallway."You can hear that? Even with the skillets sizzling and the TV going?", Caleb inquired curiously yet also cursing not being able to get her somewhere else."Si, Devils have extremely acute senses of hearing. So much, we are highly sensitive to loud noises and have to be taught very young to filter out our surroundings and focus on what we want to listen to.", Camilla explains."Heh, story of my life.", Caleb giggles lightly opening box of breakfast sausages then adding them into the hot skillet."Que? What do ju mean?", Camilla says puzzled.Caleb shakes his head, "Oh, nothing just...thinking out loud."Suddenly the timer on the over goes off alerting the rolls were done."Ahh shit", Caleb curses to himself since he still had to make sure the steaks and sausages did overcook but didn't want the rolls to burn. His eyes widen as the oven swings down before the tray of cinnamon rolls comes floating out surrounded in blue shimmering aura. He turns his head to see Camilla with her finger pointed out and a blue magic seal in front of it."It looked like ju needed a little help.", Camilla winks playfully at him, "And ju know I am happy to help anytime Señor." Caleb quickly looks away hiding his blush which Camilla immediately notices and attempts to salvage the situation, "W-With cooking! I meant...I could help with cooking or keeping the house clean. It's the least I could do.""R-Right, thank you. That's quite considerate of you.", Caleb says placing the sausages and steak strips in their individual piles. He then turns to the levitating tray of cinnamon rolls, grabs the glaze bottle and spreads it all over. Camilla nods and, with slight movement of her finger, the tray glides toward her resting in front of her."Alright, everything's ready. Mind giving me a hand?", Caleb asks holding the tray of piled with Sausage and beef strips. Camilla examines it and the tray stacked with grilled cheeses, scrambled eggs, and small bowl of strawberry oatmeal behind him."That is quite a lot, Senor. Are ju expecting company?", Camilla inquired levitating the tray of grilled cheeses, oatmeal, and scrambled eggs towards her and placing in near the cinnamon rolls."I wasn't sure if the Zyklons were going to join us or not so I made extra in case.", Caleb says placing the tray of food next to the other tray before going to the cabinet to grab plates and utensils."That's nice of ju.", Camilla replies creating a large red magic seal underneath the trays of the food and starts radiating heat. Caleb raises an eyebrow at her before she replies, "It's so that everything stays warm and fresh."Caleb takes seven plates from the cabinet, "Practical. Also, not really. I'm just upholding my end of our deal.""Oh? What deal would that be?"Camilla and Caleb were startled by the unknown voice with the latter nearly dropping the plates out his hands and the former instinctively creating a magic seal in the direction of the voice as it let out a sudden shout.Caleb quickly came from the kitchen surprised to see Sterling levitating in air; his movements restricted and surrounded in blue aura."Sterling?! Jesus fu-what the hell, you nearly gave me a heart attack!", Caleb stated incredulously."Estupido! I should crush your bones to paste!", Camilla hissed at him unfurrowing her wings and glaring at him."Good morning to both of you too.", Sterling replies unflinchingly, "Um, would you mind putting me down Ms. Sartana?"Camilla looks at Caleb who nods begrudgingly at her. She lowers him down to the floor before quickly withdrawing her arm allowing Sterling to fall landing on his feet. Camilla crosses her arms disappovingly at him."Well, not the worst way I've been greeted in the morning. Maybe somewhere in the top ten, possibly third.", Sterling says brushing himself off."Seriously, are you a freakin ninja or something? How do you not make any sound when you come in here?", Caleb replies walking towards him, "Si, how ya been, haven't seen or heard from ya in a few days?""That information is classified and I've had my hands full dealing with a couple of unruly houseguests and enforcing some new regulations from the higher-ups.", Sterling replies."Sounds like you've had your hands full. What brings you here this early in the morning?", Caleb continues."I have something important to discuss with everyone. But before that, what is this 'deal' you we're speaking of?", Sterling inquires raising an eyebrow.Caleb pauses while Camilla gives a concerned look, "Well uhh-""Dear, was that you screaming? What's wrong?!", Mirabelle worriedly inquired trodding from the hallway followed by Lyca."Are you ok Chief?!""No girls, it was just Sterling getting choked out by Camilla. ", Caleb said as Camilla subtly smirked at his comment. Mirabelle and Lyca paused before finally noticing Sterling casually waving at them. Lyca snorts to herself wishing she could've seen it."Good morning, Ms. Marequine. Ms. Kessler.", Sterling greeted them ignoring Caleb's comment."Oh, good morning Sterling. It's quite a while since you've visited.", Mirabelle says giving a warm smile."Yeah, sup gramps.", Lyca jeeringly says to him before noticing the tray of food, "Oh, Chief is breakfast ready? I'm starving.""Sure Lyca, go ahead and grab a fork", Caleb replies gladly handing her a plate. She accepted it, went to grab a fork from the kitchen.Caleb then noticed Mirabelle repeatedly glancing at Camilla uneasy of how close she was to Caleb. Camilla notices her staring."Oh, Buenos Dias...Señorita Mirabelle.", Camilla hesitantly says in sweet tone snapping Mirabelle from her thoughts."A-Ah, yes. G-good morning to you too...Camilla.", Mirabelle stutters while putting on a smile.Camilla senses her uneasiness, "Did ju...sleep well""Oh, yes, I did.", Mirabelle says before staring knowingly at Caleb with a faint blush, "You can say I slept exceptionally well."Caleb smirks at her before winking slyly. Camilla looks between them curiously already piecing things together and sadly smiling.Mirabelle clears her throat, "Breakfast looks wonderful dear.", she says grabbing a plate putting a couple grilled cheese and some cinnamon rolls going around the couch.Suddenly, they hear a knock at the door accompanied by the voices of Ein and Zwei."Oh, looks like they've come to join us ", Caleb started towards the door only to be stopped by Sterling."It's alright, I'll get it.", Sterling turns and opens the door."Hello, Mr. Bizzell we just wanted to check that you were doing ok since yesterday's...AH What is Zwei", Ein glared at her sister who had been incessantly tapping her side before noticing her panicked wide eyed expression."Good morning Ms. Ein.", Sterling says before Ein whips her head around eyes widening as Sterling stands in the doorway."Ohhhhh Agent Sterling sir...m-morning to you as well...sir?", Ein stutters nervously surprised to see him. Zwei gives a toothy grin like a child hiding they did something wrong. Drei appears to be more interested in why an old human lady walking a cat...using a shoestring?"Ah, what a coincidence. We were just talking about you three and some sort of 'deal' you have with Mr. Bessell.", Sterling says before Ein and Zwei's faces turn pale like they just seen a ghost. Drei is still fixated on this woman and her cat, "Please, come in.""Hey, first off, my name is 'Bizzell'. Second, that's my line.", Caleb says taking offense, "Come on in guys, breakfast is ready if you're hungry."Zwei instantly feels at ease by his words and the prospect of homecooked food before stepping inside. Ein hurriedly steps inside nervously avoiding eye contact with Sterling. Drei steps inside too; deciding to solve the mystery of the shoestring cat lady later."I've got a few plates for you guys so just pick whatever you-", Caleb started before Zwei came up to him."Hey...how's Lyca doing?! Is she...", Zwei inquired with a concerned look."Hey Zwei!", Lyca enthusiastically greeted from the couch with her cheeks full of sausage and holding up a forkfull of beef strips, "I'm fine, how are you?"Zwei happily beams at her, "Lyca!""Don't worry, I talked to her.", Caleb whispers in Zwei's ear, "Plates and forks are right there go ahead and fix yourself a plate.", Caleb patted Zwei on the shoulder."Thanks Mr. B, I'll take you up on that.", Zwei grins then winks at him before grabbing a plate.Caleb beams handing her a plate before turning to Ein, "How bout you, Ein?""O-Oh, thank you Mr. Bizzell.", Ein politely accepts it and bows slightly. She then notices Camilla staring at her intently, "What?", Ein inquires sternly."I...I want to apologize for what I said. I understand you were only helping us. I am sorry.", Camilla apologized with a hint of shame in her tone. Caleb, Mirabelle, and the others watch their exchange with varying degrees of interest. Ein could sense she really meant every word and approach Camilla laying a hand on her shoulder."It's ok. I know you were just upset so don't beat yourself up too much over it.", Ein stated."Gracias.", Camilla grins and Ein returns giving patting her a couple pats then turning to fix herself a plate of eggs and beef strips. Caleb nods in approval as Camilla goes off into the kitchen presumably to do a little cleaning."Ok, clearly a lot has happened in the time since we last spoke.", Sterling says taking a seat near the dining room table, "Mind getting me up to date?"Ein tenses her fur standing up worriedly."It's...kind of a long story so you want to join us for breakfast? I already know that's like...20% of the reason you're hear so early.", Caleb inquired walking into the kitchen passing Camilla who had just put the skillets in the sink and washed the counter for him."Thanks for the offer, but I already grabbed a bite at a new café. I will have some of your coffee though, the one I had earlier was awful. Like sugary mud.", Sterling says making a face of disgust, "I like you make it."Caleb rolls his eyes grabbing a mug, filling it with fresh morning brew, "You say it like mine is any better.""It is actually. They way you make it...I don't know, it just...perfectly balanced.", Sterling says as Caleb hands him the mug from across the counter."As all things should be.", Caleb commented before taking a bite out of a grilled cheese and composing himself, "Alright, let's begin...so...yesterday started out fine...then...it wasn't-", Caleb says before interrupts."If you're referring to the incident at the restaurant yesterday, I already know about it.", Sterling sips his coffee as Caleb and the others give him surprised look, "Don't look so surprised, information has a way of traveling fast. Which of course, makes it that much harder to suppress...but not impossible.""So...you know about that? How?", Caleb asks starting to become angry if he pulled the same 'test' as when Mirabelle first came to live with him."No, I only knew from Ms. Drei tipping me off about a suspicious liminal woman. I sent an agent there afterwards to get the full story from the owner of the store.", Sterling says as said wind weasel casually but sensuallly licking the icing off the cinnamon roll before giving a thumbs up, "Honestly, I want to commend her along with her sisters on their performance on yesterday. If it weren't for you three, this could've had much more dire repercussions for ICEP's image and the lives of other Devil species living here.""O-Oh, no thanks are necessary just completing our mission as effectively as possible.", Ein say her ears and tail flicking happily with a content expression."Of course, all in a days work sir.", Zwei added, "So can we expect raises some time in the fu-ACK!"Ein delivered a swift chop the back of Zwei's neck knocking her out; all while her content expression never falters."Did you manage to find anything on the Angel?", Drei inquired to Sterling.Sterling gave a disgruntled sigh, "Unfortunately, no. There doesn't appear to be anything in our records. We've decided look a bit deeper to find any sightings of an Angel fitting her description, but so far nothing. It's almost like she appeared out of nowhere.""Yeah, to make our lives a living hell.", Caleb stated in a sour tone, "She comes in feeding those people's paranoia and hatred to Camilla. She was going to go as far to KILL us along with everyone else around her.""And those people just blindly listened to every word she said. It was very disturbing how easily swayed they were just because of her species.", Mirabelle added."She said such awful things about us. I just wanted to bear the crap out of her.", Lyca says arms crossed and fangs bared in irritation."That's why we're making such effort to find her. We can't allow a liminal that dangerous out and about among a populace that view her with blind admiration.", Sterling spoke not liking the thought of it at all.Caleb crossed his arms back against the counter, "I tell ya, first the restaurant, then those damn Nazis and KKK protesters on our way home.", Caleb gives a tired sigh, "We just couldn't catch a break yesterday.""Ah, yes. I heard about. Apparently, they've making their way from Mississippi in response to ICEP's anullment of the Exchange bill.", Sterling pauses in realization, "Ah, that's right I almost forgot. That's one of the things I wanted to discuss with you.""Let me guess, Interspecies marriage is now legal? Yeah we know already Sterling.", Caleb says as each of the girls voice their individual confirmation."Well then, I guess that saves us some time so we can get down to the issue of..."what now?" ", Sterling says before finishing his coffee. Caleb and each of the girls exchanged a mixture of confused and intrigued looks."What do ju mean by 'what now' ?", Camilla asks with a skeptical look.Sterling raises from his seat, "I mean, like I've informed other hosts, legal marriage is only applicable as long as both parties consent. This options come with several benefits; employment, insurance plans, a lift on travel restrictions. But, one of the primary benefits is full citizenship without need to take I.F.C. exam (Interspecies Full Citizenship). However, that's also our biggest hurdle.""How so?", Mirabelle inquires."There are still groups, human and liminal, who don't wish for this to come to pass. Ones less bellicose than those protesters but still quite vocal. Some we haven't seen since the early stages of the program. They believe giving full citizenship will disrupt their way of life and the structure of their species as a whole. As such, they enforce that romantic relationships and marriage between humans and liminals are unsustainable despite the results we've gathered in multiple states from test families of various species, that romantic relationships ARE possible. That along with studies from several countries that have already legalized marriage. The states are still divided on the matter and Alabama is one of the states pushing to abolish it. We need at least 70% of the popular vote to fully put the marriage plan into action. We need more families from those states to prove that it's possible for integration to succeed. I've met hosts who have built strong relationships with their houseguests. Many have even fallen in love and want to help them take that next step. I...I want to see that happen.", Sterling fervently stated before turning, "That includes you too, Mr. Bizzell."Caleb was immediately taken aback by what he said. Mirabelle and Camilla were also surprised and were blushing at his implications."W-Where'd THAT come from? Look... I understand what you're saying Sterling but...I don't think it applies to us all that much.", Caleb replies."Oh...I believe it does, Mr. Bizzell.", Sterling in an almost cryptic tone which started to alarm Caleb and a few of the girls."What uhhh...w-what are talking about Sterling?", Caleb inquired becoming nervous.Sterling sighs, "Alright, I'll stop dancing around it. Mr. Bizzell, I already know about everything that happened a several days ago...during the last full moon."Caleb and the girls were taken aback utterly shocked by the revelation. Mirabelle, Lyca, and Camilla wore horrified and flabbergasted expressions. Ein and Zwei's blood ran cold and they felt a surge of panic run through their bodies. Drei appeared surprised as well but not quite much."W...I...You...how...what...", Caleb stuttered unable to even process his thoughts."Ahem, Agent Sterling, would you mind telling us HOW you know this?", Drei asked as Caleb silently thanking her, "I'm certain that strange blast of energy knocked out most of houses security and surveillance systems."Mirabelle touches her fingers together in embarassment."A little birdy told me...", Sterling looks up at the ceiling fan. Caleb and the girls were surprised when a small glowing bundle of yellow light floating down from the fan blades leaving a trail of yellow sparkles on it's trail. Sterling raised his palm as the glowing bundle of light dissipates revealing a tiny girl with transparent wing, elongated ears, a yellow short dress with matching shoes, "or, more specifically, a little fairy."Everyone stared fixated on the tiny creature unable to find the right words to express the shock they were feeling.Sterling could sense their confusion, "This is Filo. She's been keeping a bit of an eye on everyone all week under my instruction.""Hello! Nice to finally meet you all.", the fairy girl greeted in an adorably high-pitched voice."Sterling...what in the hell is going on?!", Caleb inquired glaring at him. Mirabelle The other others turned to him demanding answers as well."Well, Filo is a part this program we're experimenting with-", Sterling was immediately cut off"That is NOT what he meant!", Camilla stated her eyes furious, "Why did ju have that...thing spy on us?!"" 'spy' is vulgar word, Filo was only, figuratively and literally, micromanagement.", Sterling answers as Filo had a worried expression."So...you know?", Ein uttered trembling with her head down, "Everything...we did. You really didn't trust us. Not surprising, given how shamefully we acted and treated the very person we were assigned to protect. That's it then, we're going to be discharged.", Ein spoke sadly hanging her head to her knees feeling like total failure. Zwei rubbed her back trying to comfort her. Drei went to her sister to comfort her as well. Lyca gazed at them sadly before shooting angry glare at Sterling.Sterling rose up with Filo on his shoulder, "Whoa, whoa, nobody said anything about being discharged.""Why would you do this Sterling?", Mirabelle with a look of betrayal."Please listen, this was only necessary to see what kind of progress you were all making-", Sterling was immediately interrupted when Caleb stepped in front of him."Progress?! What are you talking about? You know what me and the girls went through on that day?! All of us could've been hurt or much worse! How could you be so irresponsible dammit?!", Caleb shouted at him. Sterling felt the sting of the last part and he snapped."Yes, I know alllllll too well what COULD'VE happened! You're not the only one who's FORGOTTEN about the sleeping pills! You're not the only one who suffered the consequences for it! You're not the only one who felt sick, scared or ashamed afterwards!", Sterling pauses, "But...you ARE one of the very few, despite everything, who picked up the pieces and rebuilt what could've been lost! Most in your case would have resigned from the program by now and had his homestays removed. But not you, Mr. Bizzell. You buckled down, talked it out with each of them, and you, ALL of you, worked past it together. Something like that doesn't happen often."Caleb felt his anger wane slightly as he reflected on his words. Camilla and Lyca looked ready to rip into him, verbally AND literally. Mirabelle appeared uncertain if she could believe him but also reflecting on his words. Ein was still despairing as Zwei wore a somber expression and Drei listened intently to Sterling."Listen, I know how you all must feel but I did this with the best of intentions; for the program AND for you and your homestays, Mr. Bizzell.", Sterling affirmed."What do you mean?", Caleb skeptically inquired."Filo informed me of...everything...you did for everyone here's sake. That includes the heartfelt conversations you had with the girls, your confession to Ms. Marequine, even the 'deal' worked out with the Zyklons.", Sterling sees their expressions become more intense. Camilla discreetly conjures a magic seal ready to silence him at any moment."But...", he continued, "I want you all to know...for now...your secret is safe with me. Nobody else knows any of this except for Filo and I."Everyone to Sterling with surprised and confused looks.Ein jumps up eying Sterling, "What?! B-B-But we-""I know, Ms. Zyklon. You and Zwei's actions are typically punishable by expulsion. However, given the circumstances and Drei's performance on that night, I've decided to keep you on as Caleb's personal bodyguards. ONLY on the condition you never allow anything like this to happen again, understood?", Sterling finished sternly.Ein grinned happily tears forming in her eyes and clutching her hands to her chest while Zwei flops on the couch exhaling in relief."ThankyouThankyouThankyou sir, we promise we'll work twice as diligently as before!", Ein says saluting him."Easy.", Drei softly advises her sister."W-Why?! Why would you do that for us?", Caleb asked incredulously."I told you already Mr. Bizzell, I want to see hosts like yourself move forward in their relationships with their houseguests. I know you love them all and Ms. Marequine, Sartana, and Kessler all love you.", Sterling says as Caleb and the girls flush at his statement."Well...yeah but-", Caleb started before the little yellow fairy got in his face startling him a bit."Noppppe! Nope nope nope! There's no use in denying it! We fairies can sense emotions no matter how repressed! Youuu may be in love with the horse lady, but you also care very deeply about the wolf girl, demon lady, and even the three weasels ladies.", Filo stated darting around Caleb, "Hooorse lady is VERY deeply in love with you! Annnd not just her, wolf girl is in love with you too, and so is the demon lady!", she says darting between them respectively as said girls blush feverishly.Filo then stops at the Zyklons as they gazed up expectantly, "...Hmmm, you guys are a work in progress.", she then darts away leaving them confused."Wait, what does that mean?", Zwei questions her sisters who shrug.Mirabelle, Camilla, and Lyca fall silent as they gave each other pensive almost sorrowful expressions. Caleb mind becomes flooded and decides to sit down on the back of the couch near Mirabelle."There you have it Mr. Bizzell.", Sterling says sitting back down in his seat with Filo fluttering next to him, "Now, there's one last thing I didn't mention. It concerns a special case in the marriage plan.""And what would that be?", Caleb lethargically asks not even bothering to look at Sterling."There's a section in the marriage plan that accounts for races who practice marriage of multiple spouses, such as lamia. The purpose of this section is so that mono-gendered races have a legal method of procreation that supplements their dramatically declining birthrates. However, we're trying to extended so that, under certain conditions, hosts in similar scenarios like this are able have multiple spouses who unanimously consent to marriage. Unfortunately, and unsurprisingly, this is proving even more difficult to employ than a standard monogamous marriage. So far, 63% of the country has voted against it claiming to be nonviable, immoral by social standards, or just frowned upon. Despite several known cases in other countries, like one case in Japan where a man married 7 spouses, that prove multi-spousal marriage IS sustainable our government refuses to budge. They say they have no cases in THIS country that proves it can work.", Sterling smirks and speaks confidently, "But, I think I found a solution to that."Caleb and the girls each perk up their heads toward Sterling, all of them collectively thinking the same thing."Sterling, what EXACTLY are you trying to say?", Caleb inquires eyes widening in fear.Sterling rises up, "I have a proposal for you and your homestays, Mr. Bizzell. After ruminating on the idea and from what we've learned now, I've determined you are all perfect candidates for United State's first multi-spousal marriage!"Silence befell the entire room. Caleb and most of the girls wide-eyed, mouth agape trying to comprehend the sheer absurdity of the situation. Even Drei was speechless.Filo fluttered close to Sterling's ear, "I think they like the idea."...Elsewhere...Atop the roof of a tall building located downtown, a figure sat her legs crossed dangling over the edge. She leisurely sipped her cinnamon mocha latté while allowing her now snow white wings to bathe in the sun's rays. Anyone who saw her would see her as the definition of angelic beauty. However..."Hehehehehe Ahahahahaha! Damn, the world really is small.", Azaeli cackled holding a photo, "Who would've thought I'd run into you at such a convenient time?"Azaeli then remembered her conversation with that Malone associate at the bar.***** 'Now listen, after you do it, he's going to need some proof.', says the bald associate wearing a plain sleeves white tank with tattoos on his right arm, faded jeans, and leather shoes.'Pfft, what, does he want me to him through the mail piece by piece?', Azaeli scoffed.'He only said to call him when you finish the job. And here, this is your down payment and a picture of that Bizzell fella. Good thing he got it before the news sites had time to take'em all down.', he hands her a folded brown grocery bag. She accepts and opens it eyes widening at the large stack of hundreds.She grins happily fanning the money with her finger, "Music to mama's ears.", she then notices the picture and picks it up, "huh, so this is th...no...no way! No fuckin' way, Hahaaa!'****"If that big titted piece of demon trash and that cat-eared midget hadn't got in the way, I could busy spoiling myself more right now.", Azaeli tosses the half empty cup off the ledge before tucking the picture in her bra, "Sucks they couldn't at least give me his address too. That would've made this alot easier Welp, I just gotta find him. Shouldn't be too much trouble, like find a needle in a haystack, all I need is a magnet.", she said creating a tiny yellow magic seal around the photo. An ancient Hebrew symbol appeared on the photo.Azaeli spreads her wings and leaps off the building taking off at high speeds beginning her crusade, "~Ready or not, here I come Caleb!~"WRHello Fam!

    Chapter Text
    Bonus: Farmers MarketWRSup Fam? Okay, after...several issues with my page, I've decided to just upload my bonus chapters here from now on. One of the more...imperative issues were...of the legal nature and I was 'requested' to remove my page. So bye bye , you were too good for this world. But hey, at least I get to keep my content. Plus, truth be told, these bonus chapters are kinda fun to write. Anyway here's one of the bonuses I made a couple weeks back.Lastly, just to make things clear, I AM going to continue with the main story. These are just extra material I moving here because of copyright issues( seriously it's total bullshit, I didn't do nothing wrong.) Think of these like...Canon filler.*These events take place between Chapter 3 and Chapter 4*The Summer sun was shining on a lovely afternoon in the local farmers market. It was quite lively today with farmers from all around Alabama, and even parts of Georgia and Mississippi, selling their freshly harvested goods. There were market stalls and stands filled with a marriad of fresh vegetables and fruit ranging from shucks of corn to baskets of freshly picked Georgia peaches. They were even stalls where people sold hand-crafted jewelry, decorations, baskets, and small wood carved statues of animals.Caleb and Mirabelle were walking side by side passing through the roadway and taking the sights around them. Men and women bartering at stalls, talking with buddie from town, and some sitting in the shade of canopies.Mirabelle takes a long, slow inhale appreciating the earthy but robust scent of fresh grown produce then blissfully exhales."Heh, you seem oddly relaxed right now.", Caleb says with smirk."This place. The earthy scent of harvested crops, it reminds me of my home village.", Mirabelle happily reminisces.Caleb nods, "Yeah, markets like these are pretty common in the South. Personally I always kinda liked the smell of farmer grown produce. There's just something...satisfying about them, you know?""I understand perfectly Dear. There nothing I find more satisfying than creating something with my own two hands from the ground up.", Mirabelle hums with a hint of pride."Hehe, Guess you and I are alike in that regard.", Caleb chuckles gently patting her on the back. Mirabelle blushes sweetly marveling that she shares another thing in common with him, "That being said, most of the stuff here smells AND looks pretty good. Why don't we pick up some good food today straight from mother earth's bosom", Caleb says showing a couple carrying baskets he picked up near the entrance.Mirabelle beams at him giggling sweetly, "I would be delighted."The two spent the next hour looking at a variety of produce. Mirabelle was even less nervous around other people, particularly the farmers selling their goods. In fact, she even engaged in a few discussions with a couple of the farmers about agricultural methods. Caleb guessed it must be easier talking about something she's especially passionate and proud about. Also, in that time, they had collected a sizeable bounty consisting of a bushel of Georgia peaches, husks of corn, muscadines, squash, zucchini, and green beans. They got so loaded up it became cumbersome to care by hand. Luckily, they found a small wagon no one was using and decided to borrow it.Caleb squatted down looking at the the collection of goods they picked up already musing over how surreal it was that he never really bothered shopping there; since he saw no real point to it. But, being there with Mirabelle, seeing how excited she is about this stuff, he remember how much he enjoyed going to places like this with his parents.Caleb smiles to himself rising up, "Alright, Moon pie what should we check out next?"He got no response. He looks over to see her silently facing away from him; her entire body fidgeting and her tail whips energetically send small puff of purple mist around, "uhhh...", Caleb utters noticing she's biting her finger hungrily with eyes fixated on a stall filled with carrots and red, yellow, and green bell peppers. Caleb immediately understood and chuckled to himself. Guess she has more traits of a horse than he thought. He pats her on the back and she jolted looking at him curiously."Let's pick out some fresh ones, K?", Caleb saysMirabelle attempts to wave him off, "N-No, Dear, It's fine. You've already bought plenty for us.""You know you're a bad liar Moon pie.", Caleb says which surprises her, "That mouth says no, but your says 'Yesyesyesyesyesyesyes!' "Mirabelle blushes wanting to deny it but was unable to. He got her."Hello sir! Fine looking carrots ya got here.", Caleb says to the stall owner. He was a hefty Caucasian man, possibly early 50s, wearing blue overalls with a red shirt under it and wrangler boots."Yessirree, planted'em earlier this year so they is ripe and crunchy.", spoke the man in a deep Mississippi accent."Perfect, my ward and I were lookin' for some to put in our stew this evening.", Caleb steps allowing the man a good look at her. He smiles at her as she nervously waves at him before turning her attention back to the carrots."Gooday ma'am.", he nods to Mirabelle."H-Hello, um, may I say that these look...incredible? No mishapins, discoloration, or even forked roots. You must have regularly tilled your soil?", Mirabelle stated with intrigued.The man heartily chuckles, "I sho'nough did. Made sure to use a trowel and kept on raking and loosen the dirt up. Do that 4 times in the week. You must grow some too, ehehe."."Yes, I have. In fact,-""Whoooaaaa now, ok sir, don't encourage her. She will NOT leave you alone the rest of the day.", Caleb interrupted earning an annoyed pouty face from her."Hehehe, she's that type huh?",Caleb shakes his head, "You don't know the half of it.", he says earning more hearty laughs from the man."Hmph, I've never heard of such rubbish in my life.", Mirabelle chided as she started sulking arms crossed in defiance.Caleb ignores her, "Your sign say 3 bucks a pound but I don't see a scale.""About 5 carrots make the pound. What can I put'chu down fer?", the man inquired."We'll take...3 bags.", Caleb says as Mirabelle's ears twitch and her pout loosens. The man nods and packs Caleb 3 full bags. Then Caleb gives him a ten before he and Mirabelle thank him and continue about their business. Then soon find a small area of trees and grass that was full of shade and decide to rest. As they say in the shade, Mirabelle continued glancing at the bags with the carrots while trying not to let Caleb notice. He did.Caleb rolls his eyes before deciding he'll just mess with her a bit. He opens one of the bags of carrots, which got her attention, took one out, washed it, then took a bite. Mirabelle licked her lips ears twitching with every crunch her made. He turns to her and she immediately avert her gaze hiding her face. He then takes out another carrot, washed it, then presents it to her."~Moon pie, you want a carrot too? I know you do~", Caleb teased herMirabelle gulps trembling as she fought to keep her urges at bay, "N-n-no thank you, I'm f-fine. Please ""~You can't hide it Moon pie, you know you want it.~", Caleb playfully waves it in front of her twitching nose while her eyes remained close and face muscles quivered. Caleb started to pull back, "Alright, I guess you don't want it t-"Caleb was surprised when she whips her head around at lighting fast speed and gobbled up the orange veggie, green stem and all, without so much as grazing his fingers. As she munched on it, Caleb noted how indescribably content she looked as she ate. It looked like her body, mind, and spirit had all achieve absolute serenity and euphoria. All from a simple carrot.Mirabelle gulps the rest down trembling in pleasure before letting out, " ~neiigghhhh~", she immediately covers her mouth with both hands in shock at what she just did then noticed Caleb staring slack-jawed in surprise.'Did...did she just...whinny?!', Caleb thought incredulously as her stared silently at her. Her face goes beet red before burying it in her palms emitting a shame filled groan."Heh...wow, didn't expect that. Then again, can't say it don't make sense.", Caleb chuckles only for her to groan even louder in misery. She wanted to disappear right now.Caleb moves in front of her. He lays a hand on her head as she flinched from the sudden touch and began gently petting the pouting purple pony."Come on Moon pie, no need to be embarrassed. You should've seen what I did when I ate a dragon fruit for the first time. I didn't even know I could DO a backflip.", Caleb chuckles noticing her demeanor loosen a bit. He took her hands and she allowed him to gently move them from her face. She was still visibly flustered with tears in the corners of her eyes."Y-Y-You don't...think I'm a freak?", Mirabelle stuttered her bottom lip trembling."Now why would I think something like that?", Caleb affirms as she gazed at him with hopeful eyes, "In fact, I happen to think that was the cutest things I've seen in a long time. You really are sweet like a moon pie you know?"Mirabelle's face flushed brighter shade of pink as she heart felt like it was running a marathon. She puts her fingers to her lips sheepishly, "You think I'm...cute?""More so than any cat on youtube.", Caleb replies inciting a chuckle from her. Suddenly, they heard a sound like a growling animal. Mirabelle recoils holding her stomach before Caleb gave her a knowing smirk adding to her awkwardness, "Want a couple more? We've got a few bags.""Ehehehe, yeah, I may take you up on that.", she grins sheepishly tail energetically whipping behind her....Some more time passed as they enjoyed themselves in the farmers market. It was late afternoon when they decided to leave for home; after saying good bye to some goodbye to some of Mirabelle's new farming acquaintances of course.Caleb strutted down the sidewalk dragging the wagon of goodies behind him as Mirabelle hooves clopped against the pavement beside him."So, you enjoy yourself?", Caleb inquired.Mirabelle smiles warmly at him, "I did. Thank you for taking me Dear.""Anytime.", he says before looking at the wagon, "We got quite the stack. What would you say to helping make us a vegetable stew tonight? Maybe some baked peaches and cream for dessert?""It would be my pleasure.", Mirabelle answers her mouth watering at the thought of it."Just...try not to eat to many of the ingredients. They still have to actually GO in the stew.", Caleb quips at her."Oh whatever, you cheeky little wanker.", Mirabelle says in mock annoyance playfully bumping him with her shoulder.Caleb chuckled returning the gesture as she chuckled along with him. They continued on towards their home to enjoy the rest of their day. On the way, Caleb got an idea for a surprise for her. But first, he needed to talk to his landlord.
  
    Chapter Text
    Bonus 2: Clothes Shopping*These events take place between Chapter 5 and Chapter 6*Caleb, Mirabelle, and Lyca enter a large boutique titled, "Las Monstraballes", located within Bridge Street Town Center. There appear to be not many people here save for a few employees and 3 or 4 liminals shoppers."Chief, what is this place? It smells pretty weird in here", Lyca inquired curiously looking around at many assortment of strange garments then uncomfortably referencing strong scent of perfume."This is clothing store Lyca. Humans use them to buy and sell really nice and sometimes really dorky looking clothing. Although...it looks like this place carries clothes for all body types.", Caleb references the assortment of pants and shirts designed for liminals with multiple limbs, varying body types from insectoid to quadrapedal, and even those with alternating forms like slime or shape shifters, "As for the smell, I don't know. I think they pump that crap in through the vents."Mirabelle approached to the side, "What are we here for Dear? I thought we were going to Kami House.""We are, but first my sweet Moon pie it appears we've gotten a raise in the monthly stipend I get for caring for you girls and I wanted to take you out to get y'all some new clothes.", Caleb says patting the pocket with his wallet."Dear that's sweet of you, but I have a decent amount of clothes to wear. No need to trouble yourself.", Mirabelle says trying to convince him."Moon pie, you only had one suitcase when you first moved in and you didn't have that many clothes when Sterling brought you the rest. And Lyca, you've worn those same clothes the past few days now. I'm getting you guys new clothes.", he uses his indoor voice to avoid embarrassing them."Besides, the stipends are technically yours it's only fair I mostly use them for you guys.", Caleb firmly replies as the girls give him plaintive stares before soon relenting. They shrug to each other following him through the women's section into the part where all the liminal clothes are. Mirabelle eyes widened at seeing the variety of clothing tailored to centaur; dress shirts, belts, cloaks, ribbons, swimsuits, even specially designed horse shoes. Lyca appeared to be utterly mesmerized by the different racks of cloths, manecans of various species on display, and shelves full of designer cloths."You guys...see anything you like in particular?", Caleb inquired."Hmm, I guess I could check out some of those cloaks for Centaurs. I wonder if they have anything in my size.", Mirabelle says walking over to the rack labeled 'Womens cloaks'.Caleb turns to Lyca, "What about you Lyca?""I'm not really sure how this 'cloths shopping' thing works; we never had anything like this back home. I don't even know where to begin.", Lyca says quite puzzled"Really? What did you do for clothes then?", Caleb inquired almost embarrassed to ask."We used pelts from the prey we hunted, but only as a display of prowess and status. The stronger members of the pack had lots of pelts whereas weaklings like me could only wear the worn out pelts discarded by the Alphas and Deltas.", Lyca sadly reminisces.Caleb pats her on the head before she looks up at him, "Well it's not like that...well it's similar to that here but no. You can wear whatever you want that expresses who YOU are or want to be, Lyca. It doesn't matter what anyone else says."Lyca grins at him but still unsure, "Ok, but...there's so many choose. Where do I start?""Well...do you like what you're wearing now?", Caleb inquires referring to her denim short shorts and blue tank top to exposed her slim belly."Yeah, it's really comfortable and easy to move in.", Lyca beams at him proudly."Alright, we can start from there. Come on, let's find you something that'll make you look cute.", Caleb says looking around the clothes racks.Lyca blushes thinking to herself while her tail swaying, "C-cute? Me?"Mirabelle excitedly approaches carrying an arm full of clothing, "Look Dear, I found five cloaks in my size! Isn't this one just beautiful?", she says pull a dark purple cloak with little yellow crescent moons decorating it."I should've guessed you'd pick something like that. It looks nice.", Caleb playfully teases before getting closer and whispering to her, " Hey, Moon pie, can you help me help Lyca find her some clothes? She not really used to shopping. Plus, I don't have much taste for fashion."Mirabelle and Caleb look behind to see Lyca circling around curiously sniffing a human manecan wearing polo shirt and capris. Mirabelle gives a concerned frown."Y-yes, perhaps I can help find her some clothes she'll love ( hopefully some that show less skin)""Huh? I didn't catch that last part.", Caleb inquired"Oh, nothing! I was just thinking it could be good bonding experience... and she'd look great in a pink. Yeah.", Mirabelle stuttered before walking over to Lyca who was about to bite the leg of the manecan, "Um, Lyca? Would you like me to help you find some clothes?"Lyca stopped her motion and turned to Mirabelle with confused look that quickly morphed into a gratitude, "Really? Thanks a bunch Mira!"Mirabelle was caught off guard by the sudden nickname but smiled back at her, "Alright, let's start with something simple like a blouse.", she says as Lyca follows her to one of the racks while Caleb kept a close eye on them....They continued on with the shopping for what felt like an hour. The girls eventually found a considerable number of outfits to wear. They would occasionally defer to Caleb on what he thought looked good on them. Terrible idea. Never, ever ask a man what he'd think you'd look best in.Mirabelle stuck with her usual style of casual and conservative longsleeve blouses and dress tops along with the usual Centaurian cloak for bottom. Honestly, Caleb thought they suited her well; especially the ones that gave shape to her large breasts and curvaceous upper body but also created an air of modesty and left more to the imagination.Lyca, while not picky, didn't go for many of the longsleeve dresses and blouses Mirabelle suggested. Instead, preferred clothing that offered more exposer and less restriction. Or more accurately, whatever skin was allowed before Mirabelle and Caleb drew the line. Going by Caleb's advice, she chose tops that showed off her back and toned stomach. Namely, strapless grey or camo tube tops, different colored tank and crop tops, even a few shoulderless t-shirts. As for bottoms, she stuck with shorts. She picked out a several pairs of denim short shorts and hot pants. All of which looked like they barely covered her tight little rear and pleasantly hugged her lean thighs.Being the gentleman he was, Caleb offered to carry their clothes pile.Soon they left and were approaching the area Caleb had dreaded since coming there. The one place where anxiety and awkwardness overtake a man's senses and leave him flustered mess.Underwear shopping. For, not one, but TWO attractive women.As they crossed the border into 'No man's' land, the collection of the gender neutral colors became a deeply feminine colors. Instead of racks of pants, shirts, and socks, all that could be seen were panties, bras, stocking, and numerous collections of lingerie. All of which at different sets for different species. In fact, most of lingerie were made by Arachne. The song 'Who run the world, girls' by Beyonce played throughout the area.Mirabelle fidgeted looking around at the beautiful clothing with a combination of intrigue and embarassment at being in a place like this. Lyca seemed awestruck at the strange garments before her eyes and began inspecting some of the"Ok, I'll just wait outside and leave you girls to your business.", Caleb says pivoting around with the pile of clothes in hand trying desperately to get out while he could. Suddenly, he felt Lyca's furry soft paws grab the hem of his shirt."No, wait Chief, I still need help. I don't know what to choose.", Lyca said with pleading puppy eyes."W-Well that's what Moon Pie's for. Right Moon pie?", Caleb almost begged Mirabelle for help."A-Actually D-dear...I'd like it if...y-you'd give me your opinion as well.", Mirabelle mutters shyly averting her gaze and fidgeting.'Et tu, Moon pie', Caleb lamented internally before giving a weak sigh and begrudgingly saying, "Fine...I'll...give my best input.""Yay! Oh, Chief, do you think this would look good on me? ", Lyca enthusiastically holds a small of grey and pink lace panties with a puppy face on it. She playfully stretched it with her clawed thumbs, "It's so stretchy-Woops!", she utters accidentally flinging it in Caleb's face with it clinging to his chest.Mirabelle covered her mouth hiding her blush as Caleb deadpaned at Lyca before peeling it off and handing it back to Lyca.Caleb inhales composing himself, "Yes, Lyca. I believe they would look adorable on. Please never do that again.""Really?", Lyca grins tail wagging happily almost completely ignoring the last of his comment, "Mira, let's find more like this that Chief will like!"Caleb tensed up nervously before hearing a few female shoppers whispering and giggling from behind them."Ly-don't say it like that and not so LOUD.", Caleb growled the last part through clenched teeth feeling a sudden desire to ducktape her mouth shut.Mirabelle looked away pondering to herself her eyes fixated on a rack of lingerie designed for Centaur, 'T-that...Dear would like?", she blushes her mind starting to drift. Lyca grabs her by the hand snapping her out of her trance."Come on, let's check over here next!", Lyca stated dragging Mirabelle off.Mirabelle squeaks reluctantly following, "Lyca, please don't pull so hard."Caleb watches them leave before shaking his head with a sigh. He notice a couple human women staring at him skeptically."Hey. What going on?", Caleb greeted them awkwardly before they hastily turned around resuming their shopping. He gives a lengthy sigh, "Where the hell are the store clerks when you need'm?"More time passed, for Caleb it felt like hours, before the girls found another bunch of clothing that appealed to them. Mirabelle picking some purple and black double D cup bras, a few lingerie, lace panties for her front nethers, and specially designed tights for Centaur. Lyca picked grey and blue lace boyshorts and a few lace panties. She wasn't very interested in many of lingerie but she did find some latex underwear that caught her eye. Or bras, but that was because she finds them uncomfortable and so doesn't wear them; a fact Caleb honestly didn't need to know.They found the changing room where they decided to try on some of their outfits; with Caleb as the reluctant judge. Outfit after outfit, they came out modeling and doing little poses and he would praise them on how great they looked. Mirabelle's were sharp and elegant but laid back and really brought out her eyes and hair. Not to mention, they accentuated her hourglass shape ridiculously well. For Lyca, as he suspected, those shorts she picked were dangerously little! It was debatable to even CALL some of them pants; more like butt floss. They formed perfectly around her tight round butt and accentuated her shapely thighs and slender frame. He honestly had to keep him from staring too much and getting lost somewhere he may not come back from.He sat on a body length stool with side mirrors that's in every women's clothing department for some reason directly in front of the changing rooms. Mirabelle in the door in front of him and Lyca one door down to his right. The stack of clothes divided for Lyca and Mirabelle's clothing already tried on. Now they were trying one their under and lingerie. He silently prayed to whatever god that was listening they wouldn't need his input."~Second thing second, don't you tell me what you think that I could be~", Caleb quietly sung to the song playing on the intercom trying to distract himself. He took out his phone and began checking his email for anything interesting.Meanwhile, in the dressing room, Mirabelle was observing every inch of the lingerie she chose. She ran her hand along the light purple transparent skirt that connected to her lower waist covering part of her horse half admiring it's silky texture. She guided her hands to the purple strap-on lace panties on her front crotch. She cups her breasts in the strapless dark purple lace bra, which fit perfectly, and pushed them up making her flesh jiggle slightly. She looked at herself from all angles in the mirrors hardly believing it was even her. She looked...sexy; ever her breasts looked bigger. Suddenly, a thought occurred to her. What would Caleb say? Would he think it looks good on her? He's right outside, she could just ask him...but...what would be his reaction?Her mind started to fantasize the scenario.***'Caleb steps inside her dressing room, gazing in amazement and longing at her alluring appearance. Mirabelle nervously shifts her gaze away. He grabs her shoulders forcing her to gaze in his brown passionate eyes."You are absolutely ravishing Moon pie. I don't think I can restrain any longer.""B-but Dear, right here in public? W-w-what if someone catches us?""Bullocks to them! Let them watch how a man loves his woman!", he fervently stated before attacking her flesh."Haaahh! Oh, Dear!"***Back in reality, Mirabelle was giggling to herself and blushing beat red holding her face in a swooning fashion while her body swayed happily and tail excitedly whipped about. The mirrors around her began fogging up with heat.Caleb looked up from his phone noticing the faint giggling sound coming from Mirabelle's door."What the hell?", he says to himself wondering if she's ok in there. He was about to get up and knock on her door when..."Uhhh, Chief? Can you help me, please?", called Lyca from inside her dressing room. Caleb recoiled at first before apprehensively approaching."W-what's up? You ok in there?", Caleb spoke into the door."No, ergh, something's wrong...with these shorts? Can you help me?", Lyca whimpered."I-Woul-shouldn't Moon pie be helping you with...", Caleb stopped when her heard Mirabelle squeal to herself disjointedly giggling to herself. Seriously, is she alright? Caleb was about to knock on her door to see what going on with her, when Lyca called him."Please, Chief. Erhhh...I need your help, it really hurts.", Lyca pleaded.'really hurts?!', Caleb thought becoming worried. She's in pain? What the hell? Caleb desperately looked around, STILL finding no sales associates in sight. Where the fuck are the department staff when you need'm?!"Haaa fuck my life.", Caleb softly curses nervously facing the dressing room door, "Ok...i-i'm...coming in."Caleb places his hand on the latch and inhaled mentally preparing himself. He gently opened the door. He peaks inside and sees Lyca sprawled on the floor struggling to remove a pair of jean hot pants."They won't come off! It's too tight!", Lyca whimpers with pleading puppy eyes.Caleb pauses and blushes watching her squirm and flail her butt around. He shakes his head trying to focus before asking, "how...how did you even get them on to begin with?""It wasn't hard at first and was gonna to take'em off because they were too tight. But then the metal thing got stuck and now they're pinching and squeezing everything too hard and it hurts." , Lyca whines shifting uncomfortably even biting the shoulder strap of her blue tank top, "please get it off!"Caleb jaw drops in shock and his brain struggled to process the situation. He looks into her pleading Amber yellow eyes. He pinches the bridge between his nose and eyes and audibly groans in frustration, "Fine"He closes the door behind him and crouches beside Lyca and gently pets one of her ears causing her motions to cease momentarily, "Relax...now...turn over."Lyca relaxes a bit giving him a quizzical look, "Chief?""Turn over...i'll...help get them off.", he reluctantly says trying not to analyze his words too much. Lyca does as told still wincing from the uncomfortably tight garments. She lays on her back, tail flat on the floor, hands and legs facing upwards. Caleb positions himself over her, recoiling as she spreads her black fuzzy legs wide revealing the burgundy cloth tightened firmly around her thighs so much it looks to be cutting off circulation. His face heats up realizing he could make out the outline of her nethers through the fabric. Again, too damn little!He inhales sharply, "Ok now...don't move, alright? I'm...gonna try and unstuck the zipper.", he utters reaching his trembling hand towards her inner thighs. She simply nods watching in anticipation and discomfort. She shudders feeling the top of his hands graze her skin. Caleb gulp his fingers inches away from her privates. Her tail furiously twitches and swipes against his lower stomach. He grabs holds of her hips to hold he steady causing her to gasp in surprise before working the zipper on shorts."Ah! Chief, wait, if you move it too much it pinches!", Lyca yelped beginning to squirm. Caleb tries to keep her steady becoming more uncomfortable and trying desperately to avoid touching her delicate flower."Gah, will you please stop moving?" I trying to find where the damn zipper-", Caleb says before noticing where teeth failed to intersect the zipper, "Wait, I think I got it. I just to...adjust thisss part up and...", Caleb says yanking the hem up a bit for better leverage only to make the fabric tighten around her clit."Hyaaa!", Lyca yelps blushing suddenly closing her thighs around his hands. Caleb flinched trying to withdraw only to lurch forward pressing his face onto her soft, furry legs."Ahckk! Lyca, let go of my hands!", Caleb stated feeling her tight but warm and soft thigh press against him."I-I'm sorry Chief! You moved so suddenly and...and it pinched against my special place. P-please hurry I feel all weird and tingly down there now!", Lyca yelps blushing in embarassment as Caleb cringed feeling her womanhood rubbing against his fingers. His blood pressure skyrockets."Too much information! And don't you think I'd like to get this over with?! Now let go of my hands!", Caleb stated trying to pull free. She arches her back at his motion against her region."I-I can't! My body's not listening!", Lyca whimpers her body shaking.Caleb feels heat building from her loins and decides enough was enough, "Fuck it!", he says shifting his hands gripping her both sides of her thighs making her gasp. She yelps before freezing in shock as her forcefully spreads her legs wide. Lyca lays there staring in anticipation with her paws posted up like a puppy on it's back. Even her tail ceased it's motions as he took a moment to compose himself. He notices her hips are beginning to lose color around the lining of the shorts. How tight are these damn shorts?! Seeing his objective through, he grabs her shorts and quickly unbuttons them. He finally where the teeth had broken and grabs the zipper before yanking it. Lyca snaps back to reality and once again starts flailing....outside...A skinny brunette human woman wearing jeans, black belly shirt with the word 'feminist' on it is walking with a liminal woman with very large hands and feet with flowers growing from the, pointy ears, a ox-like tail, and wearing a frilly green dress. The top of which barely contained her large breasts. A troll."I don't know Rachel, you really think I could pull this off? What if someone laughs at me?", says the troll with a worried tone."Come on, Mabel. You have to be more confident in your appearance. It doesn't matter what anyone, ESPECIALLY some boorish man thinks.", Rachel assures, "Come on, there's the dressing room. Let's see how great you look."The troll, named Rachel, nods. As they approached the dressing rooms, they could make out strange bumping and voices coming from one of them."What is that?", Rachel says as Mabel makes an 'I don't know' expression. They get closer and could hear the voices of two people. A woman...and a man."Will you stop squirming? You're making this harder than it should.", the man growls."It's so tight! Your claws keep scraping near my special place!"Rachel and Mabel step away from the door with shocked expressions. Rachel curses see that the door locks from the inside. Rachel then gets An idea....in the dressing room...Caleb was seconds away from losing his damn mind. These shorts haven't budged an inch despite him managing to get the zipper all the way down. And what's worse..."Alright Chief, let's try it this way. I'll hold onto this while you pull'em down!", Lyca confidently stated bent over holding the wall bench with her butt raised up and tail erect giving a good eye full of her doggy daisy dukes. Caleb groans in exasperation at the absurdity of the situation."Ahgghhh fine, but don't move!", Caleb stated before hesitantly grabbing her sides. She shudders at his touch as he hooks his fingers on the hems. He pulls them glad to see they were finally budging bud horrified that her grey panties were now showing. He shuts his eyes looking away as he careful pulls them down; making out the shape of her tight but smooth rear."Haahh that's it Chief, they're almost off. Keep going-", Lyca happily stated with a blush before he interrupted."PLEASE don't talk. I'm not here right, I'm not doing this, I am sliding weights off of two parallel poles at the gym because that makes more sense than this!", Caleb stated firmly eyes still closed. He had passed her skin and starting to feel fur. He was glad this...situation was almost over until...Click. The door of the dressing room unlocks.It bursts open and Caleb freezes and jaw drops horror to see three women staring at him in shock and disgust while he halfsquatted with Lyca pants halfway down her legs."GET YOUR PAWS OFF HER YOU PIG!", the brunette woman stated.Caleb jumps up backing away as Lyca straightens up looking back at the strange humans curiously then finishing pulling the shorts off.At that moment, Mirabelle emerges out of her room startled by the shouting wearing a purple satin negligee that double as a Centaur cloak, "Dear?! What wrong?""Come here miss.", the brunette woman took Lyca by the hand pulling her out to the latter's added confusion. A liminal woman with big hands tended to Lyca while the brunette turned to Caleb with a hateful glare."I'm calling the police! I'm calling the police!", says a woman who's wearing what appears to be this stores uniform with a 'Manager' on the nametag."W-Wait, holl up I know this looks bad but I can ExplAAAAAAGHHHHHHHHHHHH OH GOD MY EYES OH GOD!", Caleb hollered in pain as the woman maced him. He falls back hits the mirrors with a thud sitting on the bench cradling his poor eyes and screaming in pain. Lyca eyes widen in shock and Mirabelle jumps hearing her host scream.The brunette woman rushes in and starts beating on Caleb, "Fucking, piece of shit, male garbage.", she curse as Caleb tries desperately to protect himself by guarding his face."Chief!" "Dear!" Lyca and Mirabelle exclaimed simultaneously."Miss please it's ok, your safe n-", the troll lady comforts before Lyca interrupts.Mirabelle rushes on the scene with distressed, "Stop, what are you doing to him?!""Let me go you fat handed...!", Lyca snarl before stomping hard on the trolls foot making said troll release her while she held her foot in pain. Lyca rushes the human attacking Caleb grabbing her off him, punching her in the stomach, then throwing her to throwing out of the room to the ground. Lyca snarled lunging at her when the troll lady grabs her pinning her arms to the side while Lyca knashed her jaws and thrashed to get loose."Hello, Hello police we need help, there was a possible attempt rape and now a dog liminal woman just attack a human woman...", the store manager spoke on the phone.Mirabelle rushes into the dressing room finding Caleb on the floor rocking side to side holding his face and bawling , "Caleb! Caleb, are you alright dear?!""NO!", Caleb shouted in anguish....1 eventual resolution to huge but hilarious misunderstanding later..."So, if we got this right...this man, Mr. Bizzell, was helping his homestay, Ms. Kessler...remove a pair of shorts that didn't fit her. Then you, with no proof, thinking he was assaulting her, maced and assaulted HIM . Then, assaults YOU, for assaulting her host. Making this...one giant assault spiral! Is our assessment correct?", Said the female officer to Rachel. The two Mon agents step away finish doing first aid.Rachel rubbed her bandaged cheek with Mabel beside her for support, "Yes...officer...that's kind of how it went down.", she says looking away refusing to look at any of them."You do realize all of this could've been avoided if you hadn't jumped to conclusions? You can't just go around beating on people, you could've seriously hurt him.", The female officer stated.Rachel reluctantly looks at Caleb and the girls. Mirabelle eying her cautiously while remaining close to Caleb, Lyca glaring at her with arms crossed, and Caleb glaring with red puffy eyes, bruise on cheek, and cut on his arm."Plus, under normal circumstances, we'd have to charge Ms. Kessler for attacking a human.", The human male Mon agent stated as Lyca gave him an incredulous look and was about to say something when he continues, "but...she did so in the defense of her host. Which in accordance with Article 17 section 13-C, ' Should their host be put in danger, ICEP students may use any means to defend them from harm' so charges won't be filed against her in this scenario. All that remains really is if Mr. Bizzell wishes to press charges.""Hell yes!", Caleb stated with a hint of venom. Rachel tenses as Mabel wears a panicked expression."Alright then, Ma'am you are under arrest for the assault of Caleb Bizzell.", the female cop says as she turn a shocked Rachel around slapping handcuffs behind her before reading her rights."W-wait! Please, sir she didn't mean it. She was only thought someone was being attacked and she wanted to protect them. Rachel just didn't think, but she's a good person.", Mabel drops to her knees in front of Caleb, with Lyca and Mirabelle watching closely, clasping her hands in a begging fashion, "Please, she's all I have. Nobody else took me in but her. She's all I have. Please." Mabel pleads slightly as Rachel looks back with somber expression.As Caleb stares at the troll woman, he feels a genuine, caring aura emanating from her along with the soothing scent of flowers; all of which causing his anger to wain more and more. He looks at Rachel in contemplation seeing the sorrow in her eyes. He looks to Mirabelle then Lyca. The former unsure what to do and the latter still angry but starting to feel guilty. He lets out an exasperated sigh."Hang on!", Caleb stated as the officer stopped in her tracks with Rachel turning to Caleb while everyone else stared in anticipation, "I'd...like to...drop all charges."Mabel grinned ecstatically, "OH THANK YO-""IF", Caleb interrupted, "She apologizes to me AND my homestays.", Caleb glares at Rachel.Rachel mutters disgruntled at the idea before flinching as the officer pull on her handcuffs. She reluctantly faces Caleb and utters lowly, "I'm sorry.""What was that? Sorry, couldn't make that out.", Caleb says with his hand to his ear.Rachel grits her teeth, "I said I'm sorry! Alright?! I'm sorry...for macing and attacking you. I'm sorry for putting your homestays through all of this.""As that good enough Mr. Bizzell?", asked the officer.Caleb sighs, "Yeah...good enough."The officer uncuffs Rachel who begins rubbing the soreness from her wrists eying Caleb with contempt."You're very lucky miss. I hope you realize that?", The officer says to Rachel who looks away. The two Mon agents approach the officer and they turn to Mabel and Rachel."Miss if you and your host would come with us we would like to record your testimony of your host actions.", The Four armed dark skinned Mon agents says."Wait, what about our clothes?", Mabel inquired to the small stack of dresses behind her."We'll keep them for you. Don't worry.", says the manager of the store."Thank you, oh one more thing.", Mabel says pulling off a few odd looking flowers from her head then hands them to Caleb, "These can be boiled down into a salve to help your eyes and wounds heal."Mirabelle takes them from her, "Ah, thank you so much.", Mabel nods to her understanding.With that, the officer and Mon agents escorted the two out of the store. The manager of the store turns to Caleb and the others."Sir, I am so sorry that you-""Oh save it!", Caleb interjected, "What kinda store are you running where you can barely find some goddamn service?!""I-I'm sorry sir, we're just a bit understaffed at the moment. Please, let me make it up to you and your homestays. 45% discount on everything your buying today.", The Manager says apologetically.Caleb thinks on it, "Alright, sounds good. Don't expect us to come back to THIS shop any time soon. And point me to a restroom.""I understand. I'm so sorry for all of this."...Caleb and the girls paid for clothes they bought and left the shop. Caleb held two armfulls of bags with Mirabelle and Lyca walking on either side of him. Both of them worriedly gazing at his bitter expression which hasn't changed since they left the shop."D-Dear...are your eyes still bothering you? W-we could rest for a while.", Mirabelle says"Yeah...a-and let us carry some of those. You've done plenty for us.", Lyca addedCaleb sighs, "It's fine girls. That whole experience just took a bit put of me but my eyes don't hurt as much anymore. But...still keep close. I washed my eyes out but everything is still pretty blurry."Lyca ears fold sadly to her head, "I'm so sorry Chief, if I didn't need your help to take sh-""Ah-dadadadada don't...say that out here. Besides, what done is done let's just move on.", Caleb interrupted her not wanting to draw anymore unnecessary attention.Suddenly, a thought occurs to Mirabelle, "That's another thing Dear? W-Why were assisting Lyca w-with...that?", she says in a panicked, hurt, and skeptical tone."Didn't seem to have much choice. There wasn't another girl nearby that could do it in my stead.", Caleb stated before shooting a questioning glare, "Now a follow-up question, what about you Moon pie? I wanted to ask you to do it but I heard you making weird sounds in the dressing room. What were you doing in there?"Lyca raises an eyebrow as well in a 'hey, yeah' fashion.Mirabelle flinches blushing red as a tomato, "I-I-I-I was uhm...uhhh...I...", she stutters hiding her steaming face in her hands.Caleb sighs, "Ok, ok, it's fine all that is over now. And hey, we ended up spending less on clothes, so how about we chill over at Kami House?"Mirabelle peaks up through her hands a smile starting to form.Lyca tilts her head, "What the hecks a Kami...House?""You'll love it, trust me.", Caleb answers.As they were walking, Caleb notices a small fireworks stand setting up near entrance of the complex.'Heh, 4th of July came quick this year. Maybe I'll take Moon Pie and Lyca somewhere, it could be fun. Certainly better than this crap I went through today.', Caleb thought assuredly.Narrator sidenote: ...oof.WR: Wow, this got a little chaotic near the end. Btw, did you guys know that Mirabelle was originally going to be a Troll? I changed it because I thought it wasn't exotic enough.K, PEACE FAM!

    Chapter 22: The Proposal( part 2)"HAVE YOU LOST YO GODDAMN MIND?!", Caleb spouted at Sterling while the girls visibly jumped from his sudden outbursts."I wouldn't say so, but please use your inside voice Mr. Bissell. I'm standing right here.", Sterling says rubbing his ear with one finger as Filo nervously peeked from behind his shoulder having been startled. Mirabelle was utterly shocked at his proposal and struggled to even comprehend why something like this is happening. Lyca and Camilla, especially the latter, were wide-eyed in anticipation and contemplation. The Zyklons each appeared interested in the strange turn of events."It's...Bizzell.", Caleb growled between his teeth glaring at Sterling, "And this is MY house, I will talk as loud as I damn well please! So I'll ask again. Have you...LOST...your goddamn mind if you think we're going to go along with this bullshit scheme of yours?!"Sterling gave an exasperated sigh but composed himself as he was already prepared for this hurtle, "Maybe. Maybe not. If wanting what's best for you and others like you is me losing my mind, then maybe I have lost my goddamn mind. A small sacrifice for progress if I say so myself.""Progress?! Turning us into a trial experiment for a ludicrous proposal you call progress?! You have-""Dear!"Caleb was about to retort before Mirabelle called out to him. He could feel her lightly tug his shirt. He turned to Mirabelle's gentle eyes as she guided him to take a step back. Caleb's sighs his anger waning a bit as he obeyed but kept glaring at Sterling. Mirabelle focused on Sterling."What exactly do you mean what's best for US?", Mirabelle inquired as Camilla and the others turned their attention towards her, "You make it sound as though...you expect us to do this."Sterling withdraws slightly then pensively looks off to the side, "Well...from what Filo tells me, you all seem perfect for the role. I'm not exactly forcing you all to do this.""We just so happen to be in a position where we HAVE to comply. In other words, you're giving us an ultimatum.", Mirabelle stated somberly. Caleb shook his head in disgust as Lyca stared at worriedly. Ein and her sisters gave thoughtful expressions realizing they were in a similar boat."It's more complicated than that! But, I suppose that is also at the core of my proposal.", Sterling reluctantly admitted."So that's it? In exchange for sweeping the girls actions and me bribing government agents, I have to get married to, not ONE, but all of my houseguests. Despite KNOWING I'm a relationship with one of them already? Is that what you're telling me?!", Caleb stated in disgust and anger.Sterling sighs crosses his arm and leans against the counter, "Again, it's more COMPLICATED than that. This is about giving hope to other people and giving you a chance to be crucial part of something amazing. Having whatever previous misdemeanors expunged is just a bonus."Sterling then gaze a sincere look at him and Mirabelle while resolutely placing his fist to his chest, "And don't assume for a moment that I don't respect your newfound love between you and Ms. Marequine. I had a feeling ever since I introduced you to her, you two would make a beautiful couple."Caleb and Mirabelle blushed glancing at each other. Caleb wanted to stay angry. He was still angry, but he could tell Sterling truly meant every word. He then gave Sterling a serious look."That's great, but have you given any consideration for Lyca and Camilla? You really think they're ok with this?!", Caleb stated gesturing to the girls respectively. Suddenly, Lyca stood up."Actually...I am Chief.", Lyca stated with a determined look warranting shocked stares from Caleb, Mirabelle, Camilla and the Zyklons( particularly Zwei). Sterling paused before giving a small grin in relief silently thanking her."W-What?!", Caleb and Mirabelle stated simultaneously."Well, yeah why not?", Lyca shrugged, "I kinda like the idea.""I'm not surprised.", Sterling added, "Werewolves are among the races that practice multi-spousal marriage.""Yep, it's pretty common for packs in the wild. When there are more females than males, the Alpha male would have several other females to mate with to ensure keeping the pack filled with strong pups.", Lyra stated before her grin faded and she interlocked her fingers with a dejected expression, "The Alpha female gets to choose which females though. Usually the ones she actually likes."Lyca notices her Zwei and the others staring at her before perking up, "B-but yeah, it's no big deal where I'm from. Plus, the fairy girl is right. I really, really like you, Chief!", she finishes with light blush on her toothy grin.Caleb and Mirabelle stared flabbergasted and unsure how to respond."Miss Kessler's species isn't the only one in your care that shares this practice Mr. Bizzell. Why, Ms. Sartana's species also practices multi-spousal marriage.", Sterling said gesturing to Camilla who immediately shot him a distasteful glare.Mirabelle turned an inquisitive look toward Camilla. Caleb wasn't too surprised. By what Camilla's told him so far he kinda managed to piece some of her past together himself."Hey yeah, I remember you telling me you were married once Camilla. So...does that mean you used to be part of a, for lack of a better word, harem too.", Caleb says as Mirabelle and Lyca focused on her in intrigue."Uhh 'Multi-spousal marriage' ", Sterling corrected." You can dress it up all you want, I'm gonna call it what it is basically.", Caleb replied back as Sterling rolls his eyes.Camilla lets out a sigh with her hand to her hips, "That is right Senor.""Wait, really?! D-Did something happen?", Lyca inquired in concern."Nothing, I was in a very troublesome time in mi life and was given a chance to join a bandejos' clan. I did not have much choice at the time, so I accepted. It did not work out now I am here. Plain and simple.", Camilla stated obviously not wanting to talk about it."What...was it like? W-what was the man you we're married to like?", Mirabelle asked slightly embarrassed.Camilla face scrunched in anger, "It was tolerable at first, until I met the bastardo I was to become the 73rd wife to. Every moment with him was unbearably suffocating. I despise him.""Was it really that terrrible?", Lyca inquired, "Couldn't you have just left it was really that bad?""Wait! Did she say 73RD?!", Ein stated in shock."Afraid it's not that simple.", Sterling jumped ignoring Ein, "As I mentioned earlier, this plan is also meant to help races with a drastically declining birthrate. The Devil species is one of a few that have a staggeringly low pregnancy statistic. The species appears to suffer from an abnormally high infant mortality rate where 3 out of 5 pregnancies results in a miscarriage. That's IF they can get pregnant at all since most females suffer from fertility issues. What's more, out of the total population, only 3% of Devils are born male. It's now at the point where Devils are becoming an endangered species. Elder Devils like Ms. Sartana are, by far, the rarest of the species with numbers only in the several hundreds worldwide!"Caleb jaw dropped, "Holy shit! Are you serious right now?! Camilla, is that really true?""Unfortunately, yes Señor. It's always been difficult for bodies to conceive life. We are beings of discord formed by chaotic energy that sustains our existence. It's energy that consumes all life; including ones growing within ourselves.", Camilla spoke somberly gliding her hand across her stomach, "It's this ability that allows my kind to roam this earth for centuries and grant us the power to defend against our enemies.""E-Enemies?", Mirabelle inquired."Jes. Filthy Angels, like that one at the restaurante, who've hunted, killed, and enslaved mi gente for millennia. Humans that see us as spawns of Hell despite not being affiliated with THOSE demons whatsoever.", Camilla explained earning as Mirabelle looked at her with understanding. She knows what kind of life that is."So...why the whole...harem thing?", Caleb asked not wanting it sound too offensive."Sigh, since we knew our kind would always be in danger and our numbers weren't getting any bigger, many of us decided to form clans hidden from our enemies. Whatever males we were lucky enough to find were to breed with as many females as possible in order to keep the bloodline flowing with pure blooded Devils and maximize the chances of successful births. Over time it became common place to find a single male with dozens of mates to breed with.", Camilla cast a frustrated gaze at a window, "It was fine until the males of our kind started realizing their importance to our race and became self-entitled, unrefined, vulgar assholes! They once treated us with respect now we're just toys to them!"Caleb and the others were shocked by her outbursts.Camilla turned to Sterling with an annoyed look, "So do not call our lifestyle 'marriage'! What are our options when most of the world is our enemy!",The room went silent for a moment. Sterling looked away in shame while Mirabelle, Lyca and the Zyklons eyes Camilla with varying degrees of sympathy or concern. Caleb could already feel the tension growing as he looked toward the she-devil who's vicious demeanor had dissolved to sorrowfully frown.Caleb stands from the couch facing towards Camilla, "Camilla...I'm-WE'RE sorry.", he shoots a quick look at Sterling, " We didn't know Devils had it so bad. On top of that, everything you went through, it makes sense why you hate humans maybe the world. I get it, you're not alone, ok?"Camilla looks up at him for a moment then away, "I-I know Senor.""Yeah, and considering your experience I know you definitely wouldn't go for no "Multi-spousal marriage" ", Caleb mockingly emphasized to Sterling's chagrin. Lyca gave a look of disappointment while Mirabelle discretely breathed a sigh of relief."A-Actually Senor... I would not mind giving it a try.", Camilla admitted."Exactly, just what I've been-come again?!", Caleb finished his eyes widening in shock. Lyca happily perks up with her tail wagging excitedly while Mirabelle froze in shock and horror. The Zyklons appeared even more intrigued by this turn of events."I know what I said earlier but that was because I truly hated the one I was with. I've only known the cruelty of the men of mi kind and I never bothered with human men that naturally hated and feared me. So I wouldn't know what it'd be like with a human.", Camilla cheeks flushes a darker shade of brown, "But...if it's ju Senor... I'd be fine with sharing you with Senorita Mirabelle and Lyca. I love you Senor and I am willing to do anything to be with you."Caleb and Mirabelle were floored unable to find words to describe how insane all of this was. Caleb glanced at Sterling to see him and his fairy friend sitting with smug 'told ya' grins."Yay!", Lyca cheered leaping over the couch wrapping Camilla in a hug almost knocking her down before regaining her footing, "I knew you weren't going to give up!"Camilla giggled as she petted the top of her head while Lyca nuzzled her ample bosom. Caleb blushed slightly ignoring the scene. Instead refocusing his anger on this entire situation."Oh come on! Are you kidding me?!", Caleb stated."Mr. Bizzell, please, I know this may seem strange but try to understand that you are in a unique but entirely plausible circumstance. I mean you more than fit the criteria for this type of marriage. Try to be more open about the idea-", Sterling before Caleb jumped in."Imma stop you right there. I'm a very open minded person! However, there is a fine line being open minded and being fucking insane.", Caleb retorted"Caleb is right Sterling! Y-You can't drop this on us and expect us to just accept this! ANY of this!", Mirabelle added clenching the couch cushion and trembling.Sterling paused for a second, "I know...this is all very sudden but let's not be so hasty. Give it a bit more thought and maybe you'll see it's not so bad.""You are like a broken record.", Caleb facepalmed then turned to the Zyklons for help, "Ein, Zwei, Drei? Can you guys back us up? Tell him this harem plan of his is ridiculous.""Oh good, he acknowledged we still exist.", Drei commented which Caleb ignored.The sisters gave each other inquisitive looks and shrugs. Ein seemed a bit apprehensive about answering, so Zwei spoke up first."In all honesty, uh sir, we really don't have much say in the matter. But, personally, I...see nothing wrong with it. Having multiple wives isn't so bad. Hell, our parents sure made it work.", Zwei said as Caleb jaw dropped in defeat."Wait a minute.", Lyca jumped in, "Are you saying that Karmal Tai chi have packs with an Alpha male and female too!""Umm...Kamai-ta-chi have a tradition where three females, typically siblings, share one male between them. It's actually quite efficient since the male to female birth ratio of our species is 1:3. And...as Zwei eloquently put it, our family life was healthy and stable with a few hiccups now and then. Our father was a bit strict but he was also very loving towards us and our birth mothers.", Ein smiled fondly to herself reminiscently, "I miss him.", she finishes softly."Papa was always patient and understanding towards us. Not laughing the time Zwei shaved her head bald to look like him for his birthday.", Drei says as Zwei tenses up blushing furiously in embarassment at the memory, "Or being supportive when Ein was helping Mother Dai Lee remodel the washroom and got her butt and tail stuck to the-""OK!", Ein and Zwei shouted with desperately both covering Drei's mouth."I think they get idea sis, Gods!", Ein growled still blushing in embarassment. Drei did an "Oh well" gesture with her mouth still covered.Caleb and the others took a moment to process everything they were told; with a few letting their imagination wonder on the image of Zwei bald-headed.Sterling clears his throat getting their attention, "Ahem, well there you have it Mr. Bizzell. You more than fit the criteria for this proposal and even your bodyguards have provided a good argument for the sustainability of a multi-spousal marriage. Again, I only wish for you to at least think it over."Caleb wore a look of confusion and panic as he noticed Lyca, Camilla, even the Zyklons staring at him expectantly. What the hell was he supposed to say?! This has to be a dream! A weird one that Moon Pie hasn't driven away yet, "I...this is...all of this is just...", Caleb words got caught in his throat when he momentarily locked eyes with Camilla's hopeful gaze. His heart started to race much to his annoyance."Why?", Mirabelle softly stated her fingers gripping the couch firmly, "What is wrong with all of you?!"Sterling, Camilla and the others focused on the Centaurs sudden outburst."Alpha males?! Harems?! Multiple wives?! Is all of this really so normal for all of you?!", Mirabelle looked around them incredulously, "W-Why are Dear and I the only ones not ok with this?", she finishes her body trembling. Caleb rubbed her back trying to comfort her as Camilla and Lyca gave worried looks."It's...well it's just how things go for us Mira. It's part of our traditions.", Lyca says."Si, and sadly, it's quite necessary for some of us.", Camilla added before a thought occurs to her, "Do your people not have a tradition like that?"Mirabelle pauses, "N-No! We...we don't...share our mates.", she says in an almost forlorn voiceLyca and Camilla gave looks of understanding but also disappointment."Ahh, so Nightmares practice monogamy as well? Interesting.", Sterling says intrigued."Well...not...exactly.", Mirabelle reluctantly admits earning confused stares from everyone in the room."Hang on, wait. You JUST said you don't share mates. So it's just your mother and father, right?", Zwei inquired as Caleb felt Mirabelle withdraw slightly. His concern deepening."I-I have a mother but...I never met my father.", Mirabelle sadly replies the speaks in a low, embarassed tone, "I doubt he even knows either of us even exist."Caleb, Camilla, and Lyca's concern grew to new levels and Sterling and the Zyklons appeared more intrigued and slightly saddened by her words."H-How is that possible?", Camilla questioned."Was it...like a one-night stand situation or...?", Zwei inquired as Ein shot her a disapproving glare."That's rude Zwei, you can't just ask her something like that!", Ein stated."L-Look, please it's not-", Mirabelle pleaded only to be interrupted."It can happen! Maybe the guy just had a few too many and-""HEY!", Caleb shot a Zwei making her jump."THAT'S ENOUGH!", Mirabelle shouted trying to hold back her tears. The room went quite as they were taken aback by her sudden outburst, "I...I don't want to discuss this. I just don't.", she says he voice filled with sorrow."I-I'm sorry.", Zwei apologized ashamed of herself."It's ok, Moon pie. You don't have to. We understand it's a touchy subject for you.", Caleb says clasping her hand in his. She looks up sadly, only slightly comforted by his warmth before quickly returning to the REAL subject for today.She softly inhales, "So...I don't understand a multi-spousal marriage when I barely understand a monogamous marriage. That being said, I can't allow this. Caleb is MY heart and I shouldn't have to split it with anyone."Caleb felt relieved and glad to see his girlfriend take a stand for their relationship. Then he looked around the room his heart started to ache seeing Lyca's ears drooped sadly, Camilla despondently sighing with a small frown, even Sterling, Filo, and the Zyklons particularly disappointed looks.Lyca steps up her tail between her legs, "B-but Mira, i-it's not...I...w-we...", she struggled before feeling Camilla's hand on her shoulder. She looks to the demoness' half-hearted grin who gestures for her to take over."Señorita, a heart cannot be split. It can either break...or grow. Ju have seen it yourself, Señor is capable of caring for all of us. No matter why it had to happen, Ju are no longer the only one with feelings for him. I and Señorita Lyca, we love him De same way as you.", Camilla finished."Heh, isn't that terrific? Tell me, have either of you even considered if Dear loves YOU the same as he does me?! Dear cares about you, but he is in love with ONLY me!", Mirabelle protests gripping Caleb's arm tightly making him wince slightly at her shockingly strong grip. Caleb stayed silent watching with regret the somber expression on Camilla and Lyca's faces.Filo finishes whispering something in Sterling's ear. He then pivots his seat towards Mirabelle."Are you certain about that?", Mirabelle and the others turned a shocked gaze his way, "Because I did say situations like these happen more often than you'd guess; including hosts being romantically involved with more than one guest.", he then turns a knowing look towards Caleb; who shot an agitated glare, "This time is no exception."Caleb was about to retort before noticing Camilla and Lyca faces light up with hope and turning to him expectantly.Caleb's anxiety reaches new levels as his entire body tenses unable to even concentrate anymore. He was getting backed into a corner. He looks at Sterling and Filo, a combination of anger, fear, and despair wash over him. It gets worse when he heard Mirabelle's shocked and fearful whimpering next to him and a look of denial on her face.."N-no. It's not true. Y-you're only in love with me, you said so yourself. Tell me it's not true.", Mirabelle half-pleaded facing him with trembling eyes.Caleb turned to face her clasping her hands, "O-Of course it's not true! I love you and only you Moon pie!""Stoppppp it!", Filo shrieked before flying up into Caleb's face forcing the couple to split apart, "Stop denying it! You can push them down allllll you want but those feelings are real! I can see them plain as the wings on my back! You are in love with the demoness; and you love the big doggy as well! And it looks like, for the demoness, those feelings immerged recently!"Caleb mind went blank as he sat unable to find to say anything to defend himself; because deep down, he knew every word was true. Lyca and Camilla were utterly shocked by the revelation; Camilla especially couldn't believe her and had to pinch herself to make sure it wasn't a dream. Only for her claws to cut her skin which immediately healed as quickly as she made the wound."C-Caleb...?", Mirabelle shakily inquired her eyes full of dread. Caleb reluctantly turned to her and looked up, "D-Do you...you really...?"Caleb frowned at her before choking down a growing sob in his throat. "Yes...it's true.", he sadly admitted then hangs his head in shame, "I'm so sorry Moon pie."Mirabelle expression morphed to shock and sadness as every nerve in her body felt as if it has just been stabbed with a sharp needle. She couldn't believe the man she loved had feelings for the other women around him. It hurt. A lot.Camilla reached out wanting to say do something to make situation a little better but quickly and sadly withdrew. Lyca also do something to cheer them up but couldn't find the resolve to move. She looks to Zwei for what to do; who simply returns her own uncertain look.Filo returned to Sterling who feels the atmosphere in the room growing denser by the second. He looks regretfully at Mirabelle but straightens his collar and returns to his professional demeanor. He clears his throat and turns to Caleb, "Mr. Bizzell...all of this may seem overwhelming but you must understand that I wouldn't have chosen you If I knew you weren't the right person for the job. In your short time as a host, you've demonstrated remarkable skills and dedication towards your homestays. If it weren't for you, dozens maybe even hundreds of liminals would've continued to suffer in the shadows and be denied the rights that all people should have."Caleb didn't respond for a full minute and only sat in silence. Sterling sighed to himself and was about to speak again before Caleb stopped him."Sterling...", Caleb uttered as Sterling listened intently. He then noticed the rage that filled his eyes, "Please get the hell out of my house."Sterling was surprised by his words, "Mr. Biz-"Before he could finish, Caleb stomps over to front door and violently flings it open, "I said GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY HOUSE!"Camilla, Lyca and the Zyklons were stunned at how angry he was. A few of them, including Mirabelle, visibly jumped hearing his voice stilling come to terms with the sudden revelation. Sterling was surprised as well but tried to remain as professional as possible. Filo on the other hand."Hey! Youuu can't talk to him that way! Who do you th-!""ZIP IT, TINKER BELL! You leave too!", Caleb interrupted the fairy.Filo puffs her cheeks her entire body glowing bright red with anger, "WHY YOU...!"She was about to fly right at Caleb when Sterling put his hand right in front of her blocking her. She gave him an inquiring look to which he shook his head."Alright, we will your house Mr. Bizzell.", Sterling says plainly before turning a steel hard glare at Caleb, "But first, why don't we leave the girls alone for a bit? I'd like to have a word with you outside in private. Now.", the was a trace of venom at the end which Caleb picked up but didn't waver in the slightest."Tch, fine.", Caleb begrudgingly accepts. He then proceeds outside with Sterling leaving Mirabelle and the others alone....Mirabelle sat silent staring downwards in defeat. Lyca approaches cautiously from the side."M-Mira...please don't be sad. It's not-", Lyca says as her hands make contact with her shoulder."Don't touch me!" ,Mirabelle rips herself away glaring at Lyca with a face contorted in disgust. Lyca tensed and backs away in shock with her tail between her legs. She's never seen Mirabelle look at her like that. Camilla immediately steps up to Mirabelle non-threateningly yet asserting herself."Señora! Please just listen. We do not intend hurt ju, it is just-", Camilla before Mirabelle interupts."Just what?! You can finally have what you want and expect me to be fine with it?! T-to let you both take him from me?! Well bullocks to that!", Mirabelle's voice chokes into a sob at tears start flowing from her eyes, "Why...why are you guys so enthusiastic about this? Caleb said he was MY boyfriend. He told you that and you said you supported us. I thought we were truly opening up to each other. I thought you truly were my friends? Now that this is on the table, you both want him now too?!"Camilla and Lyca faces turned to remorse when they saw they very hurt look on her face. Ein and Zwei sat uncomfortably listening and wondering if they should step in or let them sort this out themselves. Drei was just returning to her seat with a another plate of cinnamon rolls and juice. As she sat back down, Ein immediately grabs a couple rolls and begins stress eating trying to cope."N-no, no Mira it's not like that at all! We do respect your relationship!", Lyca stated assuredly with sincerity in her eyes."That is right! Please understand, we also love Señor Caleb as much as ju do but that does not mean we do not respect what ju two have. We would never hurt that bond. That being said, I-we desire to form our own bonds with Señor Caleb. It is true I AM in love with him as well but that does not mean I do not mean I wish to take him from ju!", Camilla emphasizes placing her left hand on her chest solemnly."Me neither! I love Chief but I love you too! This whole harem whatchacallit just means we can be a real family!", Lyca proudly stated only to notice Mirabelle expression hadn't changed at all."But...but I thought we already were?", Mirabelle says weakly as Camilla and Lyca pause at her words,. She then resumes, "Dear and I care about all of you. Isn't that enough? We all just started really getting along. So why?"Camilla, Lyca and the Zyklons gave thoughtful or regretful expressions. Mirabelle lowers her head sadly."When did everything become so complicated? It used to be the just the two of us living out or days peacefully. But then, everything around us started to change...now I don't think we can ever go back.", Mirabelle sadly whimpers Iowering her head....Meanwhile outside...Sterling closes the door behind him before turning a cold glare at Caleb who stood on the walkway with a deep scowl. Sterling gestures Filo to stay out of this."What do you want Sterling?", Caleb inquires not even bothering being polite anymore."Well, for starters, I'd like to know who the hell you think you are? Forcing us out so rudely, you seem to forget where you stand.", Sterling replies also dropping the formality."Well I couldn't care less about standings at the moment. Right now, I THINK I'm the guy not going to be subjected to your pet project!""Is THAT what you think this is? Some hobby I'm doing on a whim?! I'm just trying to help you and the girls!", Sterling stated vehemently."How?! By making everything more complicated?! We were just fine. We managed to move past what happened that night and you came in and ruined it with your talk of multi-spousal marriage crap!", Caleb stated angrily."I didn't RUIN anything. I only presented it as an option. It's YOU acting belligerent!", Sterling firmly stated."Me ac-now you listen to me! I just told you what my standings on this are! I told you I only have eyes for ONE person in that house!", Caleb spat back.Sterling stepped up to him, "And what of the other two, huh? As I recall, Ms. Kessler and Sartana poured their hearts poured their hearts out to you and you seemingly don't even care! Don't their feelings matter?"Caleb recoiled for a moment for retorting, "You know that isn't true! I do care about them. But I'm only in love with Moon pie-"Sterling cuts him off, "Oh stop, you know that isn't true, FILO definitely knows it isn't true.", Caleb paused as Filo say on Sterling shoulder nodding in agreement with her arms crossed, "You have feelings for them too. Not just Ms. Marequine. Don't lie to yourself!"Caleb clenched his fists and bit his bottom lip unable to reply."It's not a bad thing.", Sterling replies in a calmer tone, There's no reason you can't be in love all of them. It's better than hurting them by making them watch you and Mirabelle everyday knowing they'll have that kind of relationship. And you'll hurt yourself and Mirabelle by bottling those feelings away until they one day explode and cause a far worse disaster.""Far worse?! I nearly died just last month to a bunch of gangsters. Whom by the way, could send ANYONE to kill me any day. I'm a social pariah at work now and have panic attacks if I so much as look at the goddamn hole in my chest!", Caleb exclaims clenching the side of his chest at Sterling, "Mirabelle even blamed herself for what happened to me, do you know that too?! I was finally able to help her move past it with her so we could both heal?! Why are you doing this to us?!", Caleb demanded.Sterling took a deep breath holding and controlling his anger and irritation at the young man, "Now, I want you to listen to me Mr. Bizzell. What happened that night was terrible and I'm sorry you were forced into that scenario and the aftermath that follows. But, you should also know YOU are not the only one suffering. A lot of good people died that night; including Sergeant Gibbs. A man I greatly looked up to as my mentor and friend!", Sterling ranted as Caleb opened his mouth to say something but was cut off, "And you're not the only one with scars from that night!", Sterling says lifting his shirt up slightly exposing this lower stomach. Filo covered her mouth in shock as Caleb also stared at the darken, root-like patterns where the metal shrapnel tore through his skin. Sterling then covers proceeding to tuck his shirt back in, "We're all still dealing with the pain kid. So stop acting like you have it worse than anyone."Caleb is silent in thought for a moment thinking of the families of the hotel check-in guy and others with family members killed by the Malones before looking up with a remorseful expression, "You didn't have to tell it like that. Mirabelle didn't need to know like that. You know you you're wrong, both of you."Sterling looks Filo, who nods agreeingly with a somber look, "I know. We're sorry, it wasn't intended to...come out that way."Caleb merely shakes his head lethargically."What are you going to do?", Sterling inquires."I...I need some time alone to think. I can't face them right now.", Caleb replies earning a concerned look from Sterling."You know that's too dangerous. The Malones-""Yeah, I know!", Caleb interrupts, "I also know the one who gave me this scar is getting executed today. Yet another person dying because of me. I'll be at the park just send one of the Zyklons with me, I don't care which.", Caleb says as he turns and leaves"W-wait! Mr. Bizzell! Mr. Bizzell!", Sterling calls out only for Caleb to ignore him as he left, "Gah, what the hell is with him?!""Heyyy, Sterling I think I should go with him. It's kinda my fault this haaappened and need to apologize!", Filo says zipping in front of his face with a concerned look on her tiny face.Sterling thinks on for a second, "Well...alright. Make sure you stay out of sight from anyone else though. And try to avoid getting caught by another bird again.""Thanks, and that was onnnne time! No yucky bird is gonna get me!", Filo tirades before making a face him before flying off.Sterling gives a tired sigh turning to the front door realizing he now has to deal with the students inside....Back inside...Camilla takes a seat next to Mirabelle as the latter shuffle her body slightly in the opposite direction to avoid looking at her. Camilla instantly picks up this isn't going to be easy."Senora, ju have every right to feel the way you do. Our people may have different beliefs of what is acceptable but I believe we can agree on matters of the heart. So let me put it out there: we both love the same man. Personally, I like the idea of each of us being with him.""Uhhhh, you're not including us too, right?", Ein inquires raising her hand."Yeahhh, this seems like a 'you guys' thing. I mean he's an ok dude but...""Ju two, hush.", Camilla gestures her hands like a duck closing it's bill before turning back to Mirabelle, "Now Senora, you know how we feel, tell me what ju think of this."Mirabelle remains quiet as her head lowered to floor. She then shakes her head sadly standing up from the couch, "I don't know what to think. All of this. It's too much all at once to take in! I...I just want to be alone right now.""M-Mira...", Lyca whimpers wanting to stop before Camilla beckons her against it."That is fine Señora. Take your time.", Camilla says standing up gently rubbing Mirabelle's shoulder. Mirabelle gives a quick thoughtful look before maneuvering past them. Lyca sadly steps to the side noticing Mirabelle quickly glance at her. They watched the Nightmare disappear into the hallway; the sound of her clopping hooves growing more faint before they hear a door close shut.Camilla crosses her arms and gives a deep sigh as her tail plaintively sways, "Mierda( Fuck)", she curses to herself. Lyca sits in the spot Mirabelle was previously pulling her knees to her chest and making sad canine sounds."Ghhrrgh why did I have to say that?! This is all my fault!", Lyca growls in regret. Zwei goes over to Lyca's side."Hey, come on now you didn't do anything wrong.", Zwei tried to assures her."Yes it is. I got too ahead of myself and overstepped! AGAIN! Gods I'm so dumb! They probably hate me now!", Lyca quivers as tears start forming."N-no they don't!", Zwei stated, "They're just having a hard time coping with this."That's right Ms. Kessler. You have to remember Mr. Bizzell is a human and their practices for mating are quite different from ours. Even now I still question the efficacies of single man-woman spousal pairs.", Ein added."Not to mention the emotional, financial, mental, physical, and borderline unreasonable standards they put themselves through before EVEN deciding to have a second date.", Drei comments, "But I'm sure it gets easier after marriage."Lyca then feels a hands on the top of her head and looks up curiously to see Camilla giving her a warm smile, " Do not worry novia, Señor and Señorita Mira care very deeply for ju. They could never hate you."Lyca gave a half smile then looks away thoughtfully, "Yeah...I-I know.", she utters softly before Zwei gives her reassuring pats on her shoulder.Ein was the next to chime in, "Yes, don't worry. I'm sure Agent Sterling is calming Mr. Bizzell down now and when he comes back in we can-", she was cut off by the sound of the front door opening. Each of the girls turned in it's direction to see Sterling walking in and closing the door. They were puzzled see but no sign of Caleb then notice to sour expression of Sterling's face."Where is Señor Caleb?", Camilla inquired."Hahhhh, well he's gone off in a huff.", Sterling says in annoyance sitting down at the counter massaging his temple.Camilla and Lyca gave worried looks wondering did they really make him that angry. The Zyklons each have different degrees of shock on their faces.Ein immediately gets to her feet with an incredulous and panicked expression, "Wait, he left? Alone?! With possible Malone assassins lurking anywhere?! Is he insane?!""Probably. Filo decided to go with him to apologize, but he did say to send one of you after him, doesn't matter who. You'll find him in Creekwood park. So which one of you is going?", Sterling inquires the Zyklons.Ein and her sisters looked between each other."Well I think I should go. I'll bring him back immediately and-""Ein, wait.", Drei interjected, " I think he'll be more cooperative if I go. You and Zwei should hold things down here.""Are you sure Drei? We can go together. It'd be safer that way.",Ein suggested."No, it's better if it's just me. You two still have to gaurd this house AND ours. Don't worry, if we're really in trouble I'll contact immediately. ", Drei emphasizes waggling her special MON standard issued smartphone."Well...ok. Be safe.", Ein relented."Don't say that, you'll jinx me.", Drei says before quickly leaving to find Caleb. The others watched her with Camilla and Lyca hoping she could help get Caleb back."And might I ask where is Ms. Marequine?", Sterling asks them."She went to her room sir. She...doesn't wish to socialize with the others at the moment.", Ein reported.Sterling sighs tiredly, "of course, yet another thing she and her host have in common. Hahhh this whole thing turned out worse than I thought.""So what now?", Lyca inquired."I don't know. Perhaps...this really was a bad idea. As stubborn as he is, I should have known he'd never go for it.", Sterling lamented. Lyca and the Zyklons went quiet but Camilla immediately stepped."No. That is not true.", Camilla says as the others focus their attention on her, "I believe it can work. We just need to help them understand."Sterling gave her a puzzled look, "How? You saw what happened when I-""That is because ju came across as forcing the idea on them idiota!", Camilla snapped at Sterling, " Of course they weren't going to listen if you intimidate them with talk of knowing everything we did and acting as the saviors for those like us. Personally, I could not care less about others in situations like ours, they are NOT US! That kind of pressure it is no wonder neither of them would even consider your little "proposal"! ", Camilla castigated him emphasizes the last part.Sterling goes quiet reflecting on what she said. Maybe he was being a little too pushy and putting to heavy a responsibility on them."But...how do we do that? I don't think Chief or Mira are gonna listen to us.", Lyca inquired in a doubtful tone."That is why we should work on Señorita Mirabelle first.", Camilla says as Lyca and the other eyes widened with interest, "The main reason Señor doesn't want to do it is because of his feelings for her. Buuuut...if she were more receptive to the idea, perhaps Señor would be as well."Lyca's ears perk up happily, "ohhh, yeah that's a good idea Cami.""Wait, how are you so sure it'll work?", Zwei started, "she seemed pretty adamant about not sharing her man with anyone else.""Not quite. I could tell her feelings were mostly hurt because she thinks the friendship we have with her was a lie and that Señor would love her less if he does go through with it.", Camilla explained, "I can imagine how hurt and confused she feels right now. However, I believe there's a chance we can cast he fears aside.""Hmm, now that I think about it, she didn't outright say she hated the idea. Then again her feelings of betrayal of going to be a like treading an open minefield. Do you even a plan for approaching her?", Ein asks.Camilla smirks confidently, "Do not worry. I am quite good at dealing with troubled young girls."Lyca perks up with a hopeful grin while Zwei and Ein nod to each other understandingly.Sterling was about to say something when his phone started ringing. He answers it, "Yes? ...What?! Why? What happened to Agent Stone?!...sigh fine I'll be over soon."Sterling hangs up before noticing the curious eyes staring at him as he quickly gathered his things together."Is...everything alright sir?", Ein asks with a worried tone."There's a host on Lurleen avenue who got into a bit of an argument with his homestay. It escalated out of control. Now a Scylla is screaming at him on the front lawn and half the street is flooded with water!", Sterling replies quite irritated heading towards the door then turning to them, "Are you guys going to be ok.""Jes Jes, just go. Let us handle this.", Camilla dismissely waves him off. He was about to reply before shaking his head deciding not to engage her, "I'll be later to check on you guys.", he says before closing the door behind him.Camilla rolls her eye before Ein enters her sight standing next to her hands on hips with skeptical look."So what exactly is your plan to convince Ms. Marequine?", Ein inquires as Lyca and Zwei have their attention fixated on Camilla.Camilla raises one finger with a "Well, it is actually quite simple."...Meanwhile, in the Creekwood Park...Caleb was walking along the bank of a small pond still fuming over the insanity that just went down. He picked up a few stones and began casting them at the shimmering waters to blow off steam while avoiding disturbing the flock of geese near the waters edge. He cursed with every stone he aggressively threw until he ran out. He then spotted a bench close by bank across cement pathway with a trees lining just behind them providing shade."Aggghh, goddamit. Fucking, fuuuck!", he cursed to himself plopping down on the bench and throwing his head back with his hands covering his face. A few curious passersbys stared at him before continuing on about their business choosing to ignore him. After a moment of deep breathing composing himself, he repositions himself to sit more comfortably, hands in lap and staring at the ground. He lifts his head looking around finally taking in the atmosphere around him. The pleasant warmth of the Summer morning sun shining down. The smell of freshly cut grass and funnel cakes from a food van near the park entrance. The sounds made by bleats from the flock of geese on the pond, and the gentle winds blowing made the atmosphere all the more relaxing. Not many people in the park this Sunday, save for a few children and their parents in the recreational playground or the occasional jogger or cyclist. Caleb inhales slowly; taking it all in, it was a beautiful morning. So why?"Why did things turn out like this?", Caleb asks no one in particular before rubbing his eyes. His thoughts flash to each of the girls and the hurt looks on their faces; especially Mirabelle, "Moon pie...girls...I'm sorry.", he laments burying his face in his palms."IIIII don't think they can here you all the way out here", came a voice startled Caleb into jumping, "Mayyyybe try getting closer?""Who said that?!", he stated frantically looking around before a Filo appeared fluttering in front of his face. He jumps back as she snickers with a playful toothy grin. He calms down and gives her annoyed and unamused glare, "Oh it you. What do you want?"Filo's smile vanishes and she lets out a sigh, "Ok, I deserrrve that. I just wanted to find you so I can apologiiize. I shouldn't have put everything out so bluntly.""Oh you think?!", Caleb snaps at her making her flinch."I-I'm sorry! Pleeease forgive me. I was onnnnly trying to help. You...you weren't being honest with yourself or with them so-""LOOK that's none of your business. We COULD'VE handled that on our own! Do you have any idea HOW much you've set us back?! There was finally peace the girls and I!", Caleb stated.Filo recovers from her initial fear and stands her ground, sort of speak, "You're lying. I can sense it. Deep down you know it's a lie."Caleb pauses wanting to retort again but found he had nothing to say."Whyyyy do you want to hurt yourself?", Filo inquires with a frown.Caleb's anger once again subsides. Now replaced with desolate frown. He sighs lowly casting his gaze off to the side, "I guess it's something I've always been good at."He hears a tiny whimper. He looks up to see Filo fluttering in front of him. The light around her body dimming as a very sad look on her tiny face met Caleb's. He sighs backing off, "Sigh, hey look don't...don't cry, ok? Sorry I hollered at ya just now...I just-all of this is crazy, you know? This multi-spousal marriage, Camilla, Lyca, and Moon pie, the Malones, yesterday, it's all just overwhelming! But...I know that the girls are hurting too.""You love all of them.", Filo says before fluttering over resting on his shoulder.Caleb looked down at her then forward towards the pond in thought, "Well, yeah, I think their all wonderful. Each of them is so unique and sweet in their own way. They make every day fun and interesting. They're...like family to me.", Caleb pauses as Filo stared at him intently listening, "I love them all...but...how I love them is different. Moon pie is my friend and my lover, I chose her and let the others know I still love them but as friends so they wouldn't be hurt. I thought it was enough...for all of us.""It doesn't have to be thaaaaat way.", Filo says, "You can be lovers with all of themmm and not have to worry about anyone being hurt.""Ugh, listen it's not THAT simple ok!", Caleb stated turning away from her."Why not?! The doggy and demon are in love with you and youuu love them the same way but, for whateeeever reason, you choose to push those feelings down.", Filo stands and pushes against his cheek, "You don't have to choose anyone, you can ALL be happy.""Will you stop?! It's not that simple, I said! There's no way it can work with us.", Caleb says."Oh? And why is that?", came another voice from above themCaleb and Filo turned their attention upwards to see Drei hanging upside down Spiderman-style attached to a rope. She releases herself and acrobatically land's on the other side of the bench striking a gymnist pose."Heh, he sent you huh? Honestly, I'm glad he did.", Caleb says with a small chuckle."I kinda cheated by VOLUNTEERING to come but whatever makes you feel less alone in the universe.", she says taking a seat next to him, "Now...why don't you believe it'll work?"Caleb went silent for a moment as he thought on it, "Well, let's start with obvious. Moon pie is FIRST girlfriend ever! I'm still learning what being in relationship is like and so is she. So I'm definitely not ready for marriage! I want to know her and really get more serious with her in the future. Trying to do the same thing with Camilla and Lyca just going to complicate things and may even cause bad blood between them!", Caleb paused before continuing to vent, "God, plus, even IF, and that's a big 'IF', I wanted to go through with this, I'm afraid Moon pie will start believing I love her less and less and I can't do that to her. Not after showing her how much she means to me. And say if one of them feels neglected and becomes resentful towards the others? What if I can't do anything to fix it? What if they each start becoming jealous of each other if I show even a little extra attention? I don't want them fighting over someone like me! And what if-Ow!", Caleb suddenly felt a small but firm hand smack his cheek then turns to Drei who looked at him plainly."What was that for?!", he asked."You were devolving into a bitch again, so I slapped it out of you.", Drei says with a monotone voice as Filo gave her a curious stare. Drei sits on her knees facing Caleb a hint of serious in her eyes, "Now you listen here, you made a lot of fair points up until you started spouting a bunch of 'what-if' scenarios that probably WON'T ever happen.""Well...I guess, technically, but still.", Caleb says earning yet another plain, unconvinced look from her. He recoils back."Yes, there's still a chance none of that will ever happen. And I think one of you're problems is you're unconsciously obeying your species mating rituals a bit too strongly. Dating, bonding on every level is well and good, but you shouldn't overanalyze and read too deeply into things. Liminals are not lIke humans females. They tend to fall hard and fall fast because life is short and there's no time to play guessing games with the heart; somewhere I think humans fall flat. If a liminal says they love you with all their heart, you better believe them with all your heart. Your guests, all of them are in love with you; just accept it and let yourself love them back. And I don't mean just the Nightmare.", Drei finished."You make it sound sooo easy", Caleb says wearily"That's because it is!", Filo stated standing to her feet."It really is.", Drei added before Caleb, in a fit of frustration, immediately rose to his feet causing Filo to fall off but catch herself mid-fall."Just stop, alright?! Even IF it seems "normal" for you guys...having multiple partners at once? It just feels...wrong. Moon pie...I just wanted love to HER. I never intended to feel the same for Camilla or Lyca. Worst part is, I know I lied to Moon pie when I said I didn't feel something for either of them!", Caleb ranted sadly before going silent and lethargically sitting back down leaning forward, "I lied to her and...I did it looking her right in her eyes. Those beautiful eyes. I couldn't even face her after the truth came out. Look at me. I'm sitting here too afraid to go home, pathetic. She deserves better."Filo fluttered beside him with a frown on her face able to sense the sorrow and shame within him. Drei closed her eyes and thought for a moment."Mr. Bizzell, are you a very religious person?" Drei inquired.Caleb gave her a ponderous look, "I don't...what's that have to do with anything?""Hm, judging from that response, I can assume your not. Are you Agnostic?", Drei asks."I-It's complicated. I used to follow Christianity when I was younger but kinda branched away as I got older. I don't consider any religion all that important. I haven't had much belief in anything since...", Caleb stops midsentence feeling a lump grow in his throat. Filo tenses feeling an profound amount of guilt coming from him as Drei watches him already understanding what he meant. Caleb notices them staring at him and clears his throat, "Ahem, anyways I don't think matters all that much. Why do you ask?""It was my guess your strong reservations towards multiple partners may have stemmed from religious beliefs and taboos. But now, I think I know the real reason.", Drei says earning a curious look from Caleb and Filo."You're afraid of change. More specifically, you're afraid the changes happening that are out of your hands.", Drei says."What the heck do you mean?!", Caleb incredulously stated, "I've been nothing but accepting of the changes in my life recently!""Yes, because you assumed you could get control over them. When Mirabelle confessed to you, you made her your girlfriend. When you were uncertain of Lyca and Camilla feelings toward you, you friendzoned them by announcing you ONLY love Mirabelle. When you realized you may have feeling for them, you pretend they don't exist to preserve the "peace" you established. What I'm trying to say is, you're a control freak. Case and point, you couldn't get control of the situation back there, so you left. And I'm not gonna lie that was a lame dick move on your part."Caleb eyes widened before he looks down in defeat knowing every word she said was true."So...what do you suggest I do?", Caleb asks weakly before Drei flicked her finger to his temple, "Ow! What the fuck is your problem?!", he retorts at her."That is what I suggest. Stop acting like a bitch and be the badass you're meant to be.", Drei stated resolutely."I'm no badass. I'm just an asshole.", Caleb replied." An 'asshole' wouldn't do HALF the things you do for those girls. You listen to them, you respect them, you treat each of them like you've known them all your life, you even risked your life by gang members and gang death by snusnu and COMFORTED each of them afterwards.", Drei stated as Caleb blushed."Can you...please not say that out loud?", Caleb replies urging her to lower her voice. He then heard Filo cheekily giggle furthering his embarassment."Believe me, I've seen hosts way shittier than you.", she continued, "The fact you've lasted this long and seem to still have fight left in you, that's pretty badass.""She's right! Youuu are a kind person. I've watched you for days and I see how patient and loving you are to each of them. That's nooothing to be ashamed of espescially when they feel the same way back.", Filo says fluttering next to his face."I...", Caleb trails off unable to find the right words to say."Tell me, what do you love about each of your guests? And yes, things you find physically attractive about them too.", Drei say raising an eyebrow. Caleb was taken aback by the sudden request."Yeah! Beeee honest too! ~I'll tell if you're lyinnng~", Filo added slyly wagging her tiny finger at him." I...WHY?!", Caleb inquired incredulously."Why not? Besides, there's a purpose to it. Now start before I knock you unconscious and leave you here naked.", Drei spoke plain but coldly." Can I draw on his face? ", Filo happily asked" Got a sharpie right here", Drei stated pulling a black marker from her clothes.Caleb looked between them realizing he was trapped. Realising he didn't have much choice, he figure he'll start easy."Well...Moon pie is just the gentlest girl I ever met. We have fun talking about anime, movies, and books. She's adorable, smart, and quiet but don't be fool, she can be a cheeky little pony. I love everything about her from her lovely, British-fueled voice to how she always smells like lavender flowers.", Caleb blushes suddenly, "I...also love...how she kisses me. Her lips are soft and sweet and I can tell she's putting her heart into each one. I uhh...also love how her fur feels. Seriously it's like velvet coated with pure ecstacy...and...and Iloveherbreasts there I said it."Drei looked to Filo and they both nodded in satisfaction. Drei then turns to him, "Alright, now what about Camilla and Lyca?"Caleb tenses up dreading this was coming next. He looks between to see their expectant gazes and sighs deciding to get it over with."Well...Lyca...is quite the energetic one. I get my fair share of exercise whenever I take her to this park.", Caleb started noticing Drei's displeased expression then continuing, "Ok, ok, Lyca is...she is just wonderful hehe! She's so much fun, outgoing, proud, not afraid to speak her mind, and just a girl I'd love to pal around with! Not to mention, she is a true ride-or-die girl. I believe everytime I'm ever in a fight she'll be the first one to back me up. She protected me from that hellhound even it meant getting herself killed. I've met anyone as unselfish her. ", Caleb speaks sweetly, "I love how honest, headstrong, and whimsical she is. At times, she CAN be a little too rambunctious to the point of annoyance but I don't hold it against. Wolves are born to be wild.""What about her looks? Isn't she preeetty?", Filo inquiredCaleb blushes and rubs the back of his head in embarassment, "Well...yeah she is...quite attractive.""Yes, continue, what about her is attractive?", Drei pressed."Well, I thought she was pretty the day I met her; but lately, I don't know why she decided to take her workouts so much more serious but damn is it paying off. She is the definition of toned and sexy. Have you seen those abs? Not to mention them thighs. Good lord them thighs; which compliment that tight round butt perfectly. And I just love when she hugs me I can just pet those cute little doggy ears. Don't get me started on those big, bright Amber eyes. When she looks at me with unconditional love and trust, my heart just melts!", Caleb crooned before noticing both girls smirking at him. He straightens up and clears his throat with a deep blush, "Ahem, anyways I think is a very attractive young woman.""Very good, now, Ms. Sartana.", Drei requested.Caleb hesitated for a minute giving himself time to mentally prepare, "Ok, um, she hasn't really been with me very long so I still have a lot I want to know about her only that she's had a very hard life. Despite that, I know she's a very kind and smart person. She looks intimidating but she's warm and loving. She a big help me around the house, an amazing cook, a talented artist, and she really caring towards Moon pie and Lyca. She's almost like a big sister to them. I've grown to love so much about her in a short time. From her adorable laugh to her charm to her passion even her terrifying demonic nature. Not sure if the last part is a bit masochistic but whatever.", Caleb giggles fondly before composing for what he was going to say next, " I...also think...she's one of the most gorgeous women I've ever seen. That beautiful brown hair, awesome black wing, smooth cute horns, and that sexy latina voice. And...", Caleb trails blushing heavily in embarrassment."Mmhm keep going. There's no judgement unless you choose to be dishonest.", Drei spoke semi-encouragingly. Caleb wanted to comment but chose the hard way out." And...she is...ridiculously curvaceous; calling her thicc would do her no true justice. I'm talking legs, 10 out of 10, thighs, 10 out of 10, butt, 10 out of 10, face, 10 out of 10, breasts, 100 out of 10! And her eyes have this...dark, ethereal beauty that pulls me in. Most people would find them scary or intimidating, but I feel they don't can't see the beautiful soul behind them. It's like my own soul is...drawn to her or something.", Caleb thought about the last part he said for a moment.Drei looked to Filo who enthusiastically nodded then back to Caleb, "OK, I believe that'll do.""Hahhh, finally, I thought I was going to die of embarrassment. I feel like a dirty pervert now.", Caleb sighed leaning hid back against the bench."So are most Americans on Tumblr but I give you a one time pass.", Drei commented."What was point of this", Caleb asks tirmoment, ,"The purpose was for you to clear the first of few hurdles: acceptance. Do you feel more comfortable with your feelings towards them now.", Drei inquiredCaleb thought for a moment, " I...I kinda do actually.""Good. Then you've just proven you are capable of loving and being attracted to each of them and STILL treat each of them fairly. That's really all it takes to be in a relationship with multiple partners.", Drei stated.Caleb's eyes widened in surprise, " What? Look t-there's no way-'""Not done!", Drei quickly cut him off, "Listen, I speak from experience, living in a family with three mothers and one father, it's actually no different from any other family. We had good days, we had fights, we have hard days...but we had each other. Papa was always caring towards my sisters and I and just as much so with our mothers. He was just a man who fell in love with women who loved him back twice as hard. Just like you(sorta)."Caleb went silent in thought. Filo suddenly appears in his face and says, "I think she's trying to say, being in a haaaarem isn't so bad and can even be fuuuun.""You don't have to force it. Keep treating them kindly, get closer to them, go on dates show them a good time, and most importantly, just love them. The rest will fall into place.", Drei says with a look of assurance"...I...I'll try. That all the good I can do." Caleb uttered to Filo's surprise and Drei's satisfaction."And that's just goof enough.", Drei nodded as Caleb smiled."Yaaaaaaay! You'll do great. You guys are all gonna be so happy together!", Filo cheered hugging and nuzzling Caleb's cheek."H-hey, come now now.", Caleb said with a light giggle"Of course, you know what the next hurdle is.", Drei stated. Caleb pauses as Filo sits down on his shoulder.Caleb sighs languidly before standing up, "Yeah, gotta go back home and do some damage control. Who knows what the girls are doing right now. Care to escort me back?""I hate escort missions. This is more like returning a lost child home.", Drei replies."Uhh, I'm pretty sure I'm like 2 years older than you.", Caleb facetiously comments."Not emotionally it seems. " Drei replies as she and Caleb proceed from the bench passing the pond.Caleb grumbled and replies, "Well at least I got you beat physically, shortstack.""Hmm, you're right. You do have me beat by a good 120 pounds, acne scars, and an weird looking penis", Drei replies as Caleb gets taken aback at her statement."Wha! What?! How the-", Caleb uttered embarrassed and confused before she continued."I tended to your wounds a few days ago remember? You think your pajamaa magically appeared on you when you woke up. But don't feel to bad, all dicks look weird.", Drei stated plainlyCaleb mouth was agape in shock. He wondered why that had not occurred to him up until this point. He then groans in embarassment facepalming, "Can the universe let me keep one iota of dignity? Just ONE?""The world's been fresh out of dignity since the fall of the Romans.", Drei commented.Caleb rolls his eyes, "True, but please don't tell Mirabelle and the others.""There's isn't really a lot to say. Though what can be said is all good. Yep, all good.", Drei says knowingly raising in eyebrow. Caleb then notices Filo sitting on his shoulder chuckling at their banter the whole time.Caleb sighs knowing he's fighting a losing battle, "Can we...just go home now?"She nods and they make their way out of the park following along the pathway until they come upon a lining of bushes and trees. Squirrels could be seen darting along the road and between the trees They walk side-by-side as a gentle breeze brought the rustling of leaves and pleasant late Summer ambience. Caleb glanced at his shoulder as Filo rocked her legs humming a song near his ear. The atmosphere felt quite nostalgic to Caleb.Suddenly a thought occurs to him and he turns to Drei, "Hey Drei, can I ask you something?""As long a it's not about politics, the weather, or what defines 'legal Loli", Drei comments, "because the answers no.""Wait, no to which one?", Caleb asks"Yes.", Drei says.Caleb shook his head, "Anyway, what was your dad like? Are male Kamaitachi as...diverse as females?""...Well, it's funny you should mention that. Papa was actually a-", Drei stops in her tracks; her body tenses as her ears twitched and tail and fur stood erect. Caleb and Filo notice her odd behavior."Uhh, Drei? Everything al-""Get down!", Drei stated leaping at Caleb knocking him flat to the ground. A ball of rippling gold energy strikes her sending electric charges through her body before sending her flying several feet away from Caleb.Caleb coughs and groans from pain, "Augh, Drei the hell was that f-", Caleb eyes widen in horror to see her on her side cringing in pain as her body emitted yellow electric sparks."D-Drei! Are you ok?! What happ-", Caleb stated running over to Drei before she yelled."NO! Stay...back! Argh haaagh just...run!", She uttered as she shakily tried standing to her feet only the fall to her knees, "arghhh we're under attack! Go!""I can't just leave you! Come on, we'll get away toge-!", Caleb stated kneeling beside her reaching to help her up."~Welllll aren't we the chivalrous type?~", came a familiar voice making Caleb tense up before he sees Drei's wide-eyed shocked expression at something behind him, "But that's exactly why chivalry...is dead.""Caleb, ru-", Drei stated urging her body to move to no avail. Only to be cut short when the figure delivers a sharp blow to the back of Caleb's neck."GAGGH!", he utters before he falls to the side unconcious to Drei's horror.Drei turns to the winged figure standing over her with a malicious grin. It was Azaeli. The Angel that stirred up trouble yesterday."Well, well, welly well well, if it isn't Ms. Coordinator. Or maybe you're something else to him. Either way, I have to cut your little park stroll short.", Azaeli chortled before taking out the photo of Caleb still glowing with the weird symbol. She then notices Drei position her body over Caleb's defensively bearing her small scythe at Azaeli."Hey, I'm trying to work, can you move?", Azaeli says displeased before swiftly kicking Drei away sending her rolling to the ground coughing in pain. Azaeli then places the photo on Caleb's head. To Drei's astonishment, the photo expands like a large tarp engulfing Caleb's body before gradually shrinking until the photo was back to it's original form but with Caleb's face completely blackened out. Azaeli bends over and retrieves it giving a sneering at Drei, "Well, that was easy. Ok midget, I've gotta run. My employers want me to kill this sumbitch but...I think I'll have some fun with as payback for yesterday."Azaeli then notices Drei shakily standing to her feet bearing her blades at her with a cold expression. It seems the spell is losing it's paralysis effects. Drei gets into an attack position preparing to strike."Tch, oh don't think I forgot about you bitch. You made me look real bad in front of those bible thumping pigs. I think you deserve retribution.", Azaeli glared at Drei forming a small magic seal, "I'm surprised you can still stand after that spell. Guess I better-"Azaeli was interrupted when Drei launched a small blade of air which Azaeli easily dodged. Azaeli glared angrily before noticing Drei was now mere inches from her arm reaching for the photo. Azaeli spin smacking Drei away with her wing knocking her against a tree. She then fires a bolt of electricity pinning Drei against the tree as she lets out an anguished wail. She falls to the base of the tree cringing in pain. Azaeli sways over until she stood over Drei with a boisterous smile."Hehehe you might be quick but your a weak little shit.",Drei clutched a fistfull of grass before saying in a strained low voice, "May...be...but...you're even weaker."Azaeli frowns in annoyance gritting her teeth before delivering a hard kick to Drei's stomach. Drei gag coughing before Azaeli delivers a few more strong kicks into her abdomen. When she was done, Drei was rasping for air and coughing; staining the grass red with blood."You better be glad I'm in a hurry or I would kick you to death right here.", Azaeli says before spitting at Drei and walking away. She spreads her wings taking off making sure to tuck the photo in her bra.Drei weakly reaches into a her sleeve. Out fall a three vials with mysterious orange liquid and her phone.WRSup Fam! Did you miss me? Admit it, you missed me. Well this chapter took awhile to get out of the way. School is rough, work is rough, you know how it is.

    Chapter 23: The Proposal( part 3)***1 hour earlier ***While Drei and Caleb were busy dealing the latter's issues, back at the house, Camilla and the rest were busy planning their approach to Mirabelle."Ok, that is about it.", Camilla finished her explanation noticing Lyca nodding fervently in understanding then noticing Ein and Zwei staring at her with different degrees of uncertainty."Are...you sure that'll work?", Ein says with scrutiny in her voice."Yeah, I'm pretty sure that might just weird her out.", Zwei added.Camilla puts her hands on her hips, "I don't think so. From what Señor tells me, she really enjoys that stuff. It cannot hurt to try.""She really likes it too! Chief got it for her.", Lyca stated assuredly, "Plus, her door's locked so we can't just walk in."I can just pick it. I'm a pretty good impromptu locksmith.", Zwei stated proudly puffing her chest."No! That will only make things worse to just barge in on her.", Camilla chided.Zwei turns to Ein who shrugs in uncertain, reluctant acceptance."Alright, I'll see what I can do.", Zwei says before turning and leaving out of the sliding doors to backyard. Camilla nods before going into the bedroom hallway with Lyca behind her....In Mirabelle's room...The nightmare paced around her room; her mind swarming with thoughts as she struggled to grasp everything she just learned.'This can't be happening. Why is this happening?! I can't believe Sterling would do this to us. I can't believe Lyca and Camilla! And Dear...', Mirabelle suddenly stops her body trembling as tears started rolling down her cheeks. She collapses on all fours to the floor sobbing into her palms. Her breathing is ragged as her heart feels like in was being crushed. She dries her tears to get the singing sensation out when her vision lands on the Sailor Moon stuffed doll. She seizes it and hugd it close to her body in order to give any semblance of security.'Why? Why Dear? You said you only loved me. You said you weren't attracted to them! You said I was all you needed! Why were you lying to me?! ', Mirabelle screamed in her head tightening her grip on the plush toy like it was her last connection to sanity. She trembled and lightly rocked herself rocked and whimpering. During this, she failed to notice the hand placed on the outside of her bedroom window sneakily raise it open slightly. Zwei poked her ears up taking a peak inside and seeing the purple centaur sobbing. She felt bad for her but remembered what she had to do. She drew her scythe, taking aim at the doll Mirabelle held and, with a quick motion of her wrist, sent a tiny blade of compressed air. It cuts off a piece of the dolls red cloth ribbon, without Mirabelle noticing, and it fell to the floor. Zwei makes a circle with her index and middle finger targeting the fallen piece. She parses her lips and blows sending a faint breeze that rolls the fallen piece under the bedroom.'Lamest. Mission. Ever.', Zwei thought.Mirabelle sniffles having noticed the sudden draft. She looks toward the window wonder if she forget to close it last night. Only the find it closed....Outside her door...Camilla picks up the red piece of cloth. She then creates a small blue magic seal in surrounding her open palm with the piece in it as Lyca and Ein watched curiously. Camilla began chanting something under her breath. They notice it didn't sound like Spanish; it was something more ancient and slightly distorted.Zwei immediately joins them, " So, how are things on this end?""It looks like she just started. Good job getting the piece.", Ein praised."Yep, I woke up, had breakfast, then assassinated a toy doll. Now that's a productive morning.", Zwei say rolling her eyes."Silencio! I am about to begin.", Camilla says to them while focusing....back in the room...Mirabelle's thoughts continue to bombard her as she struggles with what to do next. She holds her forehead feeling a headache starting to form.She then releases the Sailor Moon doll from her chest and looks down at it thoughtfully."Hahhh, I'm so confused. And hurt. And angry, and sad and...I don't know what to think anymore. I wonder how a sailor scout would handle this.", Mirabelle spoke sadly to the doll when something she wasn't expecting happened. It answered her."I do not know about them but I know ju don't have to answer that alone.", the doll said to Mirabelle shock as it jerked it's head up to look at her."HYAAAHHH!", Mirabelle shrieked before tossing it away from her and standing up quickly backing further away, "W-W-WHAT?! The bloody hell?!"Her eyes locked on where she tossed the doll she tenses and trembles as it starts picking itself up moving on it's own before facing her. A small blue magic seal can be faintly seen in the partially lit room. It starts moving toward her. Mirabelle backs up to the window in fear and wondering if she was going crazy."Oh gods have I gone crazy?!", she spouted in horror. The sentient walks up to her muppet-style getting closer into view from the natural light from the window."Ju are not loco Señorita. This is really happening.", the doll spoke. Mirabelle instantly recognized Camilla's voice and her body relaxed a bit before looking down at the doll questioningly."M-Ms. Camilla, is that you? H-How did you get inside my sailor moon plushie?", Mirabelle inquired gingerly picking up the toy in her hands."I am not inside. I am merely controlling it with a manipulation spell. It is something one of mi miembris (clan members) taught me. Granted, it was made to prank others but I believe it is useful here."Mirabelle's surprised expression changes to an unamused frown, "Pleasant to know my wish to be alone is a joke to you. Why do I even bother?""No! No, Señora, I did this because we need to talk. But I knew ju wouldn't want to even look at me right now so I thought ju may have an easier time speaking with...errr...", she trails off'Go on say the thing.', Mirabelle was surprised by the whispered voice of Lyca come from the doll."Errrr...the pretty gaurdian of Amo-i mean 'love' and justice in a sailor suit. I am Sailor Moon?", Camilla awkwardly stated the words Lyca told her as the doll spun around doing the pose Lyca showed her. Mirabelle's eyes lit up as heart palpitated at the sight. While outwardly still upset knowing it is STILL Camilla's voice and the line was slightly butchered, her inner fan girl was squealing in joy to see her childhood anime hero in her room. Or at least the closest thing to it.'Pffffft, hahahahah-ow!', Mirabelle heard Zwei chuckle through the doll before hearing chuckling come from the other side of the door followed her pained yelp and Ein quickly telling her to 'shut up'. This brought her back to her as she remembered the reason behind all of this. As much as she wanted to be alone a small part of of her was thankful for the intrusion as it meant she didn't have to be left alone with her thoughts."I only need 5 minutas Senora. That is all I ask, then I will leave."Mirabelle thought for a moment before giving her answer, "I...I guess we could talk for a bit. You did go through this much trouble.", Mirabelle says somewhat reluctantly before sitting down on the floor."Gracias Señorita.", the dolls before toddling over to the awaiting centaur. Mirabelle could help but blush and grin her imagination pictured a chibi Sailor Moon walking over to have a talk with her."Hm? Señorita are ju ok? ", the doll questioned tilting it's head slightly in reference to Mirabelle strange expression. Mirabelle fought the urge to pick up the toy and cuddle the crap out of it."Y-yes! Ahem I'm fine.", Mirabelle's voice cracks a little but composes herself enough to take this situation seriously...enough. The doll sits on the floor in front of her before she began."Senora, I know this must be hard for ju, I cannot imagine how much ju hurt right now, but please understand that ju are not alone.", Camilla says to her as Mirabelle looks away her sadness returning."If that's true, then why?", Mirabelle inquired in a serious tone, "I thought things were finally going back to how they were before! We were all happy up until this morning.""I'm sorry Señora. I...we didn't intend for this to happen but ju must understand. Everyone was not as happy as they appeared. There were some issues that needed to be addressed and it was only a matter of time until they came out.", the doll spoke in Camilla's voice."Issues like your feelings for my Dear?", Mirabelle asked coldly.Outside the door, Lyca gave a worried whimper as Camilla continued to hold her meditative stance with the small blue seal spinning in front of her. Ein and Zwei listened intently before Camilla reluctantly answered."Jes Señora. Señorita Lyca and I were just discussing it and we cannot deny that we love Señor Caleb as well. We are in love with Señor."Mirabelle grips the hem of her black skirt in frustration fighting back the tears, "Then tell me! When Caleb and I made it clear we were lovers, and you each supported, was all of that a lie? Did you feel there was no chance with him so you decided to hide your true feelings?! Admit it...you hated that he only wanted to be with me!"The doll went silent as Mirabelle anxiously awaited an answer. Finally, she got one."...Ju are not wrong, Señora.", Camilla spoke surprising, not only Mirabelle, but Lyca and the Zyklons as well, "When Señor drew that line in the sand, I was devastated. I'm sure Señorita Lyca was too. I lived half mi life fighting, suffering, bleeding, seeing others bleed, living in a world that despise mi own existence. Then, by the blessings of Discord, I meet my Destino and he accepts me into his home only to find his heart already belongs to another and he refuses to let anyone else inside. It hurt Señora. It hurt to be so far out of reach from everything you've longed for but could not have. I am sorry my found out this way. But we did it because we did not want to lose Señor."Mirabelle listens but looks away in thought. She could understand where she was coming from but it still didn't change her stance."I was a bit jealous of ju Señora but it does not mean I hated you or your relationship with Señor. We have and still respect your dynamic. And now...things have changed. We no longer have to hide our feelings.", Camilla continued."S-so I guess that makes it ok? Lying about how you really felt just to spare my feelings? Am I THAT pathetic?! Am I a child to you?! E-even...m-my Dear lied to me. He said it to my face he didn't have feeling for either of you. But he was lying.", Mirabelle lamented as her voice cracked in pain, "Why...why would...h-he said...he said I was only one he wanted to be with. Why? ...I'm no better though. I lied to myself thinking everything was going to be ok.Camilla goes silent momentarily in thought before replying, "Señora, none of us think of ju that way. The only reason Lyca and myself decided to suppress how we felt was...because...we...WE were afraid. We were afraid that...if we acted on our hearts, we'd end up getting them broken. Perhaps breaking yours and Señor's as well. I still do not fully understand Señor Caleb but...I believe deep he knew this as well. Ju saw his reaction. His fear, anger, and confusion. Who knows how long he has been agonizing over his true feelings? He must have wanted to tell you the truth but he was too afraid...just like us."Mirabelle was about to reply but then she remembered their experience in the dreamscape last night. She thought of how he immediately told her about his moment he shared with Camilla on the roof and realized if he truly wanted to hurt he WOULDN'T have told her at all. Then she remembered something else. She could sense last night in the dreamscape that, even after telling her what happened, he still felt...ashamed for some reason. It was faint but she could tell there was something else he wanted to tell her...but couldn't. She decided ignore for now and have their fun and help him relax. Was THIS what he wanted to tell her?"Listen Señora", Camilla continued as the doll toddled over to her resting it's nubs for hands of her lap and looking up at her, " ju have the right to feel angry and betrayed. Especially, with HOW ju found out( fucking government idiota), she said the last part under her breath. It would have been better to talk with ju sooner."Mirabelle looks away from the doll in thought before replying, "Yes...it would have. All of this is so confusing to me. I don't know how to process all of this.""It's ok Señora. Ju are not a not alone, we will deal with it together.", Camilla says through the doll. Mirabelle was surprised by how similar her words sounded like what Caleb would say to he. She pondered for a moment then looked down at the doll. She reaches down and picks up the sentient toy surprising the puppeteer on the outside of her door."You know...as much as I enjoy, and I mean REALLY enjoy conversing with the closest I'll ever get to SAILOR BLOODY MOON in real life!", Mirabelle exclaims happily making her way to the door before continuing, "I...I would rather we talk...and see each other. So...please enter.", she utters before she unlocks the door. She steps back still holding the doll as the door opened showing Camilla with a proud grin and Lyca beaming sweetly while Ein and Zwei wore intrigued looks.Mirabelle works up to nerve to look Camilla and Lyca in the eyes, "I-I want to talk to you, both of you, woman to woman to...um woman.""That will be fine Señora.", Camilla says as she walks in."Thanks for letting us in Mira. It's been a little while since I've been in your den!", Lyca beams at her before stepping inside and immediately flopping on the edge of the bed. Mirabelle was about to advise her not to mess up the bedspread she previously made up then notice the Zyklons just standing in the hall unsure of what to do now."U-um...did you...want to join us?", Mirabelle inquired."Well, I thought it would be good to let you guys sort things out for yourselves-" , Ein says before Zwei immediately jumps in"Buuuuut! We can probably weigh in on this subject a lot better. Maybe provide some usable input. So yes we're joining .", Zwei then proceeds inside to join the rest as Ein tries in vain to reach out and stop her before slumps her arms in defeat. Zwei belly flops of the bed knocking the sheet and comforter ever more out of place as Mirabelle gave a look about to scold her before sighing deciding it just wasn't worth it."Haaah, very well then. It would be more effective for all of us to solve this issue as together.", Ein agrees with a stiff expression before frowning a bit noticing the room was already getting crowded, "I...I just...stand here with the door open. Maybe someone will come the front door. Somebody will have to answer.""Way to be the world's thickest and deadliest doorstop sis.", Zwei chuckled with smug grin."Shut up.", Ein retorted.Camilla clears her throat getting their attention, "Señorita? Are ju ready?"Mirabelle turn to the Elder Devil still hugging the sailor moon doll. She could tell by the look in her eyes she was ready for whatever happens next. She responded to her, "Y-Yes. Let's have a do over. I want...you both to tell me again. This time...be completely honest. Are you TRULY fine with Dear and I being lovers?"Camilla and Lyca expressions turned serious with the latter being the first to speak.Lyca rose up from bed sitting on the edge, "We are, Mira! We support you 1000%. ...But...I love Chief too!""En efecto ( Indeed) Señora, I too am proud ju both taken this step! However, I cannot deny I have strong feelings for him as well. I hope ju can forgive me.", Camilla stated placing left hand over het heart then slowly clenching into a fist."Me too! I...I'm sorry!", Lyca added her ears dropping to the sides of her head. Mirabelle watched them with bewilderment at how sincere they look. It caught her off gaurd; so much she was unsure what to say next. An awkward silence was beginning to form in the room."Well, you each love this guy!", Zwei stated breaking the silence as they each turned to her, "Now that we've established that for the 50th time, let's expand on it! Really dig in there!", she emphasizes making shoveling motion with her hands."Wh-What do you mean?", Mirabelle nervously inquired."I mean, WHY do you love this guy? Obviously. There's TONS of nice guys in the world, what makes him so special?", Zwei replies in a slightly irreverent tone, "I believe you guys need...professional help."Ein's face droops in horror, "Oh gods Zwei, No!""Oh gods Zwei, yes! This is a job for...", Zwei swiftly reposition sitting up crossing her legs, then flipping her hair to the side getting into a business woman pose, "Mediator Zwei."Mirabelle and the others blink in confusion as Ein lets out an sigh full of dread."Ughhh, Zwei come on. This is serious, show a little more tact.", Ein stated at her sisters lack of courtesy."N-no! I think I understand what she is doing.", Camilla stated to Zwei's satisfaction, "In order to understand each other, we must understand why we each love him...I think.""Please, don't encourage her.", Ein pleaded."See? She gets it. I'm sure you guys have lots of things you like about him. Hell, Lyca here has a laundry list of reasons she likes him.", Zwei stated playfully nudging the she-wolf who lightly blushes in embarassment, "It's alright, just tell them what you told me. Be 1000% honest."Lyca looks to Zwei's assuring grin then turns to everyone's expectant stares, "Well...Chief is so nice to me. He cares about how I'm feeling, he always makes sure I've had enough to eat, and he's so kind to me. Back...in my old pack...everyone was mean to me, always bossing me around and making me feel like I was less than dirt and for a long time...I believed them. Even after I worked up the nerve to finally leave. Then Mon found me and I thought things would get better since they fed me and even gave me clothes. But then I had to deal with DIFFERENT people telling me what to do and treating me like a baby.", Lyca trails off for a moment as her frown transitions to a smile, "Chief never did that. He treats me like an equal and doesn't make me feel stupid when I do something wrong. Even when he gets mad or annoyed at me, I can tell it's because he really cares about me. Ever since coming here, I hardly ever feel worthless, dumb, or I don't belong. I do belong. Right here with Chief. And I want to be with him forever!"Lyca finished holding her arms behind her back swaying to and fro with cheeks flushed pink and tail swaying. Mirabelle, Camilla, and Ein watched her with varying degrees of surprise and intrigue. Lyca looked to Zwei with a hint of uncertainty in her eyes to which the wind weasel gave her a thumbs up and a pleased nod of approval."Lyca...I...I never knew that's how you felt.", Mirabelle says with a slight hint of shame in her voice."I mean yeah. I love Chief, Mira. He's given me more than I ever thought I needed. It's why I wanted to get stronger so what happened that one night when I lost him won't EVER happen again. I nearly died and almost failed to protect him. I won't let that happen ever again to the one person gave me a new life.", Lyca proudly stated clutching her fist to her chest.Mirabelle softly smiles at her, "You sure are amazing Lyca. I owe you so much for what you did.""No you don't Mira. I'd do the same for you too. You're like a sister to me...or more like what I think a sister should be.", Lyca replies happily as Mirabelle gives a surprised look before softening to an understanding grin."Alright, you're turn...uhh...shit I had something for you and I forgot it. Something with Catherine Zeta Jones? Forget it, anyway your turn devil woman.", Zwei says as Camilla shoots an unamused glare her way. Everyone now focuses on Camilla.Camilla clears her mind to think then exhaled slowly, "All my time on this earth I have seen countless men. Human. Devil. And I've hated every single one to mi very core. I saw them as nothing more than greedy, selfish, sickening creatures who use women like toys. They hurt me. In many, many ways. I personally felt they all deserved nothing but slow, agonizing pain and death and I was happy to carry it out myself!", Camilla viciously hissed near the end as the girls wore disturbed looks on their faces. Camilla took a minute to compose herself from her slight bloodlust before taking a calmer tone, "But...Senor? When I first met him, at first I thought he was just some idiota human was unlucky enough to not mind his own business. However, the way he spoke to me was so sincere despite the circumstances, something awakened in me that night. Something I never thought could exist.""W-what's that?", Mirabelle inquired before gulping nervously."The ability to love a man.", Camilla replies, " When I'm around Señor, my heart races, mi wings quiver, and I can not think of anything else but wanting to be with him. I feel like a part of mi very essence I never knew was missing...is now right before. That's how I knew he was mi Destino.""You...knew he was your "Destined one" because you could "feel" it?", Ein inquired curiously, "How does that work?""I do not fully understand but we Devils know. However, it was more than just a feeling. I saw firsthand the kind of man Señor is. He is the kindest, most caring, selfless and patient men I've ever met. Despite knowing what mi tipo (my kind) are capable of, he's never treated me with suspicion, distrust, or fear. He's looked at me as an object for sex or a monster to be killed. He saved not only me, but mi Amigas as well.", Camilla spoke meaningfully thinking back to the motel and the Hellhounds, "At one point he would've given up his life in exchange for ours. That alone speaks volumes of someone's personaje(character). He even stood up for us when that Malone vilified our existence!"Mirabelle and Lyca listened very clearly engrossed in her explanation."Even yesterday against that foul Angel, he was resolved to stand up for me and all of us! I have never met anyone like him. I never knew any human could make me feel this way. That kind, accepting smile and passionate eyes combined with that brave, selfless attitude...it's enough to make a woman plum loco!", Camilla says cupping her blushing cheeks as she sways her body sensually in adoration. She stops when she realizes they're still staring at her and quickly straightens up and clears her throat, "A-anyway, what about ju Señorita Mirabelle? Why do ju love him?"Mirabelle blushes deeply, "W-Well I-""Hey! I'M the mediator here! I'll ask her!", Zwei chided irritated her thunder being stolen. Camilla glares in annoyance as Ein shakes her head in embarassment. Zwei turn to Mirabelle with an innocent smile and says, "Ok, Ms. Marequine it's your turn why do you love him so much."Mirabelle composes herself enough to answer, "Dear...when I first met him...he didn't seem any different from any other wanker I was unfortunate enough to live with and see the ugliness they kepts inside them towards me. I was afraid I made the same mistake again. But I was wrong, he was different. I looked inside him and found only the man he is. He's shown me nothing but compassion, kindness, and patience.", Mirabelle gradually loosens into a genuine smile, "He's goofy, smart, an amazing cook, and we always have a grand time talking about anime and manga and books. When I'm with him, it's like my fears of the world, my cowardice, everything I hate about myself don't matter. I love drowning myself in his warm, secure embraces while I place my ear to his pulsating core listening to rhythmic jubilant sound of life. It's like a soothing lullaby for my soul at peace. Every kind word he says is like honeydew to my ears. Every touch invigorates my senses and makes me feel I can do anything! Even IF he's not around, I feel like he is. I'm not as shy or scared as I used to be. I've learned more about his culture and society. Sometimes...I even feel brave.", Mirabelle pauses closing her eyes wistfully. Camilla and the others listened with different degrees of intrigue and compellation."He changed me.", Mirabelle spoke lovingly, "or, at the least, I feel like I am changing. I feel as though I've gone through most of my life, barely half alive. Meeting him was like finding the rest of my life. I feel...whole. That...may sound silly I know."Camilla steps up and gently takes Mirabelle's hand to the latter's surprise, "No Señora, I feel the same as ju. I have never felt this way before...about anyone but mi Madre.""Me too!", Lyca stated bouncing to Mirabelle's side laying a hand to her shoulder, "I feel different too ever since I started living with you and chief.""It is a scary...but also quite amazing feeling. Right?", Camilla saysMirabelle smiles warmly at her, "Y-yeah."Suddenly Zwei started clapping alerting everyone, "Woo! That's what I'm talking about! Now you're getting it!"Mirabelle the others gave her a puzzled look."What do you mean?", Mirabelle inquired"Isn't it obvious? You girls each love this guy, for largely the SAME reasons. He gave you each SOMETHING you were missing or needed in your life! You also gained something from each other that you needed.", Zwei replies proudly, "It's cheesy but it's true. Truth is cheddar baby!"Camilla, Mirabelle, and Lyca wore genuinely confused expressions.Ein audibly clears her throat, "I believe she's trying to say that each of you needed the other just as much as you all needed Mr. Bizzell. You're all unique in your own ways yet somehow your paths and desires align perfectly. If I'm being completely honest, you guys almost remind me of our mothers and father.""And...how it that?", Camilla inquired a bit skeptically."Hey yeah! They kinda do. Dad brought out the best in each of our mothers and they did the same with each other.", Zwei chuckled."Is that true?", Mirabelle inquire"Of course!", Zwei says before turning to Mirabelle with a serious look, "So, Ms. Marequine, after hearing all of this do you still think being in a multi-spousal relationship will be a bad thing?"Camilla and Lyca were taken aback at first but not as much a Mirabelle who paused in deep contemplation. She looked around as they waited in anticipation for her answer."I-It's ok, if you don't Mira. Really.", Lyca sadly stated, "I wouldn't blame you if you hate us for trying to force this on you."Mirabelle was shocked by the assumptions and immediately replied, "W-What are saying? I don't hate you! I don't hate any of you! Lyca. Ms. Camilla. I said earlier that I already assumed we were a family...because I meant every word. I love you both! This conversation now only made me truly realize...how close we truly are. I-I want this to work. However...I suppose I would be lying if I said I didn't have some doubts. How WOULD this even work?"Camilla and Lyca gave elated expressions at the notion that she was at least considering the idea now."Mira, listen, Cami and me were talking earlier were talking earlier and...we thinks it's only fair that YOU become Alpha Female!", Lyca stated earning a stunned look from Mirabelle."W-Wha?", she uttered"Jes Señora, Señorita Lyca explained how werewolf hierarchy works. It is actually quite similar with clans of mi gente (my people) where we have a Matrona (clan matron). The first wife of the clan Patron whom he favors among the harem and has the strongest magic. And ju have strong magic Senora.", Camilla explains as Mirabelle tried to really comprehend her words."Chief chose you Mira. You're his favorite but he still loves us too. It only makes sense and if we want to be with him we ask your permission first.", Lyca says with a content expression. Ein and Zwei wore uncertain expressions at that idea.Mirabelle thought for a moment, "Me? Strong? Really? And...are they both truly fine with that? Would Dear be fine with that?""Um, if I may, it doesn't necessarily have to be as...political as that.", Ein started as she walk up to them, "Have any of you thought maybe Mr. Bizzell could love you all equally?"Mirabelle turned to her quizzically as Lyca and Camilla eyes lit up."W-Wait...that's an option?", Lyca asked in astonishment."Yeah Lycs, it worked for our family. Dad was always loving towards us and each of our moms. Now, your host is nowhere near Pop's level, be he's got potential. It's obvious he loves each of ya deeply so why not drop the "Number 1 girl" crap and just work it out?"Mirabelle wore an uncertain expression which Ein senses and steps in front of her taking a knee to be at eye level, "Ms. Marequine, it may seem strange, but this can be a beautiful thing. I'm sure right now my sister is having a similar conversation with your host. He's a good man what we've observed so I'm sure he'll do anything to make all of you happy. "Mirabelle eyes widened as she looked to Camilla and Lyca. She couldn't deny she cared for them deeply at this point. Even Ein, Zwei, and Drei are becoming like family to her."I-I'll do it.", Mirabelle says earning a surprised look from Camilla and Lyca, "If my Dear's heart is truly big enough for us all, I wouldn't be good partner if I didn't support him.", Mirabelle smiles at Camilla and Lyca, "besides I'd rather share him with my friends rather than some strangers.""YAY!", Lyca beams letting out a happy bark before leaping on Mirabelle, who lets out a startled yelp, before nuzzling her face to the Centaur's, "I'M SO HAPPY MIRA!""Ah! Hahahahaha stop it Lyca! Y-your fur ti-hihihickles!", Mirabelle giggles at the overly affectionate she-wolf.Camilla crosses her arms with a proud smile, "Gracias Señorita, I promise ju will not regret this.", Mirabelle smiles back at her."Woo! Mediator Zwei does it again!", Zwei exclaims crossing her hands behind her head smugly.Ein and Camilla rolls their eyes shaking their heads. Mirabelle gently pushed Lyca off to catch her breath before facing Camilla."U-um, thank you, Ms. Camilla.""Hm? For what Señora?", she asks curiously."For being so understanding towards me...and really being honest with me."Camilla grins sweetly, "Of course, honestly, I am quite used to dealing with troubled chicas. Compared to the youth of mi gente, ju are quite tame.""Ehehe", Mirabelle blushes slightly, "I, um, I also...want to thank you for making a childhood dream come true.", she holds in a squeal displaying the Sailor Moon doll.Camilla chuckles, "Ju can thank Senorita Lyca for that. She told me how much like it sooooo...", she trails with a shrug."Hehe, but I didn't expect you to make it to life and stuff. You just asked if there was 'anything personal she treasured'.", Lyca replies."What if that thing I treasured was...I don't know...a locket? Would you make THAT talk to? That would be bloody bonkers!", Mirabelle chortled."Meh, I would have have worked around it. We Devils are known for our tricks.", Camilla stated proudly."I was little worried to what EXTENT you would take to cheer her up. Clearly I may have been right to be." Ein adds."but hey, it worked out anyway, so yeah. You think you do that again Cami?! I want you to try it on my toy Chief got me too. ", Lyca inquired."Uhhh, maybe later, that particular spell is quite taxing on the senses. The devil who taught me used it too often on pranking humans and nearly went blind and deaf.", Camilla explained."You used something like THAT for me?", Mirabelle stated in surprise."Being blind and deaf would be nothing compared to losing mi new amigas.", Camilla replies laying a comforting hands on Mirabelle and Lyca's shoulders."Yeah! I'd rather be blind and deaf too! Plus, I can always SMELL you guys!", Lyca grinned showing off her nose like a trophy."I believe Dear's weirdness is rubbing off on us.", Mirabelle shakes her head with a giggle happy at the thought of having friends like the two of them."Hmmm, ju know I wonder how Señor will react when he returns...and we tell him the great news.", Camilla said with a devilish chuckle."Hah, Drei must have her hands reallll full right now!", Zwei laughed."Chief IS a little scary when he's mad.", Lyca added to which Mirabelle nodded in agreement.Suddenly, Ein's phone starts ringing. She takes it from inside her robe and looks at the caller-ID, " huh, what timing, it's Drei", Ein says before answering, "Hello sister, is everything ok?...What? H-Hold on, Drei what's-""What I tell ya? She must be-", Zwei nudges to Lyca only for Ein to interrupt her."Would ju shush! Drei?! Drei, what's wrong?!", Ein says with an extremely worried expression. Zwei's smile fades as a bad feeling in her gut told her something wasn't right and quickly gets to get feet. Mirabelle, Lyca, and Camilla start to become worried as they listened to the conversation."Drei! I can't understand you please tell me what happened!", Ein inquired.****Park****Along a partially wooded area, Drei was standing with shaky legs using a nearby tree for support. Her body aching slightly from the strong magic attacks it endured. Her side is visibly bandaged with a large reddish blood stain and her breathing was a bit labored. It's a good thing she brought a few salves and a couple vials of potion to heal her shattered rib bones and dull the pain."Ergh, I said...the Angel, she ambushed me...ack...she took Mr. Bizzell. I'm at...the park ergh a few blocks from the house... too weak to make it back...I'm near the cedar trees at the Northern entryway. Call Sterling and get back up...ack now! Have Zwei...bring me the green apothecary bag under my bed to left. Not right, LEFT!"Hangs up****At the house****Ein goes silent clutching the phone and clenching get teeth as the girls look to get with anticipation and fear. Zwei is the first to approach."Well? Come on Ein, what's wrong with Drei?!""What happened to Senor?!", Camilla inquired"Zwei! Go to the house, get Drei's green bag under her bed to the left. She at the Northern entryway of the park a few blocks from here bring it to her! She's injured!", Ein gave her commands sternly, "I need to contact Sterling and MON support units immediately! Go now!"Zwei pauses before nodding in understanding with focused eyes, "Right!"Zwei zooms out of the room in a blur of brown and green leaving sharp gust of wind behind that blew through the room knocking down several objects."Hey! What's happening?! We have to know if Chief is ok!", Lyca stated in annoyance and worry."T-That's right! We deserve to know!", Mirabelle stated mimicking Lyca.Ein looks to them then sees Camilla glaring with a look that said 'Tell us, or I'll force it out of ju', she sighs, "Drei and Mr. Bizzell were attacked, Drei was seriously injured and Mr. Bizzell has been abducted."Camilla, Lyca, and Mirabelle faces went pale in horror. The latter two in particular felt a surge PTSD reliving the experience of losing the man they care about and not being with him when it happened."By who? Was it the Malones?!", Camilla angrily inquired.Ein sighs, "You're not going to like the answer."******Now******In downtown Huntsville, there was a multi-level parking garage across the street from a large Methodist church with several patrons going in for devotion and praise. Inside the garage at the highest level, there were very few cars save for one that had been sitting unattended for the last three months. The entire area was dimly lit save for the rays of sunlight permeating throughout opening.Caleb begins to groggily awake from a daze. He felt slightly numb all over and his head ached like crazy."Hey! Wake up already! *SMACK*""Argh! Errrghhh", Caleb groaned feeling the sudden intense pain on his. He tried to clutch his face to massage the pain but finds his movements restricted. It was then he realizes his hands were binded together with his feet barely touching the floor, "W-Wha-""Come on get up, your gonna miss the fun.", came a familiar voice laced with unnerving malice.Caleb squints as his blurry vision gradually clears. His eyes widen in shock to see the Angel from the restaurant yesterday right in front of him with an impatient yet amused look on her face as she stared down at him her wings folded in behind her back and dragging the floor like a black feathery cape."Y-You?! W-WHAT THE FU-", He thrashed about trying to get away from her until he looks up at his binded hands was surprised to see them binded, not only with chains, but these chains were glowing a bright goldish-yellow as if they were literally made of light, "The FUCK IS THIS?! Where am I?! Where's Drei?!""Well, we're in a parking lot, that much should be obvious. This spot is special since hardly anyone ever comes up here on Sunday. As for this "Drei", dumb name by the way, I'm guessing you mean Ms. Coordinator Bobo or whatever the fuck she wanted to call herself, I left her for dead in the bushes. Don't worry, I'm sure SOMEBODY will find her body. Or maybe she'll become mulch for the tree, whichever is good.", Azaeli says with an amused chuckle.Caleb jaw hung open in shock of hearing that before a surge of anger through him, "Y-You...WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER YOU FUCKING BITC-HAARHHGH!", he spat out before Azaeli drove her fist into his stomach making him cough in sheer pain; making it worse as he couldn't even lurch over."THAT'S ENOUGH OUT OF YOU! What I did to her is nothing compared to what I'm going to do to you.", Azaeli sneers in irritation and with a quick motion of hand the chains slack allowing him to drop to floor on his knees still coughing and wheezing. Azaeli kneels down and forcefully grabs Caleb by the neck forcing him to look up at her as he struggled for air. Her eyes were filled with maliciousness as she looked at him with great disdain, "So please, please make this last longer. You're already a pain in my ass so I won't mind taking my time killing you."He flings him backwards and he hits the back of his head against the concrete wall."Arrghhh, ", Caleb exclaims as the impact has him clutching his head in intense pain. He look back up at at but was greeted by the toe of Azaeli's boot jamming itself into his mouth accompanied by her jeering laughter as his body writhed as he choked on it the foreign object."Kyahahahaha! Yeah that right! Choke on my boot you worthless little insect. A bug like you deserves to live under my heel! Don't worry, the fun has only started. Consider it punishment for your insolence yesterday.", She chortles in glee.WROof, things are really heating up. Sup fam? Hope you guys are enjoying the Holiday season. I sure am. Well finals are over and I have been invested in Borderlands 3. It's such a great game( still miss Jack though, the Calypso Twins suck.) I have been writing like crazy so expect updates all around, for most of my stories. One more thing, guess who's turned 24 this month? Yeah, it's me. 24 on 24th, ain't that something?Welp, that's about it for now. Peace Fam.

Mirabelle and Lyca paced about the living room unable relax or contain themselve. They were reliving the worst experience from the month before. Camilla wore a sullen expression as she sat at the counter holding her forehead and tapping the countertop incessantly. Sterling was there as well. After Ein called and told him what happened, he immediately came to help them and contacted support from ICEP to begin an manhunt. Zwei found Drei in the park. After bringing her the requested items, she quickly whipped up a medicine to heal the rest of her wounds. The both of them returned to Caleb's house where Drei filled them in on more details on what happened. Drei was currently on the couch recovering more of her strength while Zwei and Ein watched over her both with worried expressions."This can't be happening. Why?! Why is this happening?", Mirabelle repeated with a horrified expression."I could've gone with him-I-could've'-taken-her Grrraahhhh I should've gone after him!", Lyca growled cursing herself."Ms. Kessler! Marequine! I need you both to calm down.", Sterling says to the two panicked girls."Are they dispatching any other MON agents to help with the search?", Ein inquired."Yes, but most of our units close by gave been designated to act as guards during the execution of Nikolai. The only other units available at this time won't arrive for another hour.", Sterling explained."An hour?! That's insane! And why is there so much security for ONE gang member?", Zwei stated in disbelief."That 'ONE gang member' as you put it Ms. Zyklon, is directly related to one of the most dangerous criminal families of the 21st century only made even more dangerous now that Liminals are working for them! He's highly respected in that family and it stands to reason they would do anything to stop that execution. On top of that, the integrity of our ICEP agents has been called into question lately ever since some were found to be WORKING with the Malones so we've been in a tough spot finding trustworthy agents!", Sterling stated."Have they at least been able to track him through the chip we placed in his phone?! I'm sure he had it on him when he left I can't get anything with my tracker.", Ein inquires showing the app on her phone commissioned to MON agents."I keep checking with them but they keep saying they can't pinpoint his location. There's some type of interference.", Sterling says before Lyca interjects."In THAT'S the case, just let me track him! Take me to spot that bird wing bitch took him and I'll find her!", Lyca stated assuredly."Ms. Kessler, we can't let you do that! We have our procedures to-", Sterling says only for Camilla to interrupt."Qué montón de mierda(what a load of shit), FUCK ju are your 'procedures'! We settle this de right way and that is finding Señor and make that Angel pay!", Camilla finished in a venomous tone before turning to Lyca, "Senora Lyca, are ju sure ju can find him?""Of course, I know Chief's scent by now like the back of my paws.", Lyca stated confidently, "The trail should be still fresh so it'll be much easier."Excelente, in that case we need to leave right now.", Camilla replied."I'm going too!", Mirabelle stated as Camilla and Lyca turned to her."Mira...are you sure? You don't like to fight and-", Lyca started before Mirabelle interrupts."I know, Lyca!", Mirabelle started then looking up with determined eyes, "but I refuse to sit by and let everyone do everything and I do NOTHING while my Dear's life is in danger! NEVER AGAIN! Even if it's not fighting, I WILL protect him!"Camilla and Lyca pause before smiling at her."We'll watch each other's backs! We'll gang up on her!", Lyca stated pumping her fists."That is right! Now vomonos, we have no time to waste here.", Camilla stated heading to the door with Mirabelle and Lyca following her lead."HEY, stop for a second!", Sterling says putting himself in front of them, "None of you have any idea what you're in for! How do you know it's JUST the Angel?""If does not matter! Human, Angel, they took mi Destino. I'm going to kill them all.", Camilla says every word laced with venom. Mirabelle's eyes widened in concern."Now step aside or I will move ju myself.", Camilla stated down at Sterling. Ein steps to Camilla's side."Are you threatening me? I'm trying to help you? You have NO IDEA who or what you're up against!""I'M GOING TO KILL THEM ALL!", Camilla yelled in her demonic voice. Startling Mirabelle and Lyca and even unnerving Sterling, "Now. Move.""Whoa whoa, hey!", Ein rushes to Camilla's side, " I need you to strongly consider what you're doing. Sterling IS right, we don't know what to expect. You could make this a whole lot worse for everyone, especially Mr. Bizzell.", Ein says."It's likely the Angel is working with the Malones. She incapacitated and captured him so obviously they're keeping him alive...for now.", Drei added raising herself up into a sitting position."Then means we cannot wait here!", Camilla stated."Who knows what they're doing to Chief right now!", Lyca added."I understand but we have to consider how long it would take US to get to him. Drei said she flew off with. We can't even be sure they haven't left the state. It's bad enough if we let you act within the state as exchange students it'll be even worse in another state with legal permission to be there.", Ein explained to Camilla as she gave a thoughtful yet frustrated expression. She clenches her fists shooting one last glare at Sterling before backing away."Trust us Ms. Sartana, I understand how you, Kessler and Marequine feel. I really do. But you have to understand that THIS is the best chance of getting Bizzel back safe.", Sterling says"I have no reason to trust ju.", Camilla scoffs, "It must be easy for humans. Ju do not know how cruel those filthy Angels can truly be!"Sterling was about to say something but Mirabelle approaches Camilla."Camilla, listen, I hate this just as much as you. However, we can't afford to be reckless right now.", She says earning a shocked look from Camilla and Lyca."Mira! What are you saying?! We have to save chief, don't you trust me?!", Lyca says with a hurt look."Senora, ju cannot put so much faith in these humans and their laws!" , Camilla added equally shocked.Sterling steps, "Thank you Ms. Marequine, I'm glad you at least-""I'm not finished!", Mirabelle stated firmly, "You said, it'll be 1 hour until backup MON forces arrive?""That's correct, yes.", he answers raising an eyebrow."Well then, in that case, we'll given them 30 minutes and they aren't here in that time, WE are leaving. I'll put my faith in Lyca's tracking skills, Camilla's power, and myself to rescue Caleb. Ein and Zwei will be the ones to arrest whatever criminals come our way but we'll focus only on Dear." Mirabelle stated with a serious look in her eyes. This earned shocked stares from everyone."Are you kidding me?! DO you have any idea what you're saying?!", Sterling yells starting to lose his patience, "All I'm trying to do is keep all of you safe. The least you can is work with me here!""Yes, I do Sterling. I'm aware of the danger but...I have to at least try! We'll hold off for now so please contact them telling them it's imperative they arrive immediately. Camilla, Lyca, are you both fine with waiting a bit?", Mirabelle asks them."I still believe we should leave now but...for ju Señora, I am willing to give this team of his a little time.", Camilla reluctantly agreed."Ok Mira, I...I trust you." Lyca utters in a worried tone."Then it's settled. We wait for now and if nothing changes, we're going after him.", Mirabelle says to Sterling who gives a shocked look trying to collect himself.Lyca holds her shoulders securely; her imagination racing on what could be happening to her Cheif right now. Zwei then approaches her giving a firm slap on her back making her stumble and yelp in surprise before turning to Zwei in confusion."Why are you getting all timid and fearful all of a sudden? You're a predator, hold her chin up. We're going to rescue him, ok? And we won't let anything happen to any of you either, just hold on for now.", Zwei whispers assuringly earning a thankful grin from Lyca."Zwei, I heard that! What that are you talking about?! We CAN'T let them go on their own!", Ein scolds incredulously."Sis, look at them.", Zwei stated pulling Ein closer pointing to Caleb's houseguests. She sees the determined yet slightly afraid expressions of each of their, "This ladies love this guy and will do anything to protect him. Anything. Even if it means making God knows how many enemies, getting who knows how hurt, to do so. Our moms would do the same for dad. How is this any different?", the last part caught Ein off gaurd."I-it IS different Zwei. None of them are with him right now so there's a much bigger chance he'll...!","What?!", came the irate voice of Camilla. Ein turned and flinches seeing her face contorted in a vicious, monstrous scowl with her glowing red eyes piercing her soul and sharpened teeth bared. She literally LOOKS like hell right now, "He will be WHAT?!"Ein hesitantly responds, "He'll...um...I mean...Look! I'm with Sterling, we can't afford to be reckless when lives are on the line. We're all afraid, not just you! If we're going to rescue him, we need to do so in a way that minimizes as much damage as possible.""Thank you very much, Ms. Ein.", Sterling thanks her."Of course sir.", she replies."Teacher's pet.", Drei says earning a surprised look from Ein."Drei? Why would you say that?", Ein inquires in a slightly hurt tone, "I'm sure you agree that we need to do this delicately.""Right...because the Angel who attacked us was very delicate in leaving me to bleed to death in a park children play in.", Dre spoke dryly.Ein and the others pause for a moment."In fact, from what I could tell, she appears to be the impatient type. Whatever we're going to do, it should be done soon.", Drei added.Mirabelle, Camilla and Lyca turned to each other with worried glances. Zwei and Ein turned to each other quizzically."HAAARHhhghhh! Dammit!", Sterling groans dialing a number on his phone, "I can't believe I'm-Yes, hello? This is Agent Sterling of the Huntsville branch. Yes, unfortunately certain...circumstances have changed and it's urgent they arrive within the next 30 minutes! YES, I KNOW BUT WE'RE THINGS HAVE CHANGED!"...Meanwhile..." *cough* * cough* *hack* ...uuuuuhh-AH-AHHHHHHHHHHHH!, ", Caleb screams as Azaeli hits him with another spell. His body spasmed and convulsed in agony as golden electric sparks ran through every inch of his body. Azaeli stood with an amused smirk and a yellow magic seal in front of her palm firing a stream of golden lightning."Ahhh come on now Bizzell, I'm not even using the higher level spells yet. Is that really allll you can handle Devil-lover?", Azaeli mocks. She closes her palm allowing the seal to disappear along with the lightning. Caleb elicits a sharp gasp and coughs finally catching his breath. Every muscle even his body felt like was slammed with a hammer. His insides were on fire like acid was melting his organs. He coughs up a little blood with a little spurt getting on Azaeli's snow-white jeans. Azaeli scowls in disgust."HEY, what the hell are you doing? These are two-thousand dollar custom made designer Arachne silk fiber jeans asshole!", Azaeli yells before backhand slapping Caleb. She pulls at the hem looking in annoyance as the blood stain spreads out seeping into the fabric, "Great, juuuust great! Right near the inner thigh. Looks like I just had my period and barely cleaned up. Yet ANOTHER thing you ruined you piece of shit!", Azaeli rants at him before punching Caleb in the gut. He recoils coughing up another spurt of blood."SHIT! SHIT! Did NOT think that through!", Azaeli exclaims immediately jumping back a few feet protecting any more of her outfit from getting ruined."*cough* Why?", Caleb uttered breathlessly, "Why are you...doing this...to me?"Azaeli raises an eyebrow, "Oh? The insect wants to know why he's being punished. Well aside from the obvious of being a Devil-lover, I would say...RUINING MY TRADE BUSINESS!""Haaa...trade...business? What?", Caleb utters weakly."Ughh, maybe it's better I show you.", Azaeli says pulling out a small black card. A tiny yellow Hebrew seal appears on it. Suddenly, the card transforms spreading outwards in a large black sack turned top-side down and it's contents spill out into a medium sized pile.Caleb looked at the pile of various guns from pistols to assault rifles, ammunition rounds, large hunting knives, and...collars litter the pile. He looks up at her."Impressive I know. It's amazing what affects a simple enhancement or charm spell can having on your species technology. It also helps that I have strong work ethic. I've made quite a fortune for myself selling my merch to top buyers.", Azaeli picks up a collar, "And you wouldn't believe how many love these! I can't blame them. Who wouldn't want their personal servant?"Caleb eyes widen in shock, "Y-you...you made those collars? The one...ack...that was on Camilla...and her friends haaa...?"Hoho. So they used my collars on those devils you stole from them. Which means that demoness of yours was one of them! Haaa, damn it's a small world.", Azaeli stated busting the case wide open."You...you sold those awful things to those crimina-GAAAHHH!", Caleb stated before being zapped with another dose of lightning magic."Those 'criminals' are the 'Malone family' and happen to be my highest paying clients.", Azaeli stops the spells as Caleb is left wheezing and coughing with smoke coming from his body, "and BECAUSE of you're little stunt, they, along with my other clients are on constant watch by ICEP making it harder for dealers like me to move my shit! You single handedly fucked my profits in the ass! This making sense? Huh?! Supply and demand? I got the SUPPLY but the DEMAND is dead!""Is...that...why...your doing...this? *cough cough* Money? You sold...this stuff...that hurt and ruined countless lives...for money?", Caleb utters through ragged breathing."Pfft, countless lives? Try lives nobody really cares about. The only reason you humans care about liminals and each other, is because there's something you can benefit from them. Ok, I'm just a small business owner working independently and surviving on her own. Even mother can at least agree with that much.", Azaeli's mumured the last part looking off in thought."Speaking of business, I have to finish mine. See, I'm not the only one you fucked. See him?", Azaeli shows her smartphone in Caleb's face with an online news article with Wick, "His execution is today, in about 2 hours from now and his uncle paid my to find and kill you then deliver your head for the other half.",Caleb's feels his stomach sink in fear as his mouth hung agape trying comprehending his situation."Now, I'm no assassin, but sometimes business can be cutthroat.", Azaeli straightens her fingers and a glowing yellow aura appears before condensing into a rippling blade of energy. Suddenly her wings begin changing from white to net black as Caleb's eyes widened in shock, "But I'm more than willing to cut some throats to get ahead.", She says holding the blade close to Caleb neck staring with sadistic glare. Caleb trembles shutting his eyes in fear with tears forming in the corners as her feels the intense heat from the blade.Then Caleb feels her remove the blade. He cracks his eyes open and they shot widen when he saw himself staring into the barrel of a pistol. Azaeli smiles gleefully shoving it between his eyes with her finger on the trigger."Or maybe you'd prefer a bullet to the head?!", She chuckles wickedly as Caleb tenses up horror. The memory of Wick shooting him replays in his mind. His breathing became erratic, his heart pounded out of his chest, and he felt he was either going to throw up, "Oh! Or maybe you'd like it this way! I'm sure Nikolai wouldn't mind a little hole." She jeered shoving the barrel in his mouth making him gag."Hmmm, actually, that gives me an idea.", Azaeli says removing the pistols from his mouth as her coughs profusely. She takes out her phone again, "I gotta go make a quick phone call. Don't go anywhere now hah!", says walking to a nearby door and exiting the room."Haa...haa...haa...haa...", Caleb tries to catch his breath. He attempts to move his hands only to find his arms had numbed from hanging for so long. His body ached with immeasurable pain with every move he made sending a sting through his nerves. He wonders is this really how he'll die? Even after finally being honest with himself? He won't be able to face Mirabelle and the others again, now that he's resolved to make things right? He hangs his head low as tears start flowing and a choked sob escapes his lips."Pssst"Caleb sniffles raising his head at the sudden sound."Pssssssssst Calebbbb, up herrrre!", the voice whispers again louder this time.Caleb looks around to find the source before looking as paused seeing a familiar bundle of yellow light behind a hanging bulbless fluorescent light fixture. It float down in front of his face and it's revealed to be Filo."F-Filo...?", Caleb mutters in surprise."Yes, don't worrrry! I'm gonna get you ouuut of here.", Filo says with a determined look before flying up to cuffs his chains where wrists were bound."Wh-H-How are you here?", Caleb asks"Oof, I hitch a ride inside oof of her jacket after she oof trapped you inside that picture thingy.", Filo explains as she kicks at the latch to hopefully break it, "I've been hiding here the whollllle time. I-I've...seen...and heard everything she's done to youuuu. I was just too scared to move! This is all my fault! I-If I hadn't said that to you...", Filo weeps sadly clutching the edge of the collar with her ruby fingers."Filo...it's ok, I forgive you and...we'll work things out later. Agh but we need to...find a way to... escape first!", Caleb says weakly."I-I can't break the loccck. It's protected by some type of magic barrierrrrrr. I'm sorry.", Filo apologized."It's...alright. M-maybe ugh...you can try and get help...haa...maybe fly down there and get help..." Caleb huffed trying not to stay awake."I can't be sure they'll belieeeeve me or if they'll get help in time to rescue us.", Filo stated before her forehead blinked getting an idea, "Wait, your phonnne! I remember her taking it off you and tossing it...over therrrre! Did you install the MON emergency app?""Y-yeah...I think so.", Caleb utters."I'll go check! Just hannnng on!", Filo says before flying off to where his phone landed; underneath the single car at the edge of the lot. She immediately finds it turned face-down in the concrete. She turns it over and is shock be the spread of cracks in the top left corner."Pleasssse, pleassssse turn on.", Filo prays holding down the power button. After a few seconds, it lights up; much to her relief. It's slow but it eventually shows the lock screen. Luckily for her, in her time spying on Caleb and the others, she saw many time how he unlocked it. She copies the pattern drawing it with her leg and the phone unlocks. She fist pumps victoriously as the home screen displays the apps. She instantly locates the MON emergency app: a yellow and black icon with M-O-N in bold font( kindly ugly design). She presses it and the screen changes as the app open showing a single button to send out a distress signal and she immadiately presses it. However, her celebration is short lived as an error message pops displaying the words 'Network not found.'. She frown then looks at the phone signal in the top right and sees there are not bars."Dammiiit!", Filo utters pulling her hair in frustration. She then picks up the phone with the screen facing towards her; her knees trembling from the weight as she carries it out from under the car hoping to get a signal. She carries it near the opening to the outside. A single bar appears. She smiles leaning the phone against the concrete wall then taps and holds the distress signal again. The screen makes a sonar effect before reading 'SIGNAL RECEIVED' glowing in green."Yes, oop!", Filo exclaims before quickly covering her mouth as not to be heard....Elsewhere...Mirabelle and the others were all sitting around the living room with an air of tension surrounding them. Lyca gripped the couch cushion, digging her claws into the fabric in frustration. Camilla sat back into the couch arms folded and legs crossed with an agitated scowl on her shut eyes. Mirabelle is next to her, clutching them of her skirt wondering is she made the right decision or if Caleb is about to die and she's sitting doing nothing. Again. She shakes her head trying to drive the thought from her mind. Drei and Ein were is sitting at the counter with Drei's MON issued laptop going through any files and data on the Angel they encountered along with records on areas Malone dealings had occurred in the last month. Zwei was busy organizing her assortment of kunai knives, pellet bombs, ropes, and throwing stars, in different pouches in her outfit preparing for battle. Sterling watched with unease at the girls sitting on the couch knowing if the MON team didn't arrive soon he'd have a hard time trying to stop them from going on their own. Not only that, he realizes he Filo is also nowhere to be found. Did something happen to her as well?Suddenly, his phone starts buzzing accompanied by an alarm similar to and AMBER alert. Immediately, Drei's laptop along with her's and her sisters phones start making the same sound. The noise filling the entire area. Sterling pull it out seeing the 'MON emergency distress logo with Drei's computer making the same sound."Arghhhh, Apaga la raqueta(shut off that racket!)! What is that?!", Camilla groans in annoyance holding her ears."Shut it off already!", Lyca stated holding her ears as well."Please!", Mirabelle added clutching the sides of her head."It'll stop soon! It's a MON distress signal!", Sterling replies, "Someone must have activated the app.""Who could have activated it. That app hasn't even been released to the public yet.", Ein added."I don't know, maybe LOOK at the location it's coming from?", Drei says showing the map on her computer with a red spot making a ripple effect, "and look who sent the signal."Ein, Sterling, and Zwei check their phones as the alarm stops for each of them. Their eyes shot wide." Host-089? That's Mr. Bizzell's phone!", Ein stated as Mirabelle, Lyca, and Camilla whipped their heads towards her and each shot up one by one."I can see his location! 3616 Holmes Avenue North West, that's downtown!", Sterling added."The signal's coming from that area here. It looks like some kind of public parking garage.", Dre says."I've been on that street before. It's only a 15 minute drive from here and only 10 miles from where our local MON units have been deployed during the Malone execution! No doubt they got the signal as well.", Sterling stated feeling maybe things will work out after all."Then what are we waiting for?! Let's go get Chief!", Lyca stated. Sterling spoke too soon."Si, vamos ahora( Yes, let's go right now!)", Camilla added rounding the couch with Lyca following. Mirabelle hops up as well to join them.Sterling puts himself between them and the door, "Stop! All of you! Just let MON and I handle this!""Why?! We know where he is! What is the point waiting around when he's so close?!", Camilla asks incredulously."It's BECAUSE he's so close that makes it more dangerous!", Sterling stated, "And you all agreed to wait a half hour! It hasn't even been 15 minutes yet!""We know Sterling...", Mirabelle replies, "And I thought I could hold out until then. But I can't. Not when I know Dear is in danger and practically down the street from me! I'm sorry Sterling but we can't wait. I can't do that to my Dear Caleb!""Ms. Marequine, what's gotten into you?! I expect you to see I'M at least trying to help you!", Sterling replies in disbelief."Ju are only trying to help yourself! Now move from the door or I go through ju and IT!", Camilla stated holding up her palm with a red magic seal. Mirabelle turns to Camilla with a worried expression."No, wait, Camilla please! You have to do that.", Mirabelle says laying her hands to Camilla's arm. Camilla is unflinching and doesn't tear her eyes away from Sterling. Whom to her, is just another man in the way of her life.Suddeny a large blade obscures Camilla's vision before lowering to her throat. She turns her head slightly and sees Ein next to her with a serious expression and her bone-like blade extended ready to strike."Listen to Ms. Marequine, lower your hand now and back away from or I will be forced to subdue you!", Ein stated firmly.Camilla turns to Ein raising her other arm forming a second red magic seal,, "I'd like to see you try little girl.""Hey! You heard her! If I were you, I'd comply!", Zwei state brandishing her own scythes ready to fire an attack."Zwei! What are you doing?!", Lyca stated with a shocked look. Zwei demeanor faulters a bit lowering her blades slightly but still keeps them pointed towards Camilla."STOP THIS, all of you! What does any of this prove turning on each other?!", Sterling shouted clearly fed-up with their behavior.Mirabelle looks between all of them in panic, like a child watching their parents fighting and don't how to make them stop, she holds her head trying to compose her sense....Back to Caleb...Filo flutters up to Caleb face with a smile on her face."I did it. I sent out a distress signalllll!", She says"Good...agh...thank you Filo.", Caleb says mustering a small grin but visibly wincing. Filo frowns knowing he was in terrible pain. She could feel it after all.Filo lays a hand on the tip of his nose, "Hang on a little longer, ok? I knowwww you can. Please?"Suddenly, the door opens."Alrighty then!", Azaeli announced as Filo gasps and flies up to light fixture above them to hide, "Ok, see you in a minute."Azaeli turns to Caleb with a malicous grin, "Guess what boiiii? Looks like i'm not going to be your executioner. I'm giving that up to old Nikolai himself. I just had him pay me double for the honor of killing YOU with his own hands AND at the same time his nephew is dying. Poetic justice at it's finest! So lets just sit tight until this associate of his gets here.", she says walking towards him, "Be grateful, I just prolonged your short, sad life by 15 minutes.""Hahhh...yeah, reallll grateful.", Caleb utters rolling his eyes in defiance. Azaeli notices this sudden change in behavior and grimaces."Oh. You've got some lip all of a sudden. Pfft, doesn't matter. Doesn't matter at all.", Azaeli scoff. She then hears the sound of the people below them singing church hymns and really having a good service. She turns up her nose feeling sickened."You're just like the insect down there. Blissfully ignorant and eager to get from something stupid to nothing at all. Everyday repeating the same mistakes as the jackass before them and doing all kinds of fucked up shit. Yet still they pray, still they worship, still hoping for change that'll never come.", Azaeli says turning to Caleb with a serious look, "And my people are expected to be your 'guardians' and 'protectors' and shit? Just because God created you in His image and we're expected nothing in return from being your caretakers? My own parents believe in that crap. Ever since I was a kid, they were always busy helping you insects and saying we should ALWAYS be humble. Even if it meant we became poor because of it. Even though we're vastly superior to you insects and especially Devils! I wanted better, I DESERVED better, so I took it and it felt great. Afterwards, they decide to disown ME?! Because I decide to take my rightful place?! WE'LL SCREW THEM! They're losers! But I have EVERYTHING I could ever want; money, freedom, adoration! And it feels DAMN good!", Azaeli chortled haughty smile.Caleb raises his head with a skeptical look, "So, do...your parents have black wings too?"Azaeli smile vanishes before she turn to Caleb. He gulped afraid he just stepped on a landmine. She walks up to him and roughly grabs his cheeks."Never. Mention. My wings.", Azaeli warns her eyes taking on a reddish-gold hue as she stared at him with pure rage. Caleb feels another surge of fear flows through him.*bang bang bang* came from the door Azaeli came through as the Angel turns her head in it's direction. It opens and a man pokes his head out."Hey! Is that Azaeli chick here?!", he whispered loudly"Over here idiot.", Azaeli spoke in an unamused tone.He walks in and closes the door looking around. He was fair skinned with a skinny build, light brown hair, and a buzz cut beard and mustache. He wore faded blue jeans, a brown camo shirt, red sneakers, and had different pattern tattoos on both arms. He carried a black drawstring bag. He walks over to where Azaeli and Caleb were with a surprised look on his face."Whoa, that Malone guy didn't say you were an Angel.", the man say and Azaeli rolls her eyes.The man notices Caleb behind her suspended by chains, "So that's the guy huh? He looked taller on tv.""Life is full of disappointment.", Azaeli replied, " Now can please get on with task...er my child.", She says putting on an air of divinity."Right! Sorry ma'am. Ok, he gave me the instructions on how to do this.", he says taking out a small sheet of paper and reading it. He then takes a cylindrical box of salt and a sharpie marker from the drawstring. He proceeds to draw medium circle with a pentagram then takes the salt and pour a small pile on each point. He takes a safety pin and pricks his finger, flinching a bit, then squeezes a single drop on each salt pile."Are you almost done?", Azaeli ask impatiently tapping her foot."Yeah, I just gotta...say this to uh...summon her.", The man turns the paper around to the back and begins, "Fantina. Fantina. Oh lovely Fantina, proud campaigner of small stature and frame. If you think it's obscene-a to love girls like Fantina, well you can die in a flame?", The man finishes with a confused look. At the moment, the lines of the circle below him began glowing bright purple. The man jumps back startled when the little salt mounds burst into purple flames.Azaeli watched in intrigue at the spectacle. Caleb and Filo stared in surprise when the flames fused together into a glowing purple ball before stretching out tall and spreading out in a rippling purple hole that distorted the very space around it. Caleb eyes widened when a small liminal girl with goat horns, goat hooves, brown hair with light tan skin and... wearing slightly skimpy attire of chain bra with red pads over her nipples and a tan miniskirt. She was also carrying a small scythe attached to her back. Suddenly, another person stepped through the portal. It was a fair-skinned human man with slight husky build. He looked to be near his 50s. He had black hair with lines of grey near the top and was receding. He was dressed in a black suit jacket with red dress shirt underneath, fine black leather dress shoes, and carrying a black suitcase."Good work scrub. I rarely ever get enough people to use that spell. It's simultaneously satisfying...and quite disappointing.", she says in a humdrum tone."Hey there Nikolai! It's been awhile since I've seen ya in person. And if it isn't the goat loli herself, Fantina. How ya been? Get new followers for your cause?", Azaeli greets with a taunting grin."No.", Fantina narrows her eye in annoyance, "Still a parasite on the world's colon I see. Quite fitting for a girl fallen so short of grace."Azaeli and Fantina glare at each other."Nikolai, you realize Mama Rose is going to be furious if she finds out you acted without her say so.", Azaeli stated."Do not worry. With some explaning, she understand and perhaps be grateful.", He replied."Too bad you have to rely on scum like this to get it done.", Azaeli says looking right at Azaeli."Whatever bitch, anyway, here's your guy!", Azaeli scoffs before gesturing to Caleb. Nikolai focuses on Caleb, who tenses up seeing the hate-filled rage in the man's eyes. He move toward Caleb looking in disgust as he eyed him up and down. He sets the suitcase down in front of him."So, this is the famous Bizzell.", He spoke with a heavy Russian accent before bending to make eye contact, "You caused a lot of trouble for my family. You svolach (Russian for 'garbage'). You...thief!", Nikolai takes out a large knife and Caleb blood runs cold, "YOU...MURDERER OF NEPHEWS!"Nikolai roughly grabs Caleb's head forcing in backwards and placing the blade at his neck as the cold steel touches his skin just under his Adam's appe. Caleb gasp and wheezes taking all of his concentration not to swallow or cough."Uhhh, Nikolai. I know you're busy taking revenge and all buuuut can I have the other half of my money now?", Azaeli asks as politely as she could muster.Nikolai glances back at her then to Caleb. He wanted to finish him right now but knew it would break his family's code of conduct when in comes to handling business. He reluctantly releases Caleb putting the knife away for now. He pick up the case in front of him."Of course, izvineniya.", he say in a polite tone opening up the case, "For you.", he presents her the open case filled with stacks of hundred dollar bills.Azaeli's eye twinkle in amazement with a wide-mouthed grin plastered on her face, "Haaaaaaaaaa", she utters"$500,000, all there.", Nikolai say handing her to case which she happily took."It's like looking into the face of god.", she whispers as a tear forms in her eye.Fantina approaches Caleb from the side with an unimpressed look and says, "To think, ICEP made all this fuss because of one guy. That got me wondering what so special about him? He's not even that cute. He's just...plain.", Fantina says examining him. Caleb looks back at her with a scowl, and soon as they make eye contact, Fantina feels a tinge in the back of her neck."Well you shouldn't have gotten your hopes up. He's just another downer like the rest.", Azaeli shrugs dangling the case on her open palm."Actually...there could be something notable after all.", Fantina says with her finger to her chin in thought as Nikolai and Azaeli give fer puzzled looks, "Just now...I felt tinge of strong magical energy near him."Nikolai and Azaeli give surprised looks."Pffft, no way! It's probably just your imagination. You know humans suck at using magic. Their brains aren't equipped to handle the flow of mana.", Azaeli replies."Hmm, true. It may have been my mind playing tricks but...", Fantina pondered for a second for her eyes widen in realization. She turns to Azaeli with a serious look, "Wait! You made absolutely no one tailed you right?! Not a single soul is in this level of the building?!"Nikolai eyes widen in shock and Azaeli recoils feeling offended, "What do take me for an amateur?! No one ever uses this lot on Sundays, ever!""Well I have a feeling being watched.", Fantina stated before she takes of her small scythe and it grows to twice her size before a grey aura enshrouds it and her entire body, "Allow me to check if this place is REALLY as secluded as you say."Fantina bangs the bottom of her scythe against the ground and a wave of grey colored energy spreads throughout the top floor washing over everyone and everything. Azaeli, Nikolai , and Caleb feel their bodies tingle as it washes over them. Suddenly, they here a small but shrill scream.Caleb feels something hit the top of his head. He lifts his head and two, tiny slim legs dangle in between his eyes. He sees Fantina and the others staring at him in surpise and anger."So, looks like we've got a nosy little fairy in our midst.", Fantina spoke coldly."Bozhe ty moy( My god.)", Nikolai uttered in shock.Filo gasp hastily climbing up on Caleb's head and quickly tries flying away as fast as she can."Oh no you don't!", Azaeli stated in anger before catching Filo by her legs midflight. Filo desperately tries to out of her grip like a fly caught by it's leg. Azaeli puts the case down before clunching Filo's tiny body in her free hand. She struggles and wriggles before Azaeli gives her a light squeeze letting Filo know she's at the Angel's mercy."W-Wait, stop! Pl-ARGH!", Caleb utters only for Nikolai silence him with a punch across the face."Zakroy svoy chertov rot, I get to you soon. First we, deal with this.", Nikolai points to Filo in Azaeli's hand."Awww, what's wrong? Mad that we found your friend. Gotta say not much of a rescue party but deserving for an insect to have insects for friends.", Azaeli taunts as she holds Filo up to Caleb's face, "Let me handle this Nikolai. You just keeping thinking of the many ways you'll kill him.""I've had plenty of time for that. Hurry up!", Nikolai stated."Ptew, haaarghhh...", Caleb spits out a clump of blood."Calebbbb! Leave him alone you bastarrrds!", Filo yells as Caleb weakly look up blood still dripping from his mouth."Ok, how about I focus on you then?!", Azaeli say. Filo whines as she's forcefully reposition in Azaeli's hand exposing her wings. Azaeli grin wickedly. Filo eyes widen as she feels one of her wings being stretched, "She loves you.", she says before tearing off Filo's wing."HYAHHHHHHHHHH!", Filo shrieks in agony as the first wing falls to the floor. Caleb eyes shot wide in horror."She love you not. She loves you. She loves you not.", Azaeli sung as Filo screamed and writhed in her grasp with every wing she tore off. , "Aww, she loves you!", Azaeli stated tearing off the final wing. Filo's blood pouring from her and staining Azaeli's fingers."AHHAHHAHHHAHHHHH HAHHHHAHH!", Filo continued shrieking as tears flowed down her face.Caleb flails his body trying in a fruitless attempt to free himself, "Stop! Stop it! She didn't do anything!", he pleaded."I beg to differ. In fact, I'd say she's just as guilty for trying to save an insect like you.", Azaeli says holding Filo's body with both hands stretching her body by both arms T-posing fashion in front of Caleb's face, "So I think it's fair she receives her punishment as well."Filo whimpers and snivels weakly looking up at Caleb. His heart stops seeing the agony in her face. She whispers trying to say something when...*SNAP*"AGGHHHHH HAHHH", Filo scream loudly as Caleb clenches his teeth, eyes widenig again from seeing Azaeli break Filo's right arm."Oooh, that kinda sounded like a wishbone.", Azaeli chortles as Filo kicked her legs desperate to escape her tormentor. She looks Caleb in his trembling, teary eyes and grins, "Go ahead, i'll let you have the next wish."Caleb's words get caught in his sobs make him utter unintelligible whimpers and his mind shut down in despair."No? Ok, i'll make the next one!", She chuckles before snapping Filo's other arm eliciting more intense screams from the little Fairy."Please! Stop!", Caleb cries as tears stream down his face in choked sobs. Nikolai crosses his arms a smirk crossing his lips as Fantina turns away in disgust completely above this behavior, "Please. Just put her down!""Heh, if you insist.", Azaeli say before opening her hands allowing Filo's lifeless body fall to the concrete. Caleb watches as she hits the ground her twitching. He looks up at Azaeli who shakes her head disapprovingly."Now look what you did. You made me get my hands dirty AND that little one had to DIE because of you! Just like poor Jakob! The only way for you to get any shred of integrity back is for YOU to die. That seems fair, doesn't it Nikolai?""Yes. Fair indeed.", Nikolai answers anxiously waiting for his turn.Caleb vision goes cloudy as their words reverberated in his mind. They were right. All of this was because of him. It started with his parents and it just keeps getting worse. So many people suffered and are still suffering...because of him. All he causes is suffering. His body slowly goes limp as he begins to accept that this is his fate. This...is what scum like him deserves."Yourrrr...wrong!", came the whispered voice of Filo. Caleb looks down to see Filo on her back breathing laboriously with her broken arms spread out, "Ca...leb...don't...listen! It's...NOT...yo...ur fault! None...o-of...this is. You...are NOT...them. You have...so much love...so much...strength...in your heart...and your soul. It's...beautiful. Ne...ver...lose...it...like she has."Caleb listens to intently to the little Fairy. His mouth hangs agape unable to find the right word."Aha excuse me? What was that tinker bell? Didn't catch that.", Azaeli says squatting down beside Filo. Filo weakly turns her head with an angry expression."Y...ou heard me! You...claim to have 'freedom...but it's a lie. You...are...a prisoner of your OWN greed! So...empty...so ho..llow inside...so consumed by your...selfishness...y..ou don't...even recognize it...a-as selfishness...anymore. I...bet...even your parent...knew it too! You're...so small.", Filo finished.Azaeli glares at the fairy who somehow manged to hit every nerve in her being. She looks up at Caleb with an agitated scowl and wordlessly stands up never breaking eye contact. She lifts up her right boot hovering it right over Filo's body as Caleb eyes widen in horror. Her foot slowly and agonizingly get closer to the Filo's body."Ca...leb.", Filo uttered, "I had fun...watching...over you all. Please...love each of those girls...as much as they love...you."*snap*Caleb jaw drops as the room goes completely quiet, outside of that awful sound, snap. Tears roll down his cheek as Azaeli removes her foot, revealing the now completely lifeless body of Filo."She was right you know.", Fantina says to Azaeli.Azaeli whips around with a furious expression, "SHUT UP BITCH! Nikolai, I'm done here! Here's all yours!"Then the guy from before runs up to them with Caleb's, "Guys! Guys, I-I-I think ICEP knows we're here! This thing says some kind of signal got sent out."The group pauses in shock."Good work you idiot girl.", Fantina scolds Azaeli"Fuck you! This isn't my fault! It was that stupid fairy of his!", Azaeli stated glaring at Filo's body then Caleb. She turns to Nikolai, "Nikolai your gonna have to make this revenge quick."Nikolai clenches his knife in frustration before approaching Caleb ready to avenge his nephew."bastards.", Caleb whispers as Nikolai, Azaeli, and Fantina turn to look at him. Caleb clenches his teeth glaring at them with pure rage, sadness, and despair flooding his mind. He then speaks louder, "Bastard. Bastards. Bastards! BASTARDS! BASTARD! BASTARDS!", he screams to the top of his lungs thrashing his body. Suddenly, the area on his chest begin glowing with a strong purple light. He glares at them as his pupils change from chocolate to a glowing bright purpleNikolai and Fantina's eyes widen in shock as they take a step back from him. Azaeli turns with utter befuddlement on her face."Wh-What the hell?!", Azaeli stated....Back at the house...Everyone was still at each others throats. Until.."HRRRGGHHH", Mirabelle exclaims clutching the sides of her head,"Senora?!", Camilla exclaims turns to Mirabelle lowering her arms. Sterling and the others focus on the Centaur.Bastards. Bastards! BASTARDS! BASTARDS!Mirabelle's eyes widen immediately hearing voice reverberate through her head."Mira! What's wrong?!", Lyca inquires"Caleb. I hear him! I hear him! Agh, I-I can feel it. All of it!", Mirabelle clutches her head backing and knocking over a few chairs and a glass cup shatters, "His anger! His grief! His pain!""Mirabelle, not making any sense! What are you talking about?!", Sterling said."I think she's having a nervous breakdown!", Ein stated."Senora, look at me, LOOK at me, it is going to be ok! I promise!", Camilla stated holding onto Mirabelle's shoulder as she thrashed. She kicks her back legs knocking one of the chairs across the floor.Ein holds down her lower half to keep her steady, "Ms. Sartana's right. We're here for you just come and lie down and-""NO! I have to go to him! I have to go to him NOW!", Mirabelle interrupted before as purple light completely enveloped her eye and a shimmering purple aura covers her entire body then washing over Camilla's and Ein's bodies and go into a trance.Drei and the others pause in shock as the purple light diffuses over the room.Suddenly, a large volume of purple mist emanates from Mirabelle's tail and enshrouds all three of them. Camilla shakes her head snapping out of the trance."SENORA-", was all Camilla could utter before being teleported along with Ein."The FUCK?!", Sterling stated....Back to Caleb..."What is this mana?! It's so intense!", Fantina exclaims as Azaeli and Nikolai back away unsure of what to do,"BASTARDS! I'LL KILL YOU BASTARDS!", Caleb screams as the purple light on his chest condenses into a bright purple flame on his chest as do his eyes. The golden light of the chain fades away and the chains break much to Azaeli's shock. Suddenly, the space behind Caleb distorts as purple mist emanated from it before Mirabelle appears behind him along with Camilla and Ein. Fantina, Azaeli, and Nikolai gasp in utter shock at the turn of events.Ein sharply inhales, "What the hell was that?! It felt like my entire body was being jammed inside tiny box!""She teleported us! But w-", Camilla stated before her eyes widen seeing Caleb on his knees bloody and chains on his wrists, "SENOR!"Ein regains her focus and is shocked at her current surround and even more shocked seeing Caleb."DEAR!", Mirabelle exclaims running over to Caleb."YOU AGAIN?!", Azaeli shouted as Camilla turned to her and immediate fury shot though."YOOUUUU! YOU DID THIS!", Camila shouted spreading her wings with eyes filled with murderous intent."Dear! I'm not here! I'll-", Mirabelle stops and gasps seeing Nikolai pick up an assault rifle, "NO!", she shouts throwing her hands up and purple dome-like barrier surrounds them."UMIRAYU VSEKH VAS( DIE ALL OF YOU!)", Nikolai shouted before firing off rounds at them only from the bullets to stop in their path upon hitting the shield and falling to the ground.Ein lunges upward and fires a small shockwave that shatters the rifle and send Nikolai stumbling back!"OH THE HELL WITH THIS I"M OUT!", The man from before runs for the door. Ein leaps off the walls sends another mini shockwave at the man's feet making him trip hit his head on the door and knocking him out. Azaeli spreads her wings gaining a bit of elevation before forming a magic seal this firing a stream of golden lighting. Camilla did the same but fire a stream of black lightning. Their attacks collide canceling each other out.Ein refocused on Nikolai and lunges toward him scythes bared for a knockout. Just then, her attack is deflected by Fantina's own scythe in a spray of sparks. Ein lands to her feet prepared to face her opponent. Nikolai stands"I think not. I can't have you damaging one of my meal tickets.", Fantina stated twirling her scythe."You must be with the Malone! I'm placing all of you under arrest!", Ein stated"A MON agent, huh? A cat with a scythe on it's arm? They're scraping the bottom of the barrel these days.", Fantina state shaking her head in disappointment."I'm no cat, I'm a WEASEL!",Ein stated firing another mini shockwave only for Fantina to block it with a small magic barrier of her own."Yeah, a shit weasel apparently.", Fantina chided to Ein's annoyance. Fantina's body surges with red aura before she vanishes in a blur of red to Ein's surprise. She reappears behind her about to decapitate her. But Ein sensed her in time and blocks it with her own scythe sending a clang of sparks. Fantina bounces off her arm, then off the cieling ready to strike again. Another clang of sparks as Ein intercept then goes for a high kick but Fantina dodges with a spin land on the edge of the building opening to the outside. She stands with a cocky smirk."And this is yet another reason why small frames rule. All that extra baggage and fat slows you down, leaves you open.", Fantina taunts.Ein blushes in embarrassment before recomposing herself and crossing her scythes like a upside-down T, "Hurricane-style: Cat-3 slash!", She quickly swipes her arm in a violin motion sending a shockwave that completely obliterates the concrete into dust underneath Fantina's hooves to her shock and leave a large rectangular hole. Fantina begins to fall. She smirks using her scythe to grab the edge, launch herself back up with the same red aura surrounding her. Her speed drastically increases, disappearing and reappearing faster than Ein could track. Suddenly she senses another attack, she blocks with a her scythe with clanging sparks but there was no Fantina just the scythe."Surprise!", Ein looks down to see Fantina holding a red glowing ball with black sparks pulsating from it. She releases it and Ein's elicits a pained scream as her body is lit up with red energy and black sparks. Suddenly, Fantina comes rocketing towards her ramming her horn into Ein's stomach. She coughs before being flying back and slamming hard into the wall. She keeps standing and glares at the baphomet taunting before getting another battle stance.Meanwhile, Azaeli and Camilla are engaged in their battle. Azaeli summons her seal and fires a barrage of yellow energy bolts at Camilla, who nullifies them by shielding herself with two blue magic seals, before firing a blue fireball at her. Azaeli obliterates it with a swipe of her hand. Azaeli flies towards Camilla sending a whip of yellow lightning at her. Camilla skillfully dodges as the attack rips through the concrete before creating an orange magic seal then doing an upward slash sending a claw shaped beam at her. Azaeli haults pulling up as the attack light grazes her before destroying part of the ceiling. Azaeli eyes widen seeing the large rip along her pants."OH NOW YOUR PAY DEVIL!", Azaeli shouted forming two golden magic seals that morph into the shape of buzzsaw blade that begin rotating, "I'll RIP YOU TO PIECES!", Azaeli shouts as she slashes as Camilla is able to dodge most of them only getting nicked a few time. Camilla finds her wings touching the wall. Azaeli smiles performing a spin move using her wings for extra momentum. Camilla jumps up, uses her wings to push off the wall, and performs a side flip as Azaeli's attack leaves a large slash mark in the concrete. Camilla lands grabbing Azaeli by her wing and throws her sending her into a concrete column. Azaeli groans on her hands and knees.Camilla examines a black feather in her hand, "I should figured as much. If it's one thing worse than a Angel it's a Fallen one.", Camilla spits on the wing tossing it away."I'm still better than you'll ever be filthy bitch! *bang*", Azaeli fires off a round from revolver she kept in her bra."GAH!", Camilla exclaims as the bullet gets her in the arm making her entire arm go limp. She holds as blood covers her hand and to her shock it doesn't heal right away."These bullets are imbued the enhancement magic. Good for piercing tough armor or temporarily nullifying healing factors.", Azaeli says firing a few more rounds at Camilla who managed to shields herself from them with a magic seal from her working hand. Azaeli suddenly appears in front of her, grabs Camilla by the hair, knees her in the stomach, before punching her square in the face.As the fighting ensured, Mirabelle continued to shield Caleb with her barrier. She looks toward the doors several feet away from them and their only escape."Dear! Come on, we have to get out of here!", Mirabelle says breaking the cuff on his hands with her hoof before helping him to his feet."Moon pie...Moon pie, I'm sorry.", Caleb apologizes, "I'm sorry..for lying to you. If...I don't make it...haa I want you to know that.", he spoke trying his best to stay conscious.Mirabelle's eyes widen before shaking her head and focusing, "You ARE going to make it Dear! You hear me? I'll protect you now, so you just stay with me, ok? Get on my back, now!"Caleb is taken aback but complies weakly mounting her back. The feeling in his arms still hasn't returned so Mirabelle holds him steady from behind; kinda like piggybacking. Mirabelle closes her eyes and concentrates trying to teleport."Come on, come on! Concentrate! Work, please!", Mirabelle concentrates as hard as she can to take them back home but, to no avail. She's never used this ability on such on long distance, this instance being pure luck. What was that surge of energy that went through her to make her do this?"You're not going anywhere!", Nikolai stated grabbing a shotgun from Azaeli's pile of weapons then cocking it. Mirabelle turns with a fearful expression as the burly old man approached. He takes aim at them."AH!", Mirabelle exclaims putting up another barrier as he fired on them."You think you can hide behind your horse girlfriend?! ", Nikolai stated firing another shot as Mirabelle flinches as her barrier weakens. What kind of bullets were these?! Mirabelle tries not to panic and focuses her mana as purple aura enraptured her body as well as Caleb's. The hoof mark on Caleb's chest immediately lights and he clenched his fingers gaining a bit of strength." You are going to pay for killing and shaming the only TRUE family I have! All of you will!", Nikolai stated firing another shot destroying the barrier to Mirabelle's horror. Camilla and Ein glance over at the in shock as Nikolai readies another shot."NO!", they exclaim before Nikolai lets off a shut at Mirabelle's head. Or...so he thought. Nikolai was shocked to see both Mirabelle and Caleb bodies dissolve into purple smoke."Well, I won't let you kill MY family!", Mirabelle stated as Nikolai is surprised to see they were now several feet behind him right at the door.Mirabelle tries to open but the unconscious man's body is blocking it. She reaches down grabbing him by the legs quickly trying to move him."AH! AHH!", suddenly the man awakens and jerks from her grasp scared by her appearance."AHHH!", Mirabelle shrieks rearing up slightly. Then she hers ears stand erect hearing the cocking of a gun. She gasps turning to see Nikolai with another assault rifle. The man at the door picks himself off the floor stumbling to his feet. Mirabelle instinctively puts a barrier around her and Caleb."DIE PURPLE BEAST!", Nikolai yells covering them in hail of bullets. Mirabelle manages to block most of them but some of the hit the man by the door in the chest killing him. Nikolai closes in on them."Moon pie!", Caleb stated holding onto her waist as the bullets knock against the shield. Mirabelle gives strained groan as she struggles to keep up the barrier. Suddenly the bullets stop as Nikolai ran out of bullets much to her relief. Her shield dissipates as she pants in exhaustion. Her relief is short lived when Nikolai stands in front of them.He grabs Caleb by the shirt collar and throws him to the ground. Caleb struggles as Nikolai presses his knee to into his stomach making him gag. Nikolai raises his large knife ready to strike Caleb's neck."NO!", Mirabelle exclaims grabbing Nikolai in a choke hold making him drop the knife to the concrete as Caleb picks himself up holding his stomach. Nikolai shakes and struggles in her grasp as Mirabelle held on as tight as she could. Nikolai then jabs her hard in the stomach."GAHH!", Mirabelle exclaims in pain releasing Nikolai. She hunches over holding her stomach before Nikolai slaps her hard to the ground as elicits a loud yelp...."SENORA!", Camilla calls in rage. She then refocuses just barely dodging another hit from Azaeli."Yeah! Get distracted! Make this much easier!", Azaeli chortled sending another bolt of gold lightning at her. Camilla shields with a large blue seal with her good arm. Azaeli flies upwards and does dives slamming into Camilla's shield with her boots. Camilla falls to one knee before noticing Azaeli smirking hold the revolver at her. Camilla flaps her wings carrying herself backwards and knocking Azaeli off balance causing her to fire and miss. Camilla creates a green magic seal and fires a dark green energy ball and explodes on impact with Azaeli's body. Camilla winced from the pain of the bullets still in her arm."Aghhh!", Azaeli elicits catching herself, "You're to pay for that!"Azaeli lunges towards Camilla creating a magic seal that forms into golden spiked knuckles. Camilla quickly creates a red seal that forms into red demonic claws. The clash with each other, dodging and each other's hits....Caleb's jaw drops in horror before clenching his teeth in anger seeing his girlfriend cringing on the floor"I don't know what kind of Centaur you are but you are in my way.", Nikolai stands over Mirabelle with a revolvers pointed at her head. She closes her eyes in fear. When suddenly.."GYAHHHH", Nikolai screams out. Mirabelle looks up and is shocked to see Caleb clutching the back of the old man's neck as his arched his back in anguish. Caleb twist the back of his arm actually breaking his wrist before performing a judo throw flips and sends Nikolai flying back several feet and slamming into the floor. Everyone in the room looks over to what happened and is shocked at seeing Caleb body emitting a faint purple aura, eyes glowing bright purple, and ankle emitting a light purple mist. His expression is stiff and cold. Nikolai grunts and wheezes picking himself up on his hands and knees. Caleb jogs getting a running start before going into a full sprint. Nikolai pants pointing the revolver at Caleb and fires. Caleb to disappears leaving a trail of glowing purple mist behind before reappearing on the opposite side kneeing Nikolai square in the head knocking him out. The purple aura fades and his eyes return to normal as Caleb collapses to his knees the falling to the floor unconcious.Mirabelle picks herself up and run to him, "DEAR!""Nikolai!", Fantina exclaims attempting to teleport only for Ein to delivers a swift kick knocking her back and breaking her concentration." I suggest you focus on your opponent.", Ein stated while looking down on her. Fantina glared at her before the sounds of sirens caught her attention, "It looks like this is the end of the line for you three. Give yourselves up now and maybe they'll go easy on you!"Fantina looks down at the police and Mon vans pulling along the street, "Tch, another ICEP agent to blind to see the truth of this so called "all inclusive" organization.""What are you talking about?", Ein inquires."I mean...", Fantina says as a small red ball forms above Ein's head. She taps her scythe to the floor and the balls explode into glowing red net, " You should be mindful of the people around you. Some could be lying traps!""AHhhhhhhhhhhh", Ein screams as the net binds her body thrashes painful waves through it. Azaeli focuses her attention on Nikolai and raises her scythe. Suddenly, she feels a strong breeze blow behind and her ears twitch at sharp whistling sound. She quickly sides steps as a blade of air slices off a lock of her hair to her annoyance. She turns around and see two girls standing on the concrete opening. Both of similar in appearance to the liminal she just subdued; only smaller."Looks like we arrived on time.", Zwei stated." Or at least enough for the climax.", Drei quips taking noting the damages and the Angel and Devil still fighting."Perfect, more wannabe crusaders.", Fantina stated unamused."Yeah, and I WANNA be kicking your goat ass.", Zwei stated brandishing her scythes, "Drei, take care of Ein. I got this!"Drei pops open a vial, "and she was never heard from again.", She says before leaping over to Ein.Zwei jumps above Fantina, "Release our sisters! Whirlwind style: blade rain!", she exclaims spinning her body sending a barrage of wind blades at Fantina. Fantina's aura surges."Your anime attack names make no sense!", the baphomet exclaims skillfully twirling her scythe deflecting many of the air blades. Zwei land on her baring her scythes down and Fantina intercepts as even more spark fly from their interlocked blades. Fantina takes not that HER blades seem a lot sharper than that 'Ein' girl's, "RAGHHH! I don't have time for this!", Fantina stated sending Zwei flying back hitting the wall. Fantina turns to run but Drei throws a green ball that explodes into a sticky goo at her hoove making her fall and faceplant."Gah! Son of a bitch!", Fantina rubbing her forehead then reaching for her scythe; only for Zwei to kick it a foot away from her before forcefully pinning her arms behind her back. The net ensnaring Ein's body disappears and she groggily rolls over on her back. Drei then proceeds to apply her healing salve silently thanking the God. She really had no idea how to get that net off."You have the right to remain sucking!", Zwei taunted putting her weight on Fantinas back. Fantina groans in annoyance....Mirabelle cradles Caleb's head in her lap, "It's ok my love. I'm right here, I'm going anywhere.", she utters as he groans lowly greatly fatigued.The door of the room suddenly bursts open."FREEZE! Everyone get down on the ground now!", says a police officer in blue uniform pointing a gun. Sterling then appears from behind him showing his badge."Agent Sterling of ICEP! You are all under arrest!", He announces as Azaeli and Camilla stop fighting with the formers wearing a terrified expression; all of this being more than she bargained for. Fantina's ears twitch upon the mention of that name."Sterling, we captured one of them over here!", Zwei announces as she holds up Fantina face by the horns much to her discomfort. Sterling turns to them and his expression changes to surprise as he slowly lowers his badge. Fantina's eyes widen upon making eye contact."...Fantina?", Sterling uttered lowly. Fantina opens her mouth but has nothing to say."OH FUCK THIS!", Azaeli shouts before knocking Camilla back with her wing, grabbing her suitcase while forming a magic seal the size of her body. A large ball of golden energy forms before condensing into her palm before clenching her fist. Camilla raises up wiping the blood from her lip eyes widen in horror."EVERYONE TAKE COVER NOW!", Camilla shouted before Azaeli slams her palm to the concrete and a powerful shockwave of energy spreads throughout the area. Sterling instinctively pushes the other MON members and police officers from coming in. Mirabelle uses everything she has left to put a barrier around herself and Caleb. Fantina uses all her strength to push Zwei off of her then grab her scythe before teleporting away. Ein grabs both of her sisters pulling them into her body and leaping out the opening. The walls crack, pieces of concrete flying every which way. From outside the building, several people see a bright golden light burst from the entire top floor.The light soon fades and dusting from the concrete filling the area. A few concrete pillars had been destroyed, the walls and floor were broken apart with large chunks missing. By some miracle, the entire top flood hasn't caved in yet. Camilla emerges having protected herself with a large blue barrier. She sees Caleb and Mirabelle made out ok, much to her relief. She then hears rapid footsteps through the rubble accompanied by ecstatic laughter. Her eyes focus on Azaeli running away carrying the briefcase and spreading her wings preparing to take off. Camilla gets to her feet, stumbling at first, before sprinting after her. Azaeli leaps outsides wing spread as Camilla charges up whatever mana she has left into one spell. It was one she just picked up during her fight. A red magic seal forms before condensing into a large red glowing disk."Hahahaha, home free baby!", Azaeli exclaims happily holding the case to her chest as the people down below pointed in amazement. They, along with Azaeli, oblivious to the red eyed figure atop to highest floor of the parking garage.Camilla raises her arm expanding the disk larger. She takes aim narrowing her rage filled eyes and pulling her arm back. She hurls the large death saucer with all her might.Azaeli grins looking at the city in the distance wondering what she'll do now that she has a little over 1 million dollars when...*Slice* The disk cleaves off half of both of Azaeli's wing."AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!", Azaeli screams to the top of her lungs before her body slams right into the very top of the church with the large mounted cross and dropping the suitcase and tumbling down the roof breaking off tons of shingles and wood. She land's right on her back eliciting pain shrieks on her way down. Camilla pants before falling backwards in exhaustion."AH! AHHAAAAhaaaaaa!", Azaeli cries in agony as blood pools on her back. Above her, the large mounted cross, slides down having been knocked off it's foundation and and goes tumbling down. It bounces off a ledge and Azaeli looks up, her desperate eyes pleading for help, only to see a giant hunk metal coming down on her in the shape of a cross, A-AHHH-", was all Azaeli's could get out before it lands upside down with the top of the cross impaling her in the throat. It pins her to the ground as she convulses violently before eventually going still having choked on her own blood. Just then, the briefcase slides down the roof and gets it's latch caught on a piece of wood. It opens and it's contents spill out sending a confetti of hundred dollar bills raining down the street. The area floods with people from the church or just passersbys cheering and eagerly grabbing at the floating cash as police tried to get control of the crowd....7 hours later...The sound of beeping. The smell of sanitizer, chemicals, and antiseptics. The white marble floors and light green walls. The coldness throughout the area."Ugh...", Caleb mutters as his eyes fluttered open to what sounded like a heart monitor. He stirs feeling the soft surface under him and the thin sheet that thinks it's doing its job."Dear! You're awake!", came the voice of Mirabelle. He looks to the left and sees the purple centaur right by his bed clasping his hand."M-Moon pie? Where...where are we?""We're in a hospital Dear. You fell unconcious after fighting that man. They brought you here afterwards.", She explain.Caleb tries to sit up and is still weak but Mirabelle helps him up. He looks around seeing the entire layout before a thought occured, "Camilla, Lyca, where are they?"Mirabelle was about to answer when the door flies open."Mira, we got you a salad.", Lyca exclaims presenting a large container full of green goodness and dressing packets."Ju need to eat Senora if ju are going to heal properly?", Camilla adds.They both stop in their tracks eyes widening at seeing Caleb awake and sitting up. Lyca drops the container."SEÑOR!" "CHIEF!", both exclaims happily. Lyca jumps on the bed and wrap him in a hug as Caleb grits his teeth at the sudden soreness returning."L-L-Lyca, wait! Not so rough, he's still sore!", Mirabelle says frantically to get her off of him."Oh Chief, I'm so happy you're ok! We were so scared! We thought we were gonna lose you!", Lyca doesn't hear her and continued roughly nuzzling his chest; her tail wagging at a hundred miles an hour. Then her body starts glowing with blue aura and she feels light as a feather."Um, Señorita Lyca, I don't believe Señor is in the mood for snuggles right now.", Camilla spoke politely levitating the affectionate wolf off Caleb and sitting her on her knees."Ughhh, thanks Camilla.", Caleb utters circling his shoulder relieving some of the stiffness."Sorry.", Lyca apologizes resting her palms and head on the gaurd rails and looking up with sad puppy eyes."It's fine Lyca, I know you only mean well.", Caleb says laying a hand to her head petting her head. She smiles happily cooing at his touch."She is though. We were so worried Señor.", Camilla spoke holding back a sob placing a hand over her heart staring with softness in her red eyes before laying her other hand to his side."I'm so happy we got to you in time.", Mirabelle says clasping his other hand staring with sparkling violet eyes. He lightly squeezes her hand with as much as he could muster then clasps Camilla's with his other hand."Thank you girls, that means so much I...", Caleb stops when he sees the side of Mirabelle's face is bandaged with slight redness around her cheek. Then he sees Camilla's arm was bandaged from her shoulder to her joint, "W-what happened to the two of you?! Ack!", Caleb utter jerking himself up before sudden pain rips through his body."Easy Dear! I'm ok, we're ok. It's only a small scratch, really.", Mirabelle says touching her bandage."It is more like small hole for me. That perra (bitch) got me with an enhanced bullet to stopped the wound from regenerating. La enfermera(nurse) took it out of me but it will take for my arm to begin healing.", Camilla explains, "It is fine though! I'll just take a little longer to regenerate! That is all!"They both smile at him warmly letting him know they were fine. He weakly smiles back knowing they didn't want him to blame himself. He decides to change the subject, "Ok girls, so...what happened after I passed out? ""Quite a bit actually.", came the voice of Sterling. They turned to see him standing with the door wide open with the Zyklons poking their heads looking inside, "Where do you want me to start?""Sterling? Um...yeah...wherever is fine.", Caleb replies."Well, I arrived with backup only to be caught in a powerful explosion apparently caused by the Angel that abducted you. Afterwards, we found you all of you unconcious and brought you all in for treatment. Now here's the interesting part. It turns out one of people left unconcious was Nikolai Ivankov, a member of the Malone family and quite the business in the underground liminal trafficking. He was badly injured in the explosion with severe burns all over half his body. He's currently unconcious in the burn treatment ward with guards stationed near his room. We plan interrogate him when he comes to.", Sterling explains."He tried to kill me you know.", Caleb says plainly, "He claimed it was out of revenge for Jakob execution today.""I should have guessed as much. If it makes you feel any better, the execution went...well.", Sterling says hesitating a bit."No, it doesn't.", Caleb replies in a unamused tone, "What happened to the Angel? Azaeli, I think was her name."Camilla gives a plaintive look to Caleb."That's another thing. After that explosion, a few units on the ground saw a winged figured soar from the top of the building before crashing into a nearby church. They soon found her on the church grounds with her wings cut off and a large cross fixture impaled in her throat. She appeared to have died of suffocation and blood loss.", Sterling explains, " We...found several weapons and collars used on many liminal girls. After some digging, we found they were similar to ones found in locations and used by other criminals. It seems Ms. Azaeli had been supplying weapons and enslavement collars to the Malones and other criminals for years. We've begun developing measures to find and lock away as many of these as we can.""So...she's dead?", Caleb asks."Yes, She is Mr. Bizzell.", Sterling answers"Good.", Caleb replies earning a shocked look from many of them, especially Camilla."M-Mr. Bizzell...I know she was a criminal but...", Sterling says noticing the seriousness in his eyes."But nothing! You realize Filo is dead right?!", Caleb stated as Mirabelle and the rest are taken aback by it. Each of the Zyklons look away despondently with Drei closing her eyes in thought."Yes.", Sterling spoke in a low, melancholic tone, "We...We found her body...during the investivation.""You realize that so called Angel was the one who did it to her?! I watched! I watched helpless as that fucking bitch tortured and killed her!", Caleb says tears form thinking of her lifeless body on the floor. Mirabelle, Lyca, and Camilla stared wordlessly with anguished expressions."No, I didn't. Thank you for telling me and...i'm so, so sorry you had to experience that. I truly am.", Sterling speak in an almost forlorn tone, "I...sent a request contact her family."Caleb immediately feels worse now aware she had family. He inhales and exhales slowly, "You know...even though I want to blame myself for her death...what she said to me...before she died...I find it hard to do that now. She believed there was something in me, I still can't see, and maybe never will. But...she showed me it's there and I'd dishonor her memory if I didn't explore it.""Dear...", Mirabelle utter softly.Caleb caresses Mirabelle's face lovingly, "Moon pie, I love you, I know you know that. But yes, everything Filo said is true.", Caleb then turns to Camilla and Lyca, "Lyca. Camilla. I love you both as well. The truth is I went and fell in love with all of you. But, that doesn't mean I love any of you any less. You're all in my heart...and I won't leave a single one of you out."Each of the girls stare at him as tears of pure happiness stream down their cheeks. Caleb continues, "I decided...I will give this multiple spouse thing a try. If that's...ok with you girls."Sterling's eyes widen in surprise."Of course it is Dear!", Mirabelle exclaims happily staring lovingly with a heavy blush."Wait, really Moon pie?"Lyca suddenly pushes in on him her eyes filled with adoration and blushing heavily, "We talked it out and we're perfectly fine sharing you!""Si Senor!", Camilla stated lowering the gaurd rail before sitting on the bed. Her eyes filled with devotion and her heart doing somersaults in joy, "We all decided that we all love you for the same reasons and wanted to make it work."Caleb gives a surprised look before melting into a smile seeing all his girls around him. He then turns to Sterling, "Ok, Sterling, it's settled. The Bizzell house will be the first harem marriage trial."Sterling smiles happily before closing his eyes returning to a professional demeanor, "That you so much, Mr. Bizzell. I promise I'll help support you any way I can."Ein, Zwei, and Drei smile giving each other thumbs up followed by touching each of their scythes together three musketeers style.Suddenly, a thought occurred to Caleb."Oh, there's something else, I'd like to know. Mirabelle when... Nikolai attacked us...how did we escape?"Mirabelle pauses eyes widening as Ein and Camilla did the same. Each collectively thinking the same thing."Caleb... don't you remember what happened?", Mirabelle says finally.N-not...not really.", Caleb admitted rubbing his forehead, "I remember he hit you...then he pointed a gun at you...and then...nothing."Camilla and Mirabelle exchange plaintive looks before Ein approaches."Mr. Bizzell, I don't know what that was but-", she started but Camilla interrupts."BUT it does not matter for now, ju must rest and we can so the rest out later.", Camilla emphasizes the last point looking directly at Ein."Right.", Ein says relenting to the request. Mirabelle looks to Camilla feeling uncertain and she nods letting her know it's ok."Oh, I remember something else!", Caleb says getting their attention, "What happened to that girl? The one who was with Nikolai. She had these goat horns and hooves and she carried a big scythe. I think her name was uuhhh...I'm Fan-""Fantastic! Mr. Bizzell, you get some rest, keep up the good work, and I will see you again soon.", Sterling stated before hurrying out of the room. Ein quickly follows behind him."Um, good day, Mr...Bizzell?", A man who looks like a doctor walks in looking at his clipboard before looking up surprised at the managerie of liminal women in his room, "I am Dr. Underwood and I will be your physician for today.""Actually, you're services won't be necessary.", Drei says taking out a vials of green salve and a jar of orange balls of medicine that kinda look like him gumballs, "I'll be treating his wounds."Dr. Underwood gives a puzzled look, "Ma'am, I would not recommend or condone giving a patient non-governmentally regulated approved medicines. This patient has sustained severe damages to his nervous system that can effect motor skills and even sense of touch in general. He'll likely have to go through months of physical therapy. I don't think his insurance will cover much of it.""Uh huh, so apply this on literally any part of your body to relieve the soreness then eat one of these right now and another in the morning. You'll be fine to leave by tomorrow afternoon.", Drei says as Caleb thanks taking then rubbing a generous amount on his arms and chest. Mirabelle gives him one of the orange balls. It's a bit bitter but he eats it anyway.Dr. Underwood stood flabbergasted by her claim, "Excuse ma'am but I must alert security. You are performing illegal medical practices on hospital gr-"At that moment, Caleb stands up on the side of the bed to the doctor's shock."Whoa, my soreness is and I can stand agai-Ohhh whoa!", Caleb exclaims losing his balance but Camilla catches him from behind before helping him sit back on the bed, "Ah. Thank you hun.""Of course, mi amor.", Camilla says pecking his cheek."Guess I'm still gonna need time to heal.", Caleb says as Drei hops on the bed."Just relax and let the medicine do it's thing.", she says patting his back then hoping off the bed walking out the door past Underwood, "I'm hungry. You Zwei?""Sure, let's head to the cafeteria.", Zwei says walking behind her."Wait!", Underwood calls and they stop in their tracks, "How...How is that possible?"Drei turns her head, " It's because I heal because I can. Not because of some insurance plan." She continues walking."Zyklons.", Zwei whispers doing a head rocking pose before continuing with her sister. Underwood stands watching them, then looking to Caleb and his girl talking and giggling, as he contemplates his life....Sterling walked through the hall of the hospital. One thing reverberating in his mind. That being seeing...her again after all this time."Agent Sterling.", Ein saysHe turns to her, "Ah, Ms. Zyklon, what is it?""I need to talk to you about the...magic...goat liminal I fought against.", Ein stated"Baphomet. Her species is called the Baphomet and they're very powerful magic users at that, Ms. Zyklon.", Sterling answered walking the glass windows m and looking down below at the people walking around outside."I remember you said her name when you first saw her. Do you two know each other?", Ein inquired.Sterling turns to her with a serious look, "Ms. Zyklon, if I tell you this, you say a word to anyone. Even if Caleb brings it up! DO you understand?""Y-yes sir, I promise ", Ein says saluting him.He gestures her to at ease before turning to the window pensively, "I knew her a long time ago. Her name was Fantina, my old partner."WR:Sup fam! I hope you all had a Merry Christmas! Mine was pretty good, spent time with the folks, played around with nieces and nephews, I even got myself a new puppy for my birthday. Her name is Switzerland, she's a beagle, and I love her so very, very much. Now, gotta be honest, this chapter was supposed to go out Christmas DAY. I had a whole thing figured out where I post one on Christmas eve and another and Christmas day. Buuuut, while I was typing finishing things up, I slipped a key or whatever and accidentally deleted HALF THE GODDAMN CHAPTER! So...I spent the last couple days remedying that and may have actually restored things better than they were before. So I hope you enjoyed it. Make sure to fav, share, follow, post, and review.Alright now, see ya in 2020. PEACE FAM!
  
    Chapter Text
    Chapter 24: Choices"Y-You're partner?!", Ein stated in genuine shock.Sterling turns away from her looking out the window with his hands interlocked behind his back, "That's correct, Ms. Zyklon. In fact, she was one of the best agents we had in the U.S. branch. Top marks in all training courses and top in her class on the I.A. exam. I know because we were in the same training course; where we first met.""Really? That's one of the hardest exams in the organization! The ones that pass are qualified to lead entire districts!", Ein stated incredulously. She actually fought someone with those kinds of skills? No wonder she had such a rough time with her. She looks to Sterling, "So...what happened? Why is she working with the Malones?"Sterling exhales collecting his thoughts before turning to the wind weasel, "Ms. Zyklon, i'm going to tell you a story and I need you to promise you won't tell anyone. Not I.A., not Caleb, not even your sisters. Do you understand?"Ein pauses for moment before nodding, "Yes sir."Sterling looks her in the eye seeing she truly meant it. He composes himself and began, "It was... 9 years ago. Back when the Interspecies exchange program was trying to find its footing. When humans first learned that...they weren't the only intelligent beings on this planet. When, for a moment, most other world issues took a back seat to the news that creatures of fiction were completely real. Protests, violence, public fear was rampant among Americans, hell most of the world, with citizens who people like you as demons or, more colloquially, monsters. It was...a chaotic time to say the least. It didn't help that many non-human were not eager to start integration to begin with and many actively sought to put a stop to it. I was just beginning my career as an officially licensed agent after transferring from the bureau of investigation as a deputy detective in Virginia before being assigned here in Alabama At the time, ICEP needed as many experienced personnel as they could find to keep the peace and quell the fear mongering running throughout the Southern states. Fantina and I were among the newly appointed agents working to ensure the increase progression of liminal integration and dispel public fear. Our relationship was...rough in the beginning. Hell, first day she was assigned to me first thing I said "Where did this child come from and where's my partner?"...She took exception to that; and by 'exception' I mean she kicked me in the groin with her rockhard hoof."Ein recoils slightly as Sterling shook his head as nostalgia played in his mind. He continues, "Not the best way to start a relationship but we eventually found some common ground in our work. We weren't making very much back then so were a bit at odds with each other. We barely even said much to each other outside of work aside from briefing on our assignments. We were fairly successful in many of our assignments and I quickly learned she had her own unique yet...abrasive style in dealing with unruly humans and liminals. The two of us gained something of a reputation in MON as being the ONLY team consisting of just two members. We were even promoted to being the heads of the first Exchange office here in Huntsville. As more time passed, she gradually opened up to me more and more and we even did things together outside of work. She was such a free spirit. Always willing to do what needed to be done yet always following her own path. Fantina always had my back, even when things got too rough for either of us. I could tell she knew I would always be there for her no matter how complicated things got. Before I knew it we were practically inseparable. She was...an amazing girl. Very Proud, caring...and very passionate.", Sterling spoke fondly closing his eyes with memories playing and smiling warmly to himself."It sounds like you two were very close sir.", Ein says with a small grin.Sterling's shot open, a light blush on his cheek, realizing he got caught in reminiscing before clearing his throat, "Y-yes...we were.""Then...what happened? Why did she choose to work for the Malones", Ein inquires.Sterling's smile dissolve to a frown. He looks away pensively at the outdoor scenery of buildings, "When the U.S. was getting ready to pass the exchange bill allowing liminals to integrate into our country, there was...a heavy divide in what species would be allowed into the program. Many species other countries deemed too "dangerous" had to be excluded. At least, for the time being until the public gained better understanding of them to dissolve their fears and we found suitable hosts willing to take them in.""Oh yeah, I remember the Chinese government doing something very similar. They said it about keeping humans safe and liminals free from persecution...but...it just felt...", Ein trails"Like bullshit?", Sterling replies surprising Ein, "Like it felt like an excuse for the ones in charge of the could flex their power on other species? That most of the species allowed at the time were known produce profitable commodities and services?"Well I wouldn't say...that...but...", Ein spoke unsure of what to say."It's ok. Back then, that WAS the case, I could definitely see how biased we were. Arachne silk, weresheep wool, Scylla ink, anything considered valuable on the market produced by liminals the species were the, coincidentally, the first to be selected for the program. Then came the species excluded from the list. The ones considered to dangerous to be put into human...or even...a danger to our way of life.", Sterling stated."Your way of life? How? And what does this have to do with your partner?", Ein inquires"I'm getting to it. By that I mean species with...practices and belief systems that are frowned upon or considered immoral and reprehensible in American society. Species like vampires, who sustain themselves on human blood, Harpies, with their extreme sexual promiscuity, Orcs, with their proclivity towards violent and depraved acts, or...Baphomets, and their beliefs in...the depravity and sexual charm of little girls.", Sterling finished while rubbing the back of his head.Ein blinked in surprise, "Um...excuse me, sir?""Fantina's race is...very strong in their beliefs almost to a fanatic degree; Fantina was no different. They believed that not enough people appreciated the...charm and beauty of the...ahem "underdeveloped female form". They wanted all men and women to know this, espescially the former. Of course, this didn't bode well with the higher ups and immediately excluded her species from integrating for the time being. This enraged Fantina.", Sterling look down at the lower half of the building's roof covered brown stones then to the birds sitting along the edge, "The bill essentially discriminated against her and her people for her beliefs...even her appearance."Ein slowly shakes her head in disbelief, "W-what happened to her after that? Did that make her leave?"Sterling frown looking away somberly, "No, that crushed her, but drove her away from ICEP altogether...was me.""Y-you, sir?", Ein inquires in shock."Before this section of the Bill could be passed, it needed, not only the folks in Congress approval, but the popular vote of each highly established exchange branch office head in each state. If a branch refused to cast a vote, the office shut down indefinitely and all liminal students would have lost their temporary citizenship. I along with Fantina were in charge of this state's branch office. Naturally, Fantina wanted to vote against but, unfortunately, at the time liminal MON agents did not enjoy the same judicial rights as humans and did not have the right to vote; which angered her even more. So...it fell to me. After meditating on it for some time...and I...I voted...yes.", Sterling admitted wistfully touching his palm to the glass."You...you...approved it. Sir?", Ein said in a dispirited tone as her ear slightly drooped downwards."...Yeah, I did. Though...if I didn't, the liminals living in this state at the time, who had settled here as their new home, who wanted nothing more than to be able build lives and be looked at as anything but...freaks...to have those dreams taken away! I did my part to make this country open to people any race or species. I did what was right for everyone! ...That's what I told myself before...Fantina confronted me. She found out what I did and...", Sterling trails.Flashback"How? How could you?!", a slightly younger Fantina stood in front of a slightly younger Sterling with a look of both anger and hurt on her face. The two were in the first modeled lobby of Alabama's first Exchange office."Fan...Fan I had to. If I didn't EVERY other liminal student in this state would have lost their temporary licensure and would have been deported! I couldn't let that happen! They all deserve a chance to be of society and to not have hide in the shadows!", Sterling protested earning a tense look from the Baphomet."A chance huh? Yeah, yeah I'm sure it's easy giving a chance to the liminals you ARBITRARILY PICK AS YOUR FAVORITES. Do you realize that more than half of the species on that list are the ones with most HUMANOID appearance. Meanwhile, the ones they decided aren't good enough or too dangerous or too different are the ones who ridiculed and abused because refuses to acknowledge them. People...like me...who, just of because of our appearance, our way of life, we're to be avoided and isolated from so-called 'welcoming' society!""Fan, it's not like that at all. The bill is still in its infancy and many of the excluded species are still being observed in their interaction in human society. As soon as we understand them better, they will be let into the program. I promise.", Sterling says approaching her with a comforting gesture only for her to back away."AND HOW LONG WILL THAT TAKE?! Months? YEARS?! You expect me to wait on a hollowed out promise from the people who don't want me here anymore to begin with?! Don't you understand...they got all they wanted out of me. I'm going to be deported soon and that'll be the end of it.", Fantina finished shoulders drooping in a dispirited voice.Sterling kneels down on one knee in front of her, "Fan, listen to me, you are not going anywhere. You are a MON agent and damn incredible one at that! You aren't going anywhere, not if I have anything to say about it!", Sterling stated reaching to cup the side of her face only for her to roughly slap his hand away and backs away glaring at him."You've said PLENTY already with your decision! I TRUSTED YOU! YOU WERE MY FRIEND! You cared for me and you never intentionally treated me like a child or some freak! Do you realize how difficult it is for me? Everywhere we go, I feel the scornful eyes on the two of us together; like it's something unclean and disgusting!", Fantina gives a choked whimper at the end as her body trembled while clenching her fists.Sterling shakes his head slowly with sorrowful expression, "Fantina I...I'm sorry...I just...", he stands to his feet shakily reaching out to her."DON'T TOUCH ME! I was wrong about you!", Fantina shouted hysterically tears filling her eyes and running down her cheeks, "You're just like everyone else! Deep down I knew it but I just saw how nice and patient you were and you accepted me for who I was! You listened to me and I just wanted that for so long. You were everything I wanted! I...I...L-L...", Fantina pauses looking into his blue expectant eyes as she chokes on her words realizing saying them now is pointless. She quietly backs away with a despairing look as tears continued to flow down her cheeks. She turns and runs to the front entrance sobbing. Sterling takes of after her."FANTINA, WAIT!", He call for her as she expands her scythe to its full size then slicing the door door down leaving it a pile of broken glass."STAY AWAY! I'M DONE WITH ICEP AND I NEVER WANNA SEE YOU AGAIN!", she shouts back taking out her MON badge and tossing it to the ground. She raises her scythe and slices a rippling blue portal. Sterling maneuvers over the broken glass shards watching panic as the portal expands. She steps through not even turning to look at Sterling."No! Fantina, wait, please wait! I'M sorry!", Sterling runs to the portal as fast as he can reaching out desperately to follow his partner. It immediately closes before his fingers could make contact. He freezes for moment before noticing her badge on the ground. He squats down and with a shaky hand picks it up clutching it fervently. The realization that his partner was gone slowly dawning on him. He slowly drops his arm to his side as he stood up slowly. His eyes welling up with tears as his throat tightened trying to hold in a sob, "I'm...sorry.", He spoke softly as her gripped her badge tightly.Flashback endEin stood speechless. Many thoughts flowing through her mind after hearing that story and overwhelmed her so much she had to sit down in one of the adjacent waiting chairs."I never saw her again after that day. I tried to find her even having I.A. attempt to locate her but they never found any leads; she just went completely off the radar.", Sterling spoke wistfully. Ein looked at him with saddened eyes. He noticed before turning away and gripping the back of one of the leaning down with his head low then sighs, "Ms. Zyklon, have you noticed that unlike ICEP agents, I don't have a MON team?"Ein looks up with an inquisitive expression. Admittedly, the question had crossed her mind before but never inquired further on the subject."After...I lost Fantina I just...didn't have it in me to be a leader of new recruits.", Sterling reaches into his suit pocket pulling out a badge. The leather stitching was slightly worn but the metallic seem to have been well-maintained.Ein stated curiously, "What is that?"" It's her badge; the only part of her that still with me. I only have one partner...and I traded her away so that the bill could be put in place. I choose to work alone because...I didn't want to replace her because she is irreplaceable. That might sound stupid and corny, I know. Especially when we need more functioning teams more than ever.", Sterling stated rubbing his forehead."N-No! Sir I...I completely understand.", Ein spoke up, "You did what had to be done for the liminals in this state and the country. It's not either of your fault. You were both given a difficult choice to make and...it had to be made."Sterling was silent for a moment as he put the badge away, "I know and that part I don't regret. I...just wish things with the Bill could've been different then. And Fantina was right, it's been years since that day and these damn folks in the Senate still haven't appealed the section excluding Baphomet from the program.", Sterling grimaced gripping the arm of the chair. He then notices Ein staring at him with a worried look. He inhales and exhales before turning to her, "Ahem, I'm sorry for dumping my baggage on you like that.""It's ok Sir, really and...I want you to know I'm so sorry about what happened to you two. But, the question on my mind is...what now? She's back...and you both on opposing sides. I-I MEAN we don't know the circumstances that led her to working for them! Maybe she's afraid for her life! Maybe she's not truly siding with them, they could be blackmailing her! Or even-""MS. ZYKLON!", Sterling interrupted her rambling making Ein jump and go quiet, "I get it. For now, we know the Malones have a powerful magic based liminal in their service which makes keeping an eye on mr. Nikolai one of our top priorities. As for Fantina, we'll be keeping a closer watch for her. I suggest you do your part and watch out for Mr. Bizzell.""Y-Yes sir, of course.", Ein says in a respectful tone."Good. Now go check on your sisters, make sure you each keep an eye out for any strange activity. I need to make a call to the office.", Sterling says standing up then taking out his phone."Yes sir, but...are you-""I'm fine Ms. Zyklon now go do your job.", Sterling interrupts her walking to the window with his back turned. Ein silently raises from her seat."Yes sir.", she says giving a respectful bow before leaving.Sterling looks over his shoulder ensuring she was gone. He takes his phone and opens a personal file on his phone. He taps photos and opens one of them. The screen shows a photo from 8 years ago. In it, he and Fantina were sitting with a water fountain in the background. The latter comfortably sat in his lap looking up at him while cradling his chin in one of her paws. Sterling grips his chest lightly at Fantina's badge in his suit pocket. He closes his eyes as her words, 'I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN', rang through his head along with the memory of seeing her in the parking garage.'Fan...what are you doing?', he thought morosely.Ein walks through to the elevators. Her eyes glance down the hall where there were some rooms a few doors down from one of the nurse reception desk. There was one gaurded by two stern looking ICEP agents in yellow padded armor; one a burly human man the other and even more burly gargoyle man. She decides things on that end were fine and continues on to find her sisters. As she leaves, a third figure appears from out of one of the elevators. They were tall, wearing a black business suit, and necklength blonde hair with their elongated ear poking through. They approached the reception desk with the nurse eyes widening for a moment at their appearance. Likely her first time seeing an elf in person."H-Hello? How may I help you?", she spoke in a careful tone."Good evening miss, I am Detective Greenly of the state Bureau of investigation .", The elven man presents his badge to her, "I understand that you recently taken in a notorious criminal in your care by the name, Nikolai ivankov? I've been sent by to question him.""I'm...sorry sir but the patient is in no condition to answer any questions. He's sustained heavy injuries to put a comatose state. He nearly went into shock before bringing him in. Only hospital staff can enter and leave the room at this time.", The nurse replies. Greenly wears a cold look slowly accepting that his mission would be put on hold. However, there was something he COULD do to make sure his goal was accomplished."Hmm, I'm guessing that's where he's being kept.", Greenly says looking at the two MON guards before walking over to them. The nurse attempts to call him back, only getting out a few low utterances before getting from her chair. Greenly approaches the two MON guards who eye him suspiciously."Detective Greenly, Alabama Bureau of Investigation, please step aside gentleman.", Greenly stated presenting his badge. The two agents exchanged confused look before reluctantly doing as asked. The nurse approaches with a slightly frazzled expression."Sir, only hospital staff are permitted to enter! They are in a very compromised state!", The nurse stated trying to make him understand."So you've said. However, you don't fully understand who the person is you have under your care and the influence they have in certain areas...and even species. I'm just making sure that your patient doesn't recieved any surprise visitors.", Greenly stated before biting his index finger drawing a little blood before making a circle pattern with his hand. A turquoise magic seal appeared on the door as he began chanting something in an archaic language. He stops then places a bloody fingerprint on the door as the seal disperses covering the door. The nurse and the MON agents stand bewildered as the elf man cleans his finger with some tissue in his pocket, "I just but a seal on his room that cancels out all mystic arts in or outside it's range. It a limited range and it requires a small but of my own life energy to do it but it's worth it in circumstances like these Don't worry about entering, it has no affect on non-users of mystic arts.""U-um...ok but what about your assignment?", The nurse inquires not understanding a word of what he said."I'll leave my contact information with one of the other receptionists to let me know when he is awake and coherent enough for an interview ", Greenly says as he leaves them. The MON guards exchanged glances before returnings to their post. The nurse attempts to follow him but finds no sign of him. She reluctantly returns to her station.Inside, Nikolai lay in bed comatose. The entirery of his upper body, right leg, and even a third of his face were completely bandaged from the severe burns he recieved. A breath apparatus covered his mouth as the sound of the flowing air was accompanied by the beeping heart monitor. There was a window adjacent from his bed with the blinds halfway up which the nurse careless forgot to put down. Outside, a small figure could be seen peering inside. These sat on the lining of the building , their small frame and goat hooves making the rather easy, was Fantina with a remorseful look. She crouched down touching carefully touching the glass with her paw. It shocks her hands. Given her current elevation, she resists the urge to flinch before seeing the green veil of energy appear on the glass and disperse around the entire room."Tch, crafty sons of bitches. Bad enough this area is crawling with Mon agent now the one who put that barrier up for Jakob is here too?", Fantina curses before looking at Nikolai and the state he was in, "Then again, I guess it wouldn't have mattered either way. Sorry Nikolai, you're gonna have to hold on out here for awhile. Sigh, damn that idiot Angel!", Fantina finishes pounding the wall with her first cracking the concrete a little. Her thoughts played back the events of everything today trying to understand where it all went South( no pun intended). Her thoughts linger on the image of a Mon agent, one very familiar to her. Sterling. Her old partner. How long has it been? 6? 7 years? It feels longer yet he still looks the same. Like...nothing has changed.Fantina shakes this thought out of her head. 'No! EVERYTHING has changed, including him! He made his choice. He didn't want me...so I found my own way. I'm not giving up on my dream no matter what I have to do. Hmmm, in the meantime, as much as I hate it, I have to tell her...everything."Fantina then notices something flying in the distance slightly obscured by light of the setting sun. It appeared to be two liminal MON agents; one a hornet man the other a female Raven harpy."Dammit. They're patrols. Guess that's my cue to skidaddle. See ya later Nikolai.", she say before quickly dashing to edge of the building and brandishing her scythe. She leaps off the edge and slices a portal leaping through before disappearing in a glitter of red.*****Meanwhile in Caleb's room*****"Oh, Señora Mira? I've been meaning ask ju something.", Camilla says in a curious tone.Mirabelle turns to her, "Yes, what would that be?""What happened before ju teleported me and la comadreja ( weasel)? Ju seemed...out of control.", Camilla stated as Caleb turned to Mirabelle with an curious expression unsure of what happened while he was held captive."Yeah...I mean you were kinda losing it there. I was really worried and THEN you and Cami just disappear out of nowhere?! Me and the old man were freaking out until Zwei calmed me down.", Lyca added with a worried look on her face."I-I'm sorry for worrying you all.", Mirabelle spoke solemnly, "I...honestly don't know what came over. Suddenly I felt this...surge of emotions and...I could hear Dear's voice echo through my head! The only thing I wanted to do at that moment...was go to you.", she spoke looking at Caleb with utter devotion in her eyes. Caleb couldn't help smiling warmly at her before cupping the side of her face."I get what you mean. After...seeing Filo die like that...I felt something boil over inside me...Then I just felt really exhausted. Then again I WAS tortured for 2 hours straight so...", Caleb replied.Mirabelle nods intently understanding him, "It's strange. That's the furthest I've ever teleported before and it was somewhere I've never been before.""Is teleporting like a big thing with magic users?", Caleb inquired."Not really. It is one of those spells that is easy to learn but difficult to properly control and master. I can use a similar form but it tends to drain a lot of my energy quickly; not to mention I feel nauseous afterwards. That being said, I believe that whatever happened, it is fortunate ju were able to find Señor in time Senora Mirabelle .", Camilla stated with a proud grin."I-It was just a fluke though! Besides...you and Ms. Ein did most of the real fighting. I can only use support and defense based magic so the best I could do was be a shield.", Mirabelle spoke lowly obviously feeling insecure.*poke* Caleb taps her forehead, "Go away bad thoughts.""Ah, Dear?", Mirabelle exclaims holding the spot her touched."I'd say you did more than enough. I'd be filled with holes if it weren't for you, Moon pie.", Caleb says gently squeezing her hand, "You saved me...again.""He is right Señora. Ju were great, do not sell yourself short. Your mana is quite strong, I could sense it. Ju played a bigger role than me or the tall rodent girl.", Camilla added giving a supportive grin.Mirabelle pauses a moment looking up to her with thankful expression, "Thank you...I guess I still have my habits. But you were brilliant as well Camilla, you gave that Angel a proper thrasher.""Awwww, now I really wish I could've been there too! I would've beat the crap out of her! She needed to pay for how she treated treated all of us!", Lyca growled brandishing her claws in front of her face."Do not worry Señora Lyca, she will not bother us...ever again.", Camilla's last word were laced with obvious venom that prompted a curious look from Caleb and Lyca then a perturbed look from Mirabelle."Uhhh...Camilla...what do you mean by-", Caleb stated before being the door of the room flies open."Nephew!", called a familiar gruff voice. Mirabelle visibly jumps as she, along with Caleb and the others turned to see Caleb's uncle standing in the doorway. He wore black dress pants with matching shined dress shoes, pressed clean buttoned up suit jacket, and black fedora with white band around it. Underneath the jacket, he wore a white collar shirt with black floral silver pattern necktie. They notice one of the nurses stood behind him and he politely thanks her for escorting him before she leaves."Uncle Junior?", Caleb stated as his mouth partially hung open in surprise, "W-What are you doing here?""Me? Boy, that should be asking YOU! I go by yo house seeing if you and your girls wanted to come to tonight's Revival down by Morning Star, and I see all these police and ICEP folks parked around yo street and none of y'all are nowhere! I try to see what going they talking all around the monkey's ass so I don't what's going on. THEN I get a call saying you in the HOSPITAL!", The old man scolded in an irate tone before giving a sigh looking to his nephew with genuine worry seeing the bandages on his arms. His tone shifts to a softer, more concerned one , "What happened nephew?"Caleb is silent first as Mirabelle and Lyca look to Junior with appreciation that he came to see about their host yet also felt a bit guilty for making his only nearby relative worry so much. Camilla stated silent eying the man cautiously trying to get a good read on him."I-I'm fine, Uncle Junior. Really I am, I just ran into a little bit of trouble is all.", Caleb explained not wanting his uncle to know the full story just yet.His uncle approaches his bed. Camilla narrows her eyes suspiciously but then Lyca lightly taps her hand getting her attention before whispering about what a good man his uncle is. Camilla reluctantly backs down. Mirabelle shifts over to the side allowing his uncle to stand beside the bed right next to Caleb."Even a little bit is too much.", Junior laying a hand a Caleb shoulder, "Tell the truth now, what happened? I can't help until you tell me."Caleb looks up at him before looking towards the bedsheets in thought, "Its...actually a long story...but...I guess the gist of it is...uhh...""He was attacked by an Angel! An...evil Angel who was...working with the Malones.", Mirabelle surprising Caleb as he looked to her wantingly."A what? Evil Angel?", Junior stated in definite shock pausing to meditate on it."Yes, there...are bad Angels out there Uncle. I was unlucky enough to catch the attention of one. Honestly, I'd be dead right now if it weren't for Mirabelle and Camilla.", Caleb replies gesturing to them both.Junior eyes widen a bit having JUST NOW noticed Camilla. The Demoness crosses her arms staring at him coldly expecting the typical upon seeing her."Huh...you must be the new girl this boy done took in.", Junior says before extending a hand to her, "Nice to finally meet you ma'am."Camilla is slightly taken aback before reaching up and shaking the man's hand, "Hola, ju may call me Ms. Sartana", she uttered"Well, Ms. Sartana, thank you so much for saving my nephew...for the second time now huh?""I suppose so.", Camilla responded"Heh, never thought I'd be shaking the Devil's hand but here I am. But...you do seem like a nice lady.", he says releasing her hand giving her an accepting smile. Camilla goes silent studying the man before he continues, "And you too babygirl! Guess this makes two-for-two for you too, ehehehehe!", He chuckles patting Mirabelle on the back."Oh! O-of course sir! I would never let anything bad happen to Dear!", Mirabelle says giving a shy grin collecting herself a bit."mmmrrgrrgrrr. I wish I could've gotten there too! But Sterling wouldn't let me through to follow chiefs scent. I could've taken that Angel AND those bastards!", Lyca stated bounding up to Junior."You would've beat they asses huh?", Junior chuckles."Damn right! AND do it without pants!", Lyca stated puffing out her chest."Pahahahahaha! Haa never change Lyca Darlin'.", Junior says patting the she-wolf on the head as said wolf mewled blissfully at the attention. Caleb and Mirabelle chuckled as well while Camilla gave a slightly reserved grin."Thanks Uncle Junior, for coming to see about me. And...sorry for worrying you.", Caleb says in a low voice"Boy, now what I tell you about saying stupid stuff like that? You my nephew! The only one that I can talk to who don't got his head to far up his ass too far up his as at least. And don't tell me not to worry, I'll be worrying about you when nobody else is.", Junior replies.Caleb gives a small grin, "Yeah...I know, I guess wanted to hear it.""I tell ya truth you got everyone one of her ways. Little bean head nigga.", Junior chuckles playfully rustling Caleb head as the latter playfully wrestled away. Mirabelle and Lyca pause for a second after hearing him say the 'N' word. Caleb taught them it was a terrible thing to call member of his ethnic group...but also that it was fine if HE or another person in his group said it. A functional double standard."Y'all, don't he got a bean head?!", Junior heartily chuckles gesturing around the top of Caleb's head. The girls looks at Caleb tilting their heads."Who you calling bean head?!", Caleb stated in annoyance. Each of the girls eyes widen in realization before the sound of snickers and snorting trying to hold in the giggles filled the."Ohohohohoh I see! It is like Le poroto ( Kidney bean)!", Camilla laughed."Hahaha how have I never noticed before?!", Mirabelle chuckled into her hand.Lyca goes over to Caleb and wraps her furry arms around him resting her head on top of his before proceeding to blissfully giggle while cuddling him."Lyca...honey...what are you doing?", Caleb asked plainly as the She-wolf continued caressing him."Hugging my bean head Alpha! Your head's the perfect shape for cuddles!", Lyca says pressing her cheeks to his."That I can't deny, Lyca.", Mirabelle added before going over to cuddle him as well."You guys have terrible bedside manner.", Caleb spoke defeated his voice muffled running Lyca rubbing against his cheek. Camilla chortles at the sight biting her lip slightly wanting to join in on the action."I quit yo huffin' and puffin' nephew. You should be glad some pretty girls wanna hug up on you. Hehehehehe Vanessa would love to see how far you come.", Junior chuckled.Camilla turns to him eyebrow, "Va...nessa?""Ergh, she's my cousin and his daughter. How is she by the way? She gone back up state?", Caleb inquired after prying himself out of their comforting grips."Man, that child left a few days THEN had to turn around come back because she forgot her suitcase with her clothes.", Junior says shaking his head, "God help that girl.""Still as absent minded as ever huh?", Caleb replies with a light chuckle."Yeahhhh.", He drones in a long sigh, "So how long the doctor you gotta stay for?""Well the doctor said I'd have nerve damage that'd take weeks of rehabilitation buuut Drei gave me some of her medicine so I should be ready to leave by tomorrow. In fact, it seems to be working cuz my muscles don't feel so numb anymore.", Caleb explained."Whoa, now whole up! ...Now who is 'Drei'? Is she another girl you got staying with you?", Junior stated."No...she's one of my bodyguards.", Caleb says reluctantly."ONE of?", Junior stated incredulously."Yeah...there's also her sisters Zwei and Ein Zyklon. They're MON agents from China assigned as my personal bodyguards. Also, they're weasels...with...wind powers? You should meet them they're...yeah.", Caleb grins sheepishly realizing how far our of the loop he left his uncle.Junior glares at him with a stern expression, "Boy you better explain yourself right now before I put a knot upside yo head."****meanwhile****The hospital was a bit lively with several people both visitor and staff going about their business. Drei sat at one of the tables eating they're food. Drei was scrolling her phone as Zwei picked apart her fish."Ugh, this fish is terrible. It's like if somebody took a bunch of old fish parts and smushed them into one crap patty.", Zwei says sticking out her tongue in disgust."That's called the food industry. Also, I just saw you eat a meatball you dropped on the floor like 10 minutes ago. Why are you complaining?", Drei stated."Hey I have a very delicate pallete. Only but the best can enter this temple.", Zwei whimsically replies while making circles around her tummy."I think I faintly heard the sound of Gordan Ramsay's forehead vein bursting.", Dre replied before taking out a small metal flask then taking a swig.Zwei looks up in anticipation, "I-Is that what I think it is?""Yep, my special rice wine blend. I brewed a batch a couple days ago.", Dre says taking another sip, "It's been a long day.""Hey can't deny that. Give me some.", Zwei replies Drei takes out a second flask handing it to her. Zwei drinks a couple gulps, " Haaahhh, yeah that's what I'm talkin about!"Suddenly, they're approached by a tall man in casual business attire and shy smile, "Uh, excuse me but aren't you ladies a bit young to be drinking?Zwei and Drei give the man an annoyed and dismissive look."Aren't you a little old to be wearing candy cane suspenders?", Drei stated and the man's smile vanished, "Now beat it, school buses don't run this late.""Yeah, get lost dipshit, you're killing my vibe.", Zwei added, "Go find a lower hanging fruit or just stand in a mirror naked.""W-What no i-its not like that! I was just...making sure you ladies aren't underaged so-""Dude if you don't leave right now we're yelling 'child molester' to the top of our lungs." , Zwei warned."Wait listen I was only-", the man uttered stepping closer to their table"CHILD MOLES-", the two scream before the man backs off then quickly walks away swearing under his breathe. Zwei and Drei fistbump each other."There you guys are! Haaa you could've at least texted where you were.", said Ein walking towards them."You would've gotten hungry eventually. It made sense to wait here.", Drei commented."Yeah, whatever.", Ein says getting a chair from an empty table then down joining her sisters. She then notices Drei holding a flask, "Oh good is that some of your special rice wine? Let me have some of that."Zwei and Drei pause in surprise before Drei hands her a third flask. Ein takes it and immediately downs the entire thing only stopping to gasp for air."Have any more?", Ein ask her cheeks becoming rosy."Whoa! Somebody's trying to get buzzed. Usually you're scolding us for drinking while on duty. What got you all rattled?", Zwei inquired.Ein pauses remembering her promise, "I-I'm sorry guys. I-I can't tell you.", Ein says in a sorrowful tone."Ahh, come on sis. It can't be that bad. What did you and Agent Sterling talk about while you were gone. You can tell me I'm a great at keeping-", Zwei stops noticing Ein raising an eyebrow give an expression that said 'really? Come on'."Well...most secrets. Come on, we're a trio, we share just about everything. Money, food, clothes, vibrators, even the same heat cycle.", Zwei stated nonchalantlyEin sighs, "As unsettlingly true that is, I...can't this time. It's an order.""What kind of order is that?! So Drei and I are left out of the loop while you have to bare that alone?! This is-", Zwei was interupted"Zwei! Enough!", Drei stated as Zwei pauses, "It's not our business for now. I'm sure Sterling will tell us too eventually. For now, let's just respect Ein's privacy."Drei the sets a plate of gravy meatballs and grilled chicken in front of Ein, "You're gonna need some dinner for your dinner."Ein grins sweetly, "Thank you Drei."Drei takes her seat as Zwei grumbles before stuffing her face with meatballs."Just be careful, ICEP's policies on fraternization is just as strict over here as they are back home.", Drei stated taking a sip of her flask. Zwei freezes her mouth stuffed with meat as meatball falls out of her fingers. Ein chocked on her chicken."Hnnngg *cough cough* Ack WHAT?! IM NOT TRYING TO SLEEP WITH HIM!", Ein shouted shooting up from her seat. The other people in the cafeteria stop what they're doing and turn the Zyklon's table. Ein's angry glare softens as she notices all the eyes on her the turns several shades of red in embarassment."Hahaha haaa, sorry...we were just...rehearsing lines. Guess I got too into the parrrt, haha. Sorry.", Ein giggles slowly shrinking down into her seat as the civilian resumed their own thing. Ein buries her head in her arms as wanting to disappear."Ahem...you know...there are better ways to get a raise but that is a good backup", Zwei spoke.Ein pokes her head up bearing her fangs making angry weasel growls....WRSup Fam! Back again! Happy 2020! The year of the Rat, MY year baby! Sorry if this chapter took so long been busy with classes got my first Mechanical design project coming up next week.

    Chapter Text
    Chapter 23: Time to Date. Time to GrowMore than a week passed after the incident. The news media had a field day with not only the eye witness reports of the mayhem that transpired within the top floor of the parking garage. Although, many of these witness reports were from a grounded perspective and the police and Mon units prevented any civilians from breaching the perimeter. However, one thing most of them proclaimed as fact was what the tabloids coined a "Miracle from Heaven". During the chaos, a large explosion accompanied by a bright golden flash erupted from the top of the parking garage sending lots of debris falling below; luckily, no one was seriously injured. The people below then witnessed an Angel emerge from the golden light before suddenly crashing into the top of church. Seconds later, hundred dollar bills started raining down below which whipped the crowd into a frenzy grabbing the falling cash. The body of the Angel was found on church grounds, with it's wings severed, dead impaled in the throat by a large iron cross. Most of the money was seized by the police with forty percent being donated to the church for repairs and social service assistance which benefits poorer community members and allowed the church to pay it's outstanding debts. Soon, the grisly scene of the mutilated Angel was seen by some as a sign of heaven sacrificing one of it's Angels for the children below. Yay?Even more good came out of these events when the magic imbued weapons, collars and ammunition confiscated by the police and used to locate other smugglers using them thanks to help from ICEP magic users. Azaeli's death also meant criminals like the Malones no longer had access to these exceedingly dangerous tools thus leveling the playing field in taking down smugglers.The detainment of one of the Malone family's prominent members accompanied by the execution of another the same day, ICEP's PR in Alabama was now under greater scrutiny in the public eye. Roughly half of the state believing they and the B.I.( Bureau of Investigation) were truly doing what was best for the human and liminal kind. The other half saw them doing much more harm than good for the people of the state. What's more, this, along with the recent amendment to the exchange that prohibited interspecies marriage resulted in a series of ongoing protest and riots throughout, not only Alabama, but much of the Southern states and parts of the Northwest. Many humans and liminals rallied to together in the streets, taking over social media and the news to voice their favor of the law with what now being called the 'I-Do Movement'. Since then, there were quite a few cases of hate-motivated crimes against liminal families by humans and by a certain group of liminal extremists became more prevalent in the news and putting ICEP on higher alert than ever before.In the midst of the chaos, the Bizzell household was, once again, returning to some shreds of normalcy. Caleb was able to leave the hospital much sooner than anticipated baffling the hospital staff. Knowing he didn't want to draw any more unwanted media attention, Sterling and ICEP did their best to hide Caleb's and his house guests involvement in the incident. Caleb told his uncle everything from him and Mirabelle being in a relationship now to the harem marriage plan. At first, he expressed discontent towards the idea but the girls made it exceedingly clear of their feelings towards his nephew and Caleb voiced his desire to at least try and make it work. Despite his reservations, Uncle Andrew knew they were all being sincere and decided to just be supportive of his nephew's choice. He promised not to tell anyone, not even his daughter of Nathan's true relationship with his girls; under the condition he could say Mirabelle and Caleb were a couple and win the bet he made with his daughter. Eventually, Caleb and the girls were able to go bacl home and get back to their lives. Despite some noticeable, NOTICEABLE changes....Thursday morning...The alarm sounds on Caleb's phone signalling the start of a new day. He groggily reaches for the snooze button but fumbles around the nightstand for the annoying device."Nnnrrrgghh!", Caleb groans knock something down that wasn't the phone.Suddenly, the alarm is silenced."Morning Dear.", hummed a familiar sweet British voice.Caleb raises his head, eye fluttering open to see the smiling face of his girlfriend kneeling right beside his bed. He smiles back at her."Good morning Moon pie.", Caleb replies turning his body placing his arms behind his head, "Still watching me sleep through the night huh?""You make it sound I'm a creeper or something.", Mirabelle huffed."Well you're the cutest little creep I ever saw.", Caleb joked."Haha, very funny you cheeky little wanker.", Mirabelle replied snarkily before Caleb raised up in bed allowing the cover to slide down his bare, shirtless chest. Mirabelle's eyes are immediately drawn to the hoof mark on his chest. Not only was it now darker than his own skin but there were now strange flame-like wispy patterns circular around the hoof shape. She recognized the pattern as she had once seen an image of it in her tribe but she couldn't remember where."You know, it's not nice to stare. You'll strain your eyes and give the other person a complex.", Caleb stated in a dismissive tone. Suddenly, Mirabelle touches her hand to his chest with a forlorn look."I'm sorry...I just...I want to make sure you're ok; that nothing bad is happening to you because of me.", Mirabelle spoke softly.Caleb remained silent understanding what she meant. After returning home, the girls told him about his strange 'transformation' during the fight with that Malone. Of course, he didn't remember anything and thought they were exaggerating until he noticed the hoof mark had changed into what it is now. Then there earlier this week he spent two straight days completing a design project for work with no sleep AT ALL. He wasn't fatigued. He didn't want to freak out or freak out the girls so tried to downplay it. College students can do that no problem.Caleb caresses her cheek, "Moon pie, nothing, nothing is your fault, ok?""Yes...", Mirabelle uttered tracing his chest then looking up at him, "You had that dream again."Caleb goes quiet remembering the dream last night. The feeling of helplessness, terrible pain, the Malones, the Angel, Filo dead body, along with Mirabelle and the girls, all dead. Caleb sighs lightly, "Yeah...""I did my best to keep you relaxed in the dreamscape. I could feel...all your pain. ", Mirabelle spoke solemnly, "I can feel you've changed in there too. I don't know how to describe it. You just...feel different."Caleb moves closer then puts his hand behind her head forcing her closer as he lock eyes with her, "Thanks, I appreciate you caring so much. And don't worry, whatever other changes happen...no that this won't.", Caleb finishes placing a kiss on her lips to which she reciprocates wholeheartedly. They touch foreheads as they stare at each other smiling."Ok, time to get dressed, today's a big day", He says releasing her head as she backs up to give him room. He yanks the sheets off his lap."OH!", Mirabelle gasps eyes widening covering her mouth."What? What is-", Caleb pauses when he notices what her eyes were fixated on; the tent he was pitching in his pajama bottoms. He gulps seeing her lick her lips hungrily."~Well you're feeling randy(British term for "horny") this morning~. Did I stir a flame in your dangly bits?", Mirabelle giggles nibbling her fingertip hungrily."I...love it when you try to talk dirty but I really need to get dressed right-whoa!", Caled said standing up only for the aroused Centaur to suddenly teleport in front of him pushing him to sit back down."What's the rush Dear? The morning is still young. ~Certainly enough time for a quickie~", Mirabelle spoke in a lustful tone before mushing her breasts into his chest attempting to coerce him. She grins lasciviously at his adoring groans as she begins stroking him through his pajamas. He caresses her back drifting down the hem of her light blue pajamas top then putting fingers underneath to trace her tender skin then gliding up her side. She gets goosebumps at his touch kisses his pectoral muscles before raising up and proceeding to unbutton her and top revealing the purple linen bra barely containing her ample breasts."Heh, clearly you're eating well.", Caleb remark with a smirk.Mirabelle slaps his chest puffing her cheeks, "Your fault. I've grown a size because of your cooking. I might just stop wearing a bra at all if I get any bigger. In fact, this is a bit snug.", Mirabelle smirks positioning over his erection and proceeds to unhook herself from the front. Caleb mouth goes dry as he awaits the morning sun to be freed when..."MORNING CHIEF!", howled Lyca her bursts into the room."GAH!", "GAH!", Caleb and Mirabelle shriek tensing up in surprise."OH right, sorry, forgot", Lyca says before knocking the door, "You ready for today chie-", Lyca pauses noticing Mirabelle, who was frantically button her pajama up again. Caleb stealthily covers his lap with a pillow."Huh, Mira? What are you doing in Cheif den?""I-I was...um...asking for...for...", Mirabelle trails."For grits!", Caleb finished as Mirabelle raised an eyebrow, "She...asked if I'd make her some Southern style grits with toast for breakfast. Yeah."Lyca tilted her head as they smiled awkwardly at her. She smiles back and says, "Ok, sounds tasty. Can I have some with bacon and steak Chief?!""Uhh, yeah! Sure thing Lyca.", Caleb replies, "Let me get dressed and I'll be out in a minute.""Ok! Thanks and I'm really excited for our date today Chief!", Lyca replies tail wagging happily before turning to leave.Mirabelle and Caleb breath a sigh after holding their breath. Suddenly..."Oh, you guys can finish if you want.", Lyca added making the two flinch upon being caught. Lyca notices their confused looks, "You guys were mating right? The scent is all in the room."Mirabelle and Caleb fumbled their words in response."It's fine, I'll just go get ready while you finish!", Lyca stated before going back to her room.Mirabelle and Caleb exchange looks before sighing in defeat."You gotta love her.", Caleb shrugs" I do, but her timing is quite the dickens.", Mirabelle replied."Alright, let's get dressed for real now. I've got things to do today and so do you and Camilla.", Caleb says getting up and walking to his dresser."You're right, we did agree on it. However, I will be back for that sweet arse later.", Mirabelle winks seductively before teleporting out of his room. Caleb smirks shaking his head."Wonder why she started doing that more lately.", Caleb inquired to himself.He reminisces on the events that led to this outing with Lyca....flashback...2 Days Earlier"Dates?", Caleb inquired as Camilla, Mirabelle, and Lyca wore surprised looks."What better way for you to really understand each of them than with one-on-one time with them?", Zwei questioned."It might not necessarily translate for you, but our father did something similar with our mothers. It helped make things feel less strange at least.", Ein added."Think of a 90s romcom where the guy asks three girls out at the same time except all the girls KNOW he asked them out and encouraged him to. Less hijinks more kinks.", Drei commented.Caleb thought for a moment before looking at Mirabelle who returned an uncertain look."Sir, it's understandable that you still have some reservations about this whole thing, and that's perfectly fine, all you need to do is give it a chance and ease into it. Don't forget, we're still with you.", Ein encouraged."That is right, Señor.", Camilla added with Lyca and Mirabelle nodding in agreement."I-It's not so much me having reservations, I mean, I do a little but that's beside the point, what I'm thinking of right now is how I should go about this? Who do I got on a date with first? Where should we go? What do we do? You know, basic stuff like that.", Caleb replied running the back of his head."If 'who' you should go out with first is a question, I already got your answer. Lyca!", Zwei stated as the She-wolf's stood erect in surprise."Me?", Lyca stated."Yeah, why not? Besides, you're the houseguest with the second longest stay here. Makes perfect sense.", Zwei explained."I'd actually prefer if you elaborated a bit more.", Caleb said in a unconvinced tone."Ok but, right now?", Lyca replied sounding uncertain."Of course, you guys can go on a date right now if you want!", Zwei stated emphatically. Caleb was about to rebut before Lyca interrupts."Alright! Let's do it Chief!", Lyca stated unbuttoning her shorts shimmying out of them them beginning to take off her shirt to everyone's shock."LYCA NO!", "STOP", "ESPERE", "MY GODS!", "WHOaaaa!, Each of them shouted as Lyca paused looking confused."W-WHAT ARE YA DOIN?!', Caleb stated incredulously covering his eyes."Whaddya mean Chief? We're going on a date. That means we're going to mate right?", Lyca replied."NO, Nonononono! That's not what a date is Lyca!", Mirabelle added shaking her head violently and blushing bright red."Uhh..", Drei raises a finger about to speak before Ein quickly covers her mouth."Ms. Kessler, humans have special rituals they go through in order to get to know the person they're attracted to on a deeper level. You just go out and have fun doing something you'll both enjoy together.", Ein explained, "Now *ahem* please put your shorts back on.""Yes, please do, you are at eleven right now, get it down to about a four, four and a half tops!", Caleb stated.Lyca pulls her shorts and underwear back up, "Hmmm, I don't get it, I already love Chief. I already know he's kind, smart, and strong.", Lyca spoke honestly.Camilla got up and bent slightly to Lyca's level, "Señorita, I believe what they mean is, they want for us to truly connect with Señor. It is good how we feel about him but we should explore these feelings deeper by spending quality time with him. It is the best way he'll truly understand who we are and us him. Understand?", she finishes petting her head."I think so. I want to try it but I've never really been on a date so...I don't know what to do.", Lyca said with uncertainty plastered on her face.Zwei approaches with a supporting grin, "Don't sweat it Lycs, I'll explain the basics t-""I'LL explain it.", Ein interjects, "She's already misinformed as is no need to make it worse.""Oh like YOU'RE one to talk.", Zwei replied, "When's the last time you talked to a guy that wasn't a superior or a client?""T-THAT'S UNIMPORTANT! What's important is helping Ms. Kessler.", Ein stated firm as her annoyed expression dissolved.Lyca then turns Mirabelle standing up straight like a soldier, "Mira, is it ok if I go on a date with Chief?"Mirabelle, surprised by her wording and serious tone, thought for a second before responding. She glances at Caleb who shrug giving a half grin, "Lyca...y-yes, you can go on...a date with Dear."Lyca rushes over wrapping Mirabelle in a hug, "YAY, thanks Mira!", Lyca the gives a few affectionate licks to Mirabelle's cheeks; a common custom among Werewolves when showing submission and adoration towards pack mates. Mirabelle shudders at the odd sensation clearly still getting used to the feeling. Lyca releases her turning to Caleb who puts his arms up waving her off; which she ignores running into his arms and coating his cheek in hot saliva. Mirabelle watches them while discretely wiping her cheek with some tissue from her pocket.Camilla approaches her to the side catching Mirabelle's attention. The demoness knife with a supportive grin to which she grins back before looking to Caleb and Lyca again. The former holding the She-wolf's face away as she flailed want to continue her lick session."Umm, I think we're overlooking some things.", Drei says getting everyone's attention."What's that sis?", Zwei inquired."While they're on their date, what are you two going to do?", Drei says looking at Mirabelle and Camilla. The two of them pause."I...well I guess we um...", Mirabelle uttered."It...has not crossed mi mind but...", Camilla added just as puzzled"Well, I suggest you spend the day out together. It would be good practice adapting to human society when you know longer require being chaperoned by your host. Instead you'd be chaperone by one of us, call it a bi-lateral move.", Drei explained."Wait, you think that's a good idea?! The mob is still after me you know! What if they come after them too?!", Caleb stated."Don't worry, the way things are now, it's very unlikely they'd make any risky moves for the time being.", Drei answered."She's right sir, between the media attention along with the capture of one of their distinguished members and ICEP'S increasing surveillance makes their activity in this region next to impossible.", Ein added. Caleb thinks for a moment."If you're still worried, just know we'll be shadowing you the whole time. Our ICEP credentials don't just allow us free parking, we can also act as chaperones to other liminal species. I'll be going with you and the wolf, just pretend I'm not there, like teachers at junior prom.", Drei commented.Ein clears her throat, "So, Drei will be going with you and Zwei and myself will accompany Ms. Marequine and Sartana.""Actually, I think I'll go with Boss and Lyca too. They probably could use the extra help.", Zwei stated earning a suspicious look from Ein." I'm...not quite certain about that. Mr. Bizzell may need us both with them in the event something may occur.", Ein replied.Zwei frowns slightly."I mean, I'm fine with her coming too.", Caleb stated earning a grateful smile from Zwei, "Statistically speaking, I'm more secure with 4 eyes watching since...you know...I'm the one the mob's after.""I suppose you right but...", Ein uttered."Listen, it'll be OK. I trust you. You'll keep them safe.", Caleb says.Ein blushes slightly before responding, " I will, thank you sir.""Senor, do not take this the wrong way but ju are muy loco if ju think SHE can protect ME.", Camilla replied defiantly, " She was defeated by a goat child with a scythe for Discord's sake."Ein shot her an agitated look."We swear, that almost never happens to her.", Drei commented earning the same look from Ein.Win crosses her arms, "Hey, she was way more skilled than she appeared OK?!", she spoke half-truthfully, "Besides I'm mostly going to make sure you don't kill anyone for harassing or trying to harm you or Ms. Marequine.""Ju say it like it's a bad thing.", Camilla replies crossing her leg and leaning back." IT'S A BAD THING! We don't need another Angel incident! We're very lucky no one witnessed you murdering her. The public backlash would've been catastrophic AND you likely could be detained right now!", Ein stated firmly."For what?! Killing the punta that tried to kill Senor?!", Camilla shot back before feeling Mirabelle touch her arm, " Señora. ""Camila, I won't pretend I agree or approve of your actions but I can at least appreciate where your heart was. That being said, let's just do as she says. If not for ICEP than for Dear.", Mirabelle spoke solemnly.Camilla frowned slightly shifting from annoyed to understanding, "*Sigh* Alright, I promise I will listen...for now.", Mirabelle gives her a sweet smile before a sudden occurs to her."Hmmm, I suppose the only other question is what we should do while Dear and Lyca are off?", Mirabelle spoke touching her chin in thought."Believe me Moon pie, I don't even know what Lyca and I should do.", Caleb admitted looking to Lyca then back to the rest of them, "But...we have time to come up with something. Right now, I'm busy with a couple of important design projects for work. Matter of fact, I'm gonna get on back to finishing that up."Caleb headed to his office when Mirabelle spoke up, "Wait, you're still not done?!""No, I'm trying to determine the ideal flexibility ratio and running simulations on the effects of cavitation.", Caleb replied."I think she cares less about the science babble and more that you've been going at it for 3 straight days now with NO sleep.", Zwei stated, "Aren't you tired?! At all.""Not...really, now that you mention it. I feel pretty good in fact.", Caleb says before noticing all them staring at him with a different degrees of skepticism and worry, "I'm fine you guys, really. You have any idea how many allnighters I've pulled my life? Whatever happened to me during that skirmish with that Malone guy...", Caleb trails off unsure of what to say to convince them, "anyway I'm fine. I'll see you guys for dinner."He left for his office pretending to ignore the doubtful expressions on their faces. He could hear them talking as he entered his office and closing the door. He gives a long exhale before pulling down his shirt looking at the mark on his chest....Present...Caleb looks at himself in the mirror tracing the mark on his chest experimentally. He sighs before putting on his blue DBZ Sayain t-shirt and beige cargo pants."Everything's fine, everything's fine.", Caleb repeats to himself before putting on his outdoor shoes and grabbing a beige hiking bag. He was dressed for his date, he had the entire day off from work, now time to make breakfast.After careful deliberation, Caleb decided on the perfect activity for a date with Lyca. A nature hike. It something they can both enjoy, it's relatively simple, and it's great exercise; which she loves and he DEFINITELY needs. Needless to say, Lyca was more than ecstatic about the idea.Caleb sits his bag below the counter and heads to the fridge for eggs, a pack of back, and milk. He turns on two burners and melts some butter in two skillet. He walks over to the cabinet and grabs a couple large serving plate. He cracks some eggs and opens the bacon pack before adding them to pans then stirring them up. Crackling sounds of the popping oil and aroma and the food fills the area. After a couple minutes, he scoops the piles of eggs and bacon into the large plate then goes to the fridge for the steak and veggies for Moon Pie's said. Suddenly, he could hear this scraping sound like glass sliding against a rough surface. His eyes widen upon seeing the top cabinet he just got the serving plates from slowly opening. A large plate slides out about to fall."Shit!", Caleb exclaimed turning to the cabinet not even closing the refrigerator door. Time slows in his mind and...suddenly...zoom (ok I don't know an onomatopoeia for this so just think of a shorter version of "The Hand" sound effect from JoJo pt 4).Before Caleb could process what happened, he finds himself holding the plate at the cabinet door while securing the others. He remains stunned as he looks between the open fridge on the other side of the kitchen to the where he was now; a good 15 feet away. How the hell did he get over here so quickly?"Buenos Dias Señor!(Good morning!), came the cheerful voice of Camilla startling Caleb a bit. She wore a red elbow length linen shirt that exposed her collar bone and gave a good view of her cleavage along with light blue jean that accentuated her curves and red round toe heeled shoes. She then notices the open fridge, "Oh, Señor, ju left the door open. The food could spoil."Caleb shakes out of his thought and slides the plate closing the cabinet door, "Oh...r-right. I'll get it.""Allow me, I am sure ju have your hands full right now.", Camilla spoke going to the refrigerator door.'You have...nooo idea.", Caleb thought looking at the cabinet again. He then notices Camilla create a magic seal before the two steaks, a ball of lettuce and other assorted raw veggies float from the fridge. The steaks sizzles upon contact with the hot skillet before turning themselves over. Camilla picks a large bowl placing it on the counter, then opens the droor creating a blue magic seal. Four knives float out and begin chopping and slicing the veggies."You know this neeever gets old.", Caleb stated taking the welcome distraction.Camilla giggles with a smile, picking up a spatula, "Huhuhu, I suppose to ju it's an unexplainable phenomenon that could fill volumes of research books. To me...it is as phenomenal as blinking.", Camilla dismissively waves placing a package of tortilla and shredded cheese on the counter."Yeah well, I believe there's logical behind everything. I have a few theories of what you call 'magic' actually is that'll totally debunk any preconceived notion people have instead of stepping backwards another four centuries.", Caleb stated in mild annoyance."Save it for the scholars professor and hand me the cayenne ", Camilla playfully scoffed. Caleb rolls his grabbing from the spice rack and handing it to her."Gracias", She smiles sweetly at him making his heart flutter. She cracks some more eggs and sprinkles cheese on them."Ahem, so you excited for today? It's gonna be just you, Moon pie, and Ein so...you know...girls day ouuuuut!", Caleb emphatically stated using his hand life a megaphone. Camilla shakes her head." 'Excited' is not the word I'd use but I believe it should be interesting.", Camilla replied finishing the stack of quesadillas taking two for herself and seasoning them."Where you guys going again?", Caleb inquired taking a box of blueberry muffins from the and throwing some in the microwave."The comedreja (weasel) is taking us to something called a 'cafe' she called it, that is run almost entirely by liminals.", Camilla replied.Caleb thought for a second , "That sounds nice. At least, it's somewhere MORE open to liminals.", he says before feeling his phone vibrate in his pocket."Jes, perhaps I can enjoy a meal outside the house without being vilified for mi race.", she spoke understanding what he meant, "And hopefully not run into more filthy Angels.", she spoke with a slightly venomous toneCaleb frowned clutching the phone to his side."I wouldn't worry too much about that.", came the voice of EinCamilla and Caleb whipped their heads around to see The Zyklons. Ein standing at attention like a disciplined soldier, Zwei sitting at the counter awaiting to be fed, and Drei t-posing on the couch."You guys could've at least knocked you know.", Caleb says in slight annoyance already used to ICEP knocking being good with respecting privacy."We DID send a text.", Zwei said."We respected your privacy by alerting you but asserted our authority as your bodyguards by coming in anyway.", Drei commented."Whatever, just don't pull anymore Sterlings or I may consider letting Camilla put that 'trap spell' of hers to use", Caleb replied eerily."Ju either ring or feel the sting", Camilla added threateningly putting up a red magic seal."Yeesh, put THAT on a welcome mat.", Zwei recoiled back."Aaanywayyyy, there is no need to worry, I have done considerable research on the area we'll be visiting, including criminal activity in the last 2 years, facility operating hours, and records on liminal human violence. Whatsmore, it's only 15 minutes from yours and Ms. Kessler's location making it optimal in a critical emergency.", Ein proudly reported."She even cross referenced yelp reviews for all the establishment. All of them! Even CATO and nobody ever buys anything there.", Drei commented ceasing her t-pose."Overly thorough as always Ein", Caleb says sitting three plates of egg quesadillas, bacon, and blueberry muffins down for them, "Thank you."The Zyklons bow and accept the plates of food, "K̄hxbkhuṇ māk(Many thanks)", they spoke simultaneously in their native tongue before starting on breakfast."Did they...always do that before or am I just crazy?", Caleb whispered to Camilla."I believe that would imply I am loco too.", Camilla whispered back."Oh my, this is delicious. What is it?", Ein inquired holding a piece of quesadillas on her fork."It is a quesadilla.", Camilla stated, "A common staple among mi patria (homeland)" 'Ca-so-dihlah', hehe that's fun to say.", Zwei giggles as the melted cheese dangles off her fork, " 'Caso-DILAH! Cahso-dilla! Caso-Dealer.' ", She dramatically says playing with the word and taking another bite. Ein and Drei gives unamused looks with Camilla looking annoyed at her."HIIIIII ZWEI!", Lyca announced rushing towards her wrapping her in a hug. Zwei chokes and coughs on her queso piece. Camilla giggles softly in satisfaction returning to cooking."*Ack* *cough cough* Ly-! *cough*", Zwei coughs before Caleb gives her a cup of water which she immediately chugs."AH, SORRY sorrysorrysorry, Zwei!", Lyca apologizes patting her back." *clears throat* Haaa it's *cough* alright.", Zwei wheezes catching her breath."Yeah she's been pretty excited all morning.", Caleb says going to Lyca patting he head to assure all was well. He then notices her attire consisting of black cargo shorts, armless camos shirt, brown belts straps on her wrists, ankles, and throat, still no shoes, but Caleb was used to that since they weren't meant for them anyway. She wore sports bandaged on her soles for extra support."I can see that. ", Zwei says before taking another drink of water."Here ju are Señora Lyca.", Camilla spoke as a tray of steaks, bacon, eggs, and a muffin levitate towards Lyca. Lyca smiles widely her tail wagging energetically."Thanks Cami!", Lyca stated happily taking the tray then going to the living room and pulling out one of the couch table trays."Good morning, everyone!", came the voice of Mirabelle. They every turned to with a welcoming atmosphere."Buenos Dias Señorita Mirabelle!", Camilla stated."Morning Ms. Marequine, are you ready for today.", Ein inquired finishing her food."As I'll ever ever be, yes.", Mirabelle replied. Caleb notices her attire consisting of her usual black cape over her horsehalf, a light purple dress shirt with a Sailor Moon t-shirt underneath along with a crescent moon pin in her hair."Mornin' moon pie, you're sounding chipper this morning.", Caleb spoke with a wink handing her a bowl of salad which she graciously accepts."I suppose I have a every right to be. It started brilliantly( British term for great) after all and I hope it ends just as so.", Mirabelle spoke with hint of sauciness going to Ein's previous spot on the counter accepting a fork from Camilla."Don't worry, I guarantee it will.", Caleb replied earning a knowing grin from Mirabelle."I'll hold you to that Dear. I've been awfully...peckish lately.", Mirabelle spoke with a wink."Can we move it along or do we have to listen to more innuendos?", Drei commented finishing her muffin. Caleb and Mirabelle go silent in embarassment.Eventually all of them finished their breakfast and each group prepared to leave for their outings. Caleb cleaned and put away the dish with help from Camilla as Mirabelle straightened up the living room. Zwei, Drei, and Lyca went next door to arm the alarm system. Caleb thought is was odd it took THREE of them to that but he chose not to think too much of it."Ok, there we go." , Caleb spoke as he finished wiping down the counter while Camilla dispelled her magic seal. Suddenly a horn sounded outside and Ein came in."Ms. Marequine, Ms. Sartana, our trolleys here!", Ein announced to them."Ok, we'll be out.", Mirabelle answered grabbing her small purple wall purse then going up to Caleb, "See you again soon my love.""I'm not going off to war you know.", Caleb replied and she shakes her head before sharing a tender kiss. He pats her shoulder with a smile, "have fun babe."Mirabelle nods and rushes out the door to get her seat. Caleb watches her not noticing Camilla approaching from behind. He flinches feeling something trace up his back. He turns to see Camilla grinning devilishly over his left shoulder. Her tail snakes up and down his leg as she lay her arm on his right shoulder."Enjoy yourselves Señor and remember...I am next.", Camilla whispered seductively in his ear. His throat goes dry as a she mushes her visible cleavage against his arm."Y-yeah, got it, y-you too.", Caleb replied a bit flustered."Ms. Sartana! If you're done, we have a ride to catch.", Ein stated firmly pointing to trolley still blowing it's horn."bien, bien(fine, fine)", Camilla waves dismissively suddenly she feels Caleb lightly touch her chin. They lock eyes and she stares back expectantly."Have fun, ok?", He spoke sweetly. She blushes and grins back before quickly pecking his cheek leaving him stunned for a moment as she left out the door passing Ein."We'll be back later Mr. Bizzell.", Ein says about to leave."Wait!", Caleb stops her in her tracks grabbing her hand."Y-yes sir?", She says turning to see the forlorn look in his eyes."Just...be safe out there. You know with everything going on...be careful. All of you.", Caleb stated referring to the number of incidents following the interspecies marriage law.Ein's eyes widen at his genuine concern before returning an assured, "We will, don't worry sir.", That response was good enough for Caleb.Ein then blushes seeing him still clasping her hand, "Um...sir. My hand?"Caleb's eyes widened retracting his hand, "Right sorry, sorry. You should go now...the driver sounds paused ""Right! Ok, bye sir! Don't forget to arm the security system!", Ein stated running to the trolley creating a gust of wind to lunge her toward the open door. The trolley pulls away as Caleb watches Mirabelle and Camilla waving from the windows. He waves them off then turns to grab his bag then arm type in the code on the key panel arming the system. He then sees Lyca and Zwei exit the Zyklon' s home next door with Drei closing the door behind them. They appeared to be discussing something but he couldn't make it out.Caleb goes to his cars unlocking the doors and trunk before putting his bag inside."Ok, you got it?", Caleb faintly heard Zwei say."Yeah, got it.", Lyca whispered back before turning to Caleb with a toothy grin, "Ready to go, Chief?""Yeah, I am.", Caleb replied, "hehe, what are you girls talking about?""Nothing, just girl chit chat.", Zwei replies innocently before nudging Lyca."Y-yeah, just normal girl talk.", Lyca replied in a similar tone.Caleb raises an eyebrow suspiciously before noticing they were missing someone, "Where's Drei?""Up there.", Zwei points to the top of a Caleb house, "She's going tail us the way there to watch for anything out of the ordinary.""Oh, ok.", Caleb says before closing the trunk, "Alright, let's go then."Caleb opens the passenger door for Lyca who reluctantly gets in not looking forward to being confined to the vehicle's small space. Caleb starts the car as Zwei gets in the back. Zwei stick her arm out making a salute sign with her hand and Drei does the same.Caleb pulls out the driveway into the streets and heads off to their destination.Drei prepares to follow them, then notices the old lady again. This time walking two cats on shoestrings. Drei narrows her eyes and makes an 'I'm watching you' gesture with her hand before leaping and pursuing Caleb's car.The ride was fairly uneventful. Traffic was quite favorable and they saw lots of passersbys and buildings. Caleb let Lyca stick her head out the window; not many cars on the road so it fine. Plus, it made her feel less confined. As strange as the sight of a wolf girl hanging head out car was, it got stranger during a heated but brief altercation between Lyca and a German shepherd at a traffic light. Caleb tried getting a handle on the situation while Zwei laughed hysterically in the behind him.15 minutes later they arrive at their destination; Madison county Nature Trail aka Green Mountain Trail. A three square mile park surrounded by rugged terrrain, plentiful fields, large clear lake connecting to the Black Warrior river and 72 acres of trees surrounding the area. They pull into the parking lot noticing only five other vehicles, two of them clearly belonging to the park rangers. The proceed to entrance into the park and come upon the small lodge that served as the ranger station. They were greeted by one of the park rangers; a middle aged short Caucasian woman in green slacks, beige dress shirt, and utility belt."Hi there, welcome to the Green Mountain Trail. Are y'all hiking the trail or fishing?", The woman spoke with a delightful Southern white lady accent smiling at them."We're just hiking the trail today.", Caleb answered gesturing to Lyca and Zwei. Lyca hopped in place anxiously earning smile from the ranger."Ok, I just need you to sign your names on our hikers board.", The lady points to a clipboard fashioned to a stand. They go over and sign their names. The ranger picks up the clipboard."Lyca Kessler", she said a Lyca grinned tail wagging, "Caleb Bih-zzill""It's pronounced Bih-ZZELL.", Caleb stated in annoyance."Oh, Bih-ZZEL, I'm sorry.", The ranger apologizes then moves on, "annnd...Gloria Holle?""It's a family name.", Zwei shrugs and Caleb gives her a look."Ok, just take this trail guide and in the event of emergency go to the nearest designate safe zone on the guide for assistance.", She says as Caleb puts the trail guide in his bags side pocket."Alright, thanks.", Caleb says"Thank you, hope y'all enjoy y'all selves out there. ", She waves them off as they head into the entrance of the park. Lyca immediately runs ahead of them as Zwei notices Caleb staring at her."What?", Zwei inquired"Oh nothing...Gloria.", Caleb jeered"What? It's an alias I'm working on.", Zwei said with a shrug."And you choose one that sounds like a femme fatel bond villain sex pun? , Caleb spoke incredulously."Hey, SHE didn't question it any further. Everyone is too polite in today's society to name shame or any kind of shame. So I guess it just works.", Zwei said with a heap of pride as they walked along the stone trail."I don't know if that's ingenious, idiotic, or manipulative.", Caleb replied."Then it's working.", Zwei replied proudly.Caleb shakes his head before focusing on Lyca running around in cheerfully laughing and rolling around in the foliage before getting on all fours running a few circles around him and Zwei. She then runs up to the top of a large cliff formation overlooking the lake. She outstretched her arms wide inhaling the fresh forest air. Caleb and Zwei look on happy to see her so content. Lyca turns and runs up to Caleb and wrapping him in a hug nuzzling his chest. He nearly stumbled back but quickly regains his bearings."Thanks for bringing me here Chief!", Lyca spoke looking up with bright amber eyes, "It's been sooo long since I've been in a real forest! It almost feels JUST like my old home!""Heh, almost?", Caleb inquired"Well yeah, it isn't nearly as cold as it would be around time of year.""Give it a couple more months, you'll be right at home. Like how I'll be at home keepin' warm", Caleb replied walk."Haha good one chief.", Lyca chuckled."Aheh-hem!", Zwei audibly clears her throat getting Lyca's attention."I-I mean...you are so cute when your funny Chief", Lyca speaks trying to sound like a girl flirting but coming off as a creepy old guy in a club flirting. Lyca then awkwardly winks. From behind, Zwei gives a weirded out look before shifting to a strained smile nodding and giving two thumbs up."Uhhhhhh, thank you?", Caleb says a bit confused by her sudden behavior, "You wanna continue up the trail Lyca?"Lyca gives a slightly disappointed look before smiling at him, "Yeah! Let's go!""I'll go do some scouting ahead of you guy. You two just follow the trail. See ya.", Zwei says launching herself passed them with a sharp whirlwind. As she passes, whispers something that only Lyca could pick up with her sharp hearing.Good start, remember what we practiced and he'll be putty in your handsLyca nods to herself understandingly. After the awkward event where she tried openly mating with Chief, it became abundantly clear she had no real experience in the field of seduction or dating. That is why, Zwei, with Drei's help, took it upon herself to be her romance coach.As Caleb walks ahead beside her, she recalls something she learned.'Ok, again, like this sway-step, sway-step', Zwei says swaying her cute little heart-shape butt in black spandex, 'move like you're minding your own business but make sure his eyes are drawwwn to the booty.'Lyca nods to herself. She walks ahead of Caleb, "Haaa, I feel so free!", she exclaims extending het arms out welcomingly."Yeah, it is good to get out like...this.", Caleb trails noticing Lyca swaying her hips with each step. Her tight cargo pants accentuating every step of her toned round butt and muscular thighs. Her camo shirt gave a shapely view of her lean back and sexy midriff.'Draw him to the booty, draw him to the booty.', Lyca repeated in her head stealthily looking over her shoulder to see him walking while shifting his gaze from her to the lake. She grinned to herself excited that it was working.Caleb decides he's been oggleling her like a creep long enough a quickly jogs up next to her, "H-Hey! Uhh...""Yes Chief?", Lyca asks innocently."R-Race ya to the first rest stop?", Caleb spoke nervously immediately regretting those words.Lyca beams excitedly at him, "Heck yeah! On your mark! Get set! GO!", She stated before taking off with blinding speed that would make a Kenyan boy weep with envy. Caleb runs off after her in a futile attempt to catch up. He curses himself the entire way for making RUNNING the first thing he does on his date; even if it was a distraction from what his brain had in mind moments ago.Perched atop a tall tree branch, Zwei was overlooking the pair with her binoculars. Using her 'Voice of the Wind', the sound of their conversation reverberates back to her ears. Drei then appears with a light breeze beside her."Status report?", Drei inquired."She...started off rocky with the flirting but made some recovery with the sexy walk.", Zwei stated, "You?""Nothing warranting suspicion. I did see a guy sketching some deer and touching himself.", Drei says gesturing for binoculars."Another nature enthusiast huh? Well at least Lycs is enjoying herself.", Zwei spoke candidly handing the binoculars to Drei."Why is Caleb jogging by himself?", Drei inquired."He challenged her to a race to the rest stop.""Ooooooooh, bad call.", Drei uttered in pity."Bad call indeed.", Zwei agreed."Looks like she's coming back. Good thing too, he looked quite winded. She checking on him.", Drei replied, "Annnnd he looks like he's going to throw up. Come on, come onnnnn...thaaat's right hold it back. Hold it in like Cambodian prostitute. Good boy.""Well...she's earning points by trying to help.", Zwei spoke in an unconvincing tone as Drei gave her a dry stare. Zwei sighs and says, "I'll...go help her out."Zwei leaps down before bouncing off a gust of wind heading for Caleb's position. Drei used the binoculars and looks to the other end of the forest to see one of the park ranger throwing the deer sketching guy against the hood of the truck and handcuffing him."Awww, is that necessary? The man's just expressing his love for nature.", Drei spoke in mock sympathy....Meanwhile...The trolley pulls off as the last liminal family disembarks. Ein, Camilla, and Mirabelle are seen on the standing on the sidewalk of small shopping district called Lane Plaza. There were a multitude of shop, restaurant, and stands with humans and Liminals of different species selling their merchandise. All around them they could see humans and liminals mingling or going about their lives, cars passing down the street, and even a few MON workers on duty to break up any altercations. Winged liminals like harpy, wyvern, and even insect types like hornets or even butterflies could be seen flying about. It was definitely more diverse than the last shopping district they visited.Mirabelle looked around at all the shops as Camilla did the same both feeling different degrees of uneasiness. The former upon realizing it was the first time Caleb wasn't with her to take the lead. The latter feeling anxious in general being surrounded by so many strangers."Hmm, where do you want to go first?", Ein inquired scrolling her phone, "There are a couple of good bakeries here, Oh, and it looks like they're a having mini cultural exhibition where Liminals sell merchandise from their homelands.""Those...sound nice...but I would like to do something a bit simpler first. It's my first time being out without Dear to guide me so...", Mirabelle admitted feeling a bit ashamed."And I would prefer anywhere less...lively. I do not do well in crowds; they tend to stress me out.", Camilla replied.Ein searched her phone, "Well, there are a couple of Cafe's nearby. I'm sure the ambience and will help you both acclimate. There's one just around that corner that I'm sure you'll enjoy.""That sounds lovely.", Mirabelle says before looking to Camilla who nods in agreement as long as she get anywhere quieter."Alright, let's go.", Ein motions for them to follow.As they walk down the sidewalk, Camilla and Mirabelle look in the stores seeing humans and liminals socializing, eating together, and chatting, with some forming groups or even couples. There were even some liminal children seen playing in a small arcade with human children. They passed a few Liminal stands where one of them appeared to be a shark liminal woman with an amphibious breathing apparatus selling shark tooth based jewelry. Mirabelle couldn't decide if that was gross or just weird. Camilla spotted a butterfly liminal selling acrylic paintings of landscapes and abstract floral patterns which caught her interest.They soon arrived at the cafe, named Good Company Cafe bizarrely enough, which featured a modern contemporary theme along with bright floral colors. They chose a table outside overlooking the center of the plaza where a huge water fountain stood. Mirabelle simply stood by the table as Camilla and Ein found empty chairs. The waitress, who was an blonde elf girl, approaches their table with menus."Good morning, let me know when you're ready to order.", She spoke bowing slightly.They each thought for a moment then briefly discussed their pick."I'll have two New York style cheesecake slices and a green tea please.", Ein said politely hand the waitress her menu." I will have...a slice of chocolata cake and iced coffee. ", Camilla said before giving back her menu. The waitress nods then turns to Mirabelle." And what will you have ma'am?"" U-um...I'll have three white chocolate macadamia biscuits and Jasmine tea.", Mirabella spoke."I'm...sorry ma'am but we don't sell biscuits.", the waitress said politely."O-of course you do. I saw them on the top display case on the way in.", Mirabelle explained a bit confused." I-I'm sorry but the only thing we up there are cookies.","Yes! Biscuits!", Mirabelle stated.The elf waitresses goes silent." She's from the U.K. please bring them for her.", Ein said."Y-Yes, my apologies, I'll be right back.", The waitress takes her menu then goes to get their orders.Camilla and Ein notices Mirabelle quietly looking down in shame." Ju know, ju are both wrong. They are called 'galletas' ", Camilla said with a smirk.Mirabelle looks up curiously. Camilla glances at Ein who quickly understands." Actually, no, you're all wrong. They are called Bǐnggān.", Ein spoke allowing her Chinese accent to fully take over.Camilla snorted and chuckled, "Que? That is how you say it?", Camilla chortles as Ein glares in slight annoyance, " 'Bǐnggān' it doesn't even SOUND like food. Try it Señora. "" Uh...'Bǐnggān'...hehehe is does feel strange to say.", Mirabelle giggles touching her lips."Oh please, at least 'Biscuit' sounds like a food. What the hell even is a 'Galleta'?", Ein says trying out the foreign word herself." Ugh, it sounds gross coming out of your mouth.", Camilla playfully reviles."Allow me. 'Ga-lle-ta', how's that?", Mirabella says" Slightly better coming from ju but still weird.", Camilla replies leaning back in her chair."Well I think we can all agree that 'Coo-kies' definitely sounds the weirdest.", Ein stated." Now THAT we can agree on.", Mirabelle spoke through a chuckle."Convenida(agreed)", " Agreed", Ein and Camilla spoke simultaneously giggling.The waitress returns pushing a small cart."Here are your orders.", she says before placing each of their requested orders on the table before leaving."I mean, why do these yanks called them 'COOKies'?", Mirabelle says holding up one of her biscuits, "You don't COOK the bloody things you BAKE them.", she stated before taking a bite."That's...actually a good point.", came another person's voice. They turn to whoever was eavesdropping on their conversation. It was a Caucasian human woman with brown hair, blue eyes, a slender figure, and wearing blue skinny jeans with orange V-neck blouse with match orange sash around her neck and black hipster glasses, "Oh, sorry! Sorry, I just happen to come and heard you...and...", she utters feeling embarrassed.Mirabelle's eyes widen, "Wait, have we met?", She says as Camilla observes the human woman before realization hits her."No I don't th-", the woman starts before she takes a good look at them and realization hits her too, "Wait. Wait I remember you guys! From my job, that whole thing with the Angel and those people a couple weeks ago!", the woman spoke excitedly approaching their table. Camilla immediately becomes defensive and Ein watched their surroundings for anyone suspicious. This could be a ploy."Yeah! They thought she attacked one of the customers", she says gesturing to Camilla, " and then the Angel showed up and that made everything worse! Then you and that short coordinator who...kinda Looks like you actually shows up!", She gestures to Ein, "Hahaha that day was INSANE!""I-Indeed", Mirabelle says rubbing her cheek, "Um, pardon me, but I've forgotten your name.""Oh, it's ok. I'm Cheryl. Cheryl Banks.", Cheryl stated before noticing something, "Hey wasn't there a guy with you last time? And a Kobold girl?This seems to increase Ein's suspicion of her."Oh, they're away right now, it's just us out and about.", Mirabelle explains. Ein gives her a questioning look before rising from her seat."Um, Ms. Banks, it's nice to see you again but I'm currently supervising them on a private cultural outing. Sorry but I have to ask you to leave.", Ein stated. Cheryl smile fades then she notices Camilla's cold expression as she sat crossing her arms."O-oh...i'm sorry. I didn't mean to impose. I'll leave you guys alone", She turns around to leave then stops and turns to them, "Listen, again I'm very sorry y'all had to go though all that. Especially you ma'am,", she says to Camilla, "I know I can't understand what you've gone through since then but...I want you all to know I'm glad to see you again."Ein's demeanor lighten and Camilla's cold expression dissolve a bit. Cheryl turns to leave when..."W-Wait!", Mirabelle stated, "We have an extra space perhaps...you'd like to join us?"Camilla and Ein shoot her incredulous looks. Cheryl turn with a surprised look."Really? Are you sure? I don't wanna make things weird.", Cheryl says."It WOULD be weird Senora.", Camilla spoke with a hint of venom glaring at Cheryl. Mirabelle frowns at Camilla disappointingly."Ms. Ein, is it fine if she joins us?", Mirabelle inquired.Ein thinks for a moment then approaches Cheryl towering her by a foot staring with unflinching eyes, "Are you or have you ever been affiliated with anyone with the name 'Malone'?""No, I can't say that I ever have.", Cheryl answers. Ein scans her for any hint of falsehood, she found none." I approve.", Ein spoke before turning to Camilla, "Are you ok with this Ms. Sartana?"Camilla looks away before seeing Mirabelle's pleading purplr eyes begging her not to shut herself away. Camilla sighs and says, "Fine...she can join."Mirabelle smiles happily and Ein nods taking her seat."Really?! Thank you so much!", Cheryl happily exclaimed grabbing a seat from another table and sitting between Ein and Mirabelle, "You know I'm actually so glad you said yes because I just got myself a table over there and I didn't want to have to leave but also NOT look awkward sitting there alone."Camilla gives Mirabelle an 'are you fucking kidding me?' look to which she reciprocated with her 'Give her a chance' eyes."Oh, plus", Cheryl continues, "the cake here is amaaaazing.""Here you are miss.", The elf waitress says putting a slice of chocolate cake and iced coffee in front of her to Camilla's surprise."Thank you.", Cheryl looks at her food then at Camilla's before beaming a smile at her, "Hey look, we're twinsies!", She chirps tone pointing between their plates.Camilla elicits a low, lengthy exasperated groan.WR*smooth jazz intro* I guess you wonder where I've been? The answer to that is rather long so I'll bullet point it. First off, I've been busy all throughout the month of February with college and had been taking on more hours to train new recruits at work. Also, around the same time, I had surgery. Appendicitis, so I had to deal with that little adventure. Needless to say, writing was a bit of an afterthought.So, I don't know if you've heard, but there's a pretty bad virus going around affecting BASICALLY the whole world( except Africa by they still got Ebola) and we've been advised to NOT go out for anything. Millions of workers aren't able to work, Schools across the nation are forced to switch to a completely online curriculum just to finish the semester, and toilet paper has become more valuable than platinum( like a Gold Rush but with TP). That's the bad news.Good news. All this extra free time we all have can be used to connect with old hobbies, interests, even friends. I've been writing a ton lately and can't wait to share with you guys. I've also been REALLY into Doom Eternal.Well that's my update. Hope you enjoyed the chapter make sure fav, follow, and like and If you can think of anything constructive activities to do during this nationwide epidemic, let me know in the comments. Remember folks, at the end of the day, we're all we've got. I know that's a scary thought but if we can put aside all our bullshit for even onnnnnne minute...we can do something amazing.Be safe out there and, as always, PEACE FAM!
  
    Chapter Text
    ****These events take place between Chapter 13 and 16****It was calm late afternoon weekend at Interspecies Affairs and everyone was going about their daily business. The light of the sunset bathed the entire facility in an orange and yellow veil of members, human and liminal alike, we're going about their work routine and many liminal tenants were heading back to their apartments, getting some study time in, getting ready to clock out, or just socializing.Outside in the large courtyard, there was a blue-skinned Lesser Devil girl named Hana sitting alone at a bench in front of the large water fountain reading a book she found on Japanese yokai. She was dressed in black t-shirt with a white pentagram, black heeled boots, and wore blue skirt. She giggles at the creative yet hilariously inaccurate portrayals of the liminals of her homeland. She picks up her phone checking both the time and if the girls messaged her. She and the rest were taking some much needed time off from work and studying to enjoy a night of fun. She been waiting 20 minutes now for them."Haaa, Karare doko ni iru('where are they?' in Japanese)", Hana spoke seeing it was already 4:50 pm. Suddenly, at that moment, she got her answer."Heyyy Hana!", came a voice causing the blue devil to look up and beams a smile at her Greater Devil friend, Sylvia, along with three other Greater devil girls Heidi, Sharon, and Jocelyn. Each of them smiling happily at their friend.Hana puts her book away in her purse and stands up, "Hi everyone! How have you all been?""I've been ok. Class has been exhausting. We've been given a 2 days off since the teacher gone on business this weekend. So I really need this break!", Jocelyn stated."Great! I've been good...mostly. But it'll get better I got the next few days off baby!", Sharon exclaims excitedly throwing her fists to the sky."I have been doing fine myself. Ferzhein sehr (forgive us) Hana if we are late.", Heidi shoots a look at Sylvia, "ONE of us cannot choose an outfit to save her life.""If you're referring to my desire to look worship at the alter of my thighs sexy, then I'm safe.", Sylvia stated before posing in her red minishirt, red silk shirt to hugged her curves, exposed part of her flat tummy and gave a nice view of her cleavage, a black satin jacket over it with matching high heels. She gives a cute pout, "Who'd want to hurt something this cute?"Heidi looks away with an unamused stare, "More than I'd like."They turn to Heidi falling with thoughtful expressions understanding what she meant."W-Well its fine!", Hana spoke breaking the tension, "I wasn't waiting that long. So are you guys ready to go?""I am! I'm ready to get turnt up baby!", Sylvia stated excitedly nudging Heidi. Heidi rolls her eyes hiding a small grin."Hehe, yeah but wait, we can't leave yet. Scarlett hasn't shown up yet.", Jocelyn stated as the girls each turned to each other with worried expressions."Wait, didn't you talk to her about going out with us?", Hana inquired, "What did she say?""Well...it wasn't a 'no' technically.", Jocelyn says in plaintive tone earning skeptical looks from the rest."What does that mean?", Sharon inquired."I saw her walking around the courtyard yesterday, alone, I went up to her and asked if she wanted to hang out with us.", Jocelyn explained watching faces."Annnnd?", Hana asks feeling she can already guess the answer."She...tried to get me to leave her alone...but through insightful and cunning linguistics I managed to get a RESOUNDING...'fine, whatever " out of her!""Well what are we waiting for? Let's go get her!", Sharon stated emphatically....Meanwhile...in Scarlett's apartment...Scarlett had finished getting dressed. She looks at herself in her bathroom mirror. Her outfit consisting of a black leather skirt with light brown stocking over her long leg along with low top heeled ankle length boots that help accentuate her curvaceous legs and toned butt. She wore a black cut off jacket over a red tank top with an opening that gave a nice view of her D-cups. Her long crimson red hair was shiny and silky and matched her beautiful but intimidating red and black eyes and plump, luscious pink lips. Her black folded in bat wings protruded through her jack and her slender spade tipped sensitive tail was kept wrapped around her waist like a belt. Calling her a natural beauty would be an understatement to the average person. However, to her, it was a big pain the ass.She twists her body examining every angle she could." Haaaa, what am I doing? ", she sighs in exasperation, " Why did I even agree to this?"She presses against the sink remembering how she got roped into this little 'night out'....2 days earlier...Scarlett was just leaving this week's therapy session and was on her way back to her apartment away from the wandering eyes of her peers.'Heyyyyy, Scarlett! Scarlett!', called the voice she instantly recognizes.She turns to see Jocelyn levitating down from the stairs and landing in front of her. Jocelyn goes up to her with a bubbly grin.'Oh...Jocelyn, it's you. What is it?", Scarlett spoke.'I've been waiting for you. I want to talk to you.", Jocelyn stated."A-About what?", Scarlett says it cautiously" The girls and I we're planning a bit night together. You know a break from the classes, job training, and culture lessons to just have fun. We wanted you to come with us.", Jocelyn explains"That...sounds nice but I'll pass. See you later.", Scarlett dismissively waves off while turns away. Jocelyn then glides in front of her using a magic seal on the floor." Awww come on! Please? It won't be the same without you. There'll be food, laughs, and fun! The bare necessities of life! Pleeeease say you'll come?", Jocelyn gets up close clasping her hand and looking up with sad puppy eyes and pouty lips.Scarlett hesitates trying not to get sucked in only for her resolves to be sapped by overwhelming cuteness.Scarlett let's out a sigh and says in s defeated tone, "Fine, whatever."Jocelyn beam a big smile then hugs her, "Yaayyyy!"...present...Scarlett facepalms, "uughhhhhh, I can't believe I caved in to that, what is wrong with me? I can't be that weak...am I?"She lingers on that thought for a minute before memories of someone she once knew gave her that same sweet treatment. It was cute at first, then it started to become more and more frequent. She didn't mind because... she trusted him. She loved him. Then he betrayed that trust...the second that collar locked around her neck. After that, he life was nothing but being toyed with, violated,...and...and..Scarlett is brought out of her thoughts upon hearing a crack. Then she sees her bathrooms mirror had a large spread of cracks filling it and her body surrounded in her shimmering red aura. She takes a deep breath and calms herself as her aura quickly dissipates. She slowly shakes her head massaging her temples.*Knock knock knock knock knock* came her apartment door."Hey! Scarlett, we're here", " Are you ready to go?", Came the voices of Jocelyn followed by Sharon's voice.Scarlett inhales brushing herself off then leaving the bathroom. She'll deal with the mirror later. She opens the door and is greeted with..."HIIIIIIIIII!", Hana and the girls chimed in harmony doing a little jazz hands routine. Scarlett stood wordlessly unsure of how to react." Um...hi?", She utters awkwardly waving."Are you ready for ready for a sick night?!", Sharon stated emphatically getting in her face with smile." Y-Yes, I guess.", Scarlett nervously replies."Good! Because the first stop is a leisurely constitutional at that Alraune smoothie place, you know loosen us up. THEN its off to this night club owned by the nocturnal liminalsTHEY know how to turn UP!", Jocelyn stated pumping her fist." I'm happy you're coming out with us Scarlett. It's been awhile since we've all been together.", Hana says with a sweet grin. The others pause for a moment anticipating Scarlett's reactionScarlett's eyes widen before a small grin forms, "I'm happy too Hana."The other girls glances at each other and nod in agreement."Well, what are we waiting for?! Let's get this girls night started!", Sylvia stated." WOOOOOOOOO", the rest energetically hooted before the grab hold of Scarlett, to her shock, and carry her off."W-WAIT! At least let me lock my door first!", Scarlett shouted....The group later found themselves in a smoothie shop within the I.A. shopping district that catered to a plethora of interspecies needs. The shop itself was very nice with floral patterns, decorations, and designs reminiscent of nature. In fact many of the furniture, flooring, and ceiling were constructed from durable vines and giant flower petals. The girls sat at their sunflower table each enjoying a different type of organic smoothie and a large plate of flower themed finger cakes made from Alraune nectar. The store was closing in a couple hours but the girls just needed to kill time for awhile." So...mmm...I was just stumbling around...one part of me falling asleep thanks to pills the other half instinctively looking for the nearest source of spirit energy I can absorb, right? " Sharon says recounting her full moon experience the other day."Yeah.", Sylvia answered as everyone else listened."Haha so I'm stumbling around, bumping into walls trying to get outside, then I spot this absolute babe wearing a fedora and a scarf. I'm talkin six pack abs, melon sized biceps, and a rock hard booty.", Sharon stated in a sensual manner as the girls each giggle at her while Scarlett simply listens, "So, I freakin lunge at him, I'm straddle him like a horse the lock lips with him. I'm about to get some energy from both ends hahaha!""Haha then what?", Sylvia chuckles wiping a tear from her eye."Now, I guess around that time, those pills finally kicked in because I woke up the next morning on the floor. I expected to see my nighttime babe next to me half drained but happy as all hell. That when I notice...my babe...was a COATRACK!", Sharon stated making the girls pause."Hnnffftttt WHAT?", Sylvia exclaims nearly strangling on her smoothie before laughing heartily then being joined by the rest." *chuckle* Yeah, hahaha, I guess the fedora scarf I had hanging there threw me off. THE BALL SHAPED *wheezing laughter*...t-the ball shaped hook part was covered in my spit...and the shaft OH Discord...i've never seen wood so shiny!"Hana and the rest burst into fits of laughter along side Sharon who kept her head down pounding the table petals. Scarlett couldn't helped giggling to herself herself as well."Haaa...Haaa...ahhhh fuck. What about you Heidi? What was the full moon like for you and Sylvia?", Sharon spoke as her chuckles lighten.Sylvia and Heidi tense up with heavy blushes starting to form."Oh, n-nothing in particular! We took our sleeping pills on time and we slept through it! That's about it!", Sylvia spoke avoiding eye contact with everyone; especially Heidi."J-Ja, v-very uneventful. Nothing significant und life changing at all eheheheheh.", Heidi chuckled awkwardly."Are ya sure? Almost seems like it.", Jocelyn inquires eyebrow raised then tilting her head, "Actually I've been meaning to ask you about that weird mark on your neck."Jocelyn says pointing to the reddish discoloration on the lower part of her neck. Sylvia and Heidi blush even harder with the latter beginning to sweat nervously."O-oh, i-it's nothing. It's...just...ummm-", Heidi murmured getting backed into a corner before Sylvia steps to her rescue."She got burned! Y- yeah she got burned by the iron this morning! It's a long story no need to bore you with the details, k?", Silvia stated hoping they wouldn't dig any deeper. Scarlett raises an eyebrow as if saying, 'Really?'"Ohhhh, that must've really hurt.", Hana says with genuine concern"J-Ja...b-but it is fine.", Heidi insisted."You sure? It looks kinda red, weird how it hasn't healed by now.", Sharon stated."She used a lot of mana yesterday so it's taking longer than normal. Heyyy so what about you Hana?", Sylvia says hoping to change the subject."Well, I took my sleeping on time too so I pretty much slept through it.", She replies shyly scratching her chin, "Oh but before I went to bed, I got one of those video call things from the twins in Japan!"Heidi and the rest lighten up instantly."For real?! How are they?!", Sharon stated."They're doing great! They're living with this new host who seems to be on really good terms with Devils.", Hana replied gladly."That's so awesommmme. Man, I wish they were still here too. I miss those little guys.", Jocelyn says a bit sadly."Yeah, but at least they're doing well.", Sharon spoke, "Their lives are changing for the better at least.""I can say the same for us too. Coming here, I feel...we've all changed a bit.", Hana spoke solemnly as the rest give the same look with Scarlett shifting her gaze out the window."You're right, Hana. I do feel like I changed a little.", Sharon replies before drinking more of her smoothie."For the first time in a long time, I actually feel...safe.", Silvia added.Scarlett looks down at one of the little cakes in her hand. 'Safe', she thought sullenly to herself.Suddenly, a giant green stalk grows out next to their table before forming into a feminine figure of a woman with luscious child-bearing hips and G-cup breasts with pink flowers covering them."Pardon me ladies, but I'm afraid we're very closing soon.", The Alraune lady spoke in a breathy, silky voice. The girls look between each other."Ok, can we take the rest of these with us?", Jocelyn asks pointing to the cakes."Sure", The Alraune spoke in a weirdly sexual tone before large pink petals grew from the plate encapsulating the cakes in a flower bulb-shaped bag. They girls look at it with a combination of amazement and confusion, " There you go sweeties. I hope you enjoy the rest of your night huhuhu."The Alraune is sinks back into the floor leaving them alone again."Alright I don't know what she's on...but I want like FIVE of it.", Sharon stated....After they finished up at the smoothie shop, the girls left for their next destination. It fairly dark out now with several street lights, buildings, and the frequent vehicle passing down the road. Rather than walk the rest of the way, they decide to stretch their wings sort of speak, fly there with their magic. Eventually they located the night club with name the Rocking X written in green and red X-shaped neon lights with big owl eyes on the bottom corners. Loud, banging dubstep (One More Time) could be heard all inside the building. A line of liminals and some humans could be seen on the side of the entrance behind a red rope with a male Blue Oni as the bouncer. They descend down in front of the entrance instantly drawing some attention. The girls look around excited and a couple slightly nervous about entering their first club. Scarlett looks around cautiously." WOO, yeah baby! Let's do, it!", Sharon stated shaking her hips to the beat."Wow, it's pretty loud here. My ears are kinda ringing. You think this is good for our sensitive ears?", Hana asks worried about her sensitive hearing."Don't sweat it guys! I got this", Sharon says reaching into her purse and pulling out a small bag of yellow ear plugs, "just put a couple of these in."Each of the girls grab a pair a put them in their ears. Immediately the music feels more comfortable to listen to. Sharon and Jocelyn give thumbs up and smiles at everyone. They head over to the entrance and are blocked by the male Blue Oni bouncer."Hi, my girls and I would like go in pretty please.", Sharon says fluttering her eyes cutely."Sorry, back of the line sweetheart.", He spoke in a deep unamused tone."Awww do we really have to go alllll the way back there.", Sharon spoke VERY flirtatously as her eye emitted a glowing pink energy.The Blue Oni gave a blank stare, "Pfft, babe you know home many times a week a chick tries puttin that googoo eyes hypnosis shit on me?""Oh?", Sharon says in a challenging tone before being joined by Jocelyn to her left and Sylvia to her right, "How about three at once?", they all spoke in unison flashing the pink eyes at him. The Blue Oni guy expression shifts into a grin before holding open the door for them. Immediately the line of people fly into a disgruntled fit screaming stuff like 'Ah, this some bullshit!' or 'what the hell was that?!'. Sharon, Jocelyn, and Sylvia subtly high give each other as they step into the club with Scarlett and the rest behind them. Scarlett looks around at the many species of nocturnal liminals, from mothmen to owl harpy to werebats dancing, socializing and drinking. The DJ was a human with hipster beard and a couple of mouse liminal girls grinding on him. As expected is was much louder and brighter inside. The sound only made bearable for her and the rest thanks to the earplugs. Scarlett sees two seperate bar each of them run by a pink mothgirl and a brown mothgirl. Scarlett couldn't help feeling a bit out of place here."Come on Scarlett, let's get us some drinks!", spoke Jocelyn snapping Scarlett out of her trance as she was pulled by the arm through the crowd. They make it to the bar and Jocelyn orders them all a round. The mothgirl gets to work as Scarlett sits at the counter and continues to look around at all the liminals and humans having a pretty good time. She then looks at Sylvia and the girls, some of them seated with her and chatting or just standing enjoying the music."Here you go!", the mothgirl stated sitting each of their drinks in front of them. The girls each took their glasses with Scarlett reluctantly taking hers as she wasn't really in to drinking."Toast! To an EPIC GIRLS NIGHT OUUUT!", Sharon announced as she raises her glass with the others following suit before klinking their glasses and downing their shot. Scarlett hesitate but thanks to peer pressure downs hers as well. To her surprise, instead of the typical bitter, alcohol taste this more...tangy. It was still quite strong but there was a sweet fruitiness and inviting flavor to it."Mmm, wow that's pretty good. What kind of alcohol is this?", Hana asked the mothgirl bartender."Oh nonono, I.A. prohibits the sell of alcohol, not that we can drink it anyway, so we sell our own natural blend of tonic made from flower nectar and fermented fruit. It has about the same kick as alcohol so still be careful not to go overboard.", The mothgirl explained.Sharon finishes her glass, " Yeah I didn't here anything after 'prohibit'. ANOTHER ROUND BABY, WOOOO!""Can I have some of that 'blue nightshade' drink right you have", Hana said pointing the bottle behind her."Um, are you sure you're old enough to drink? You awfully young to even be in here.", The pink mothgirl says referring to Hanas small stature."Hey...she's probably wayyy older you little girl.", Sylvia says stepping to Hana side, "Pretty sure we were kickin it up while your mom was still in hers mom's belly! Gimme some of that too!"The mothgirl shrugs before going to make the drinks."Entschuldigung die barfrau (excuse me bartender) , I would like that 'red hazel', bitte shön (please) danke.", Heidi said politely laying her glass in front of her.The mothgirl reluctantly nods as her antennae twitch realizing her night just got a lot harder....After a few rounds of drinks, a few of the girls were feeling a little bubbly and tipsy, especially Sharon. The found a booth and decide to sit there and finish the rest of the cakes from the smoothy shop. Scarlett plaintively sips her drink making sure to keep her glass close to her but also the girls as well ensuring no one sketchy came near."I mwean this...bitch where I work...I'm doing a clibents hair right?", Sharon says her face flushed and a bit lispy after tonic number 6, "She-She has the nerve, the lady balls, to tell me to cover my chest. I'm wearing an apron already it's not my fault if a little cleavage shows." Sharon emphasizes cupping under her breasts pushing them up, "Chaos dammit, I believe she's just jealous. She's the sexy appeal of dirty potato and I could melt heart of any boy in a 2 mile radius."Jocelyn finishes her fourth glass, "Yeah girl, that's what it's allll about. You won't believe the stuff I hear people whisper about me on the way I look or how I act. It's jealousy. They hate shit about themselves and they look at me, us really, as the pinnacle of sex appeal and they're envious."Scarlett rolls her eyes in disgust staring down into her red drink. Suddenly, the music changes starting with a upscale rap beat.'There she go, shakin' that was on floor, bumpin' and grinding that poll. The way she's grinding that poll I think I'm losing control.', The song plays as Sharon lunges up excitedly and rocking the table a bit."Oh discord yeah, this is my JAM!", Sharon makes a yellow magic seal and levitate herself from the table over to the dance floor. As she lands people make room for her. Sharon starts dancing to the rhythm.*Ok, now imagine this next scene being a combination of the torture dance from the jojo pt 5 anime and Rick's dance from Rick and Morty*Heard muthafuckers talk, seen and I ain't got a weapon I'm a pick up a rock. And when I bust yo ass I'm a continue to rock. (As Sharon dances, Sylvia floats over and joins her. Hana and the rest remain seated watching in awe.) Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet. It's real easy just follow the beat. Don't let that fine girl pass you by.. (Jocelyn floats over and joins them as the crowds cheers at them excitedly.). Look real close cause strobe lights lie. 'We 'bout to have a party( Sharon, Jocelyn, and Silvia create blue magic seals and their bodies glide in place shaking their hips alluringly) Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt) I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut) Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up. Some girls they act retarded. Some girls are bout it bout it. I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck. I say everyday she be givin' it up. Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me, Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me. Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me. Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me (The trio shake their hips with the harmony of three sexy metronome.)The girls finish their dance and high fives each other as the crowd goes crazy. The trio triumphantly strut back to their table."That. Was. The coolest thing EVER!", Hana stated with stars in her eyes."Indeed, Wunderbar!", Heidi stated clapping her hands."Hehe, that was pretty cool.", Scarlett happily admitted."I KNOW RIGHT?! We didn't even practice ANY of that! We just...FELL into it!", Sylvia stated."That was COMPLETELY in ONE go and we FUCKIN killed it!", Sharon stated in both disbelief and amazement.Suddenly, they are approached by a group of 7 Orcs. All of them with a Mohawks dyed a different color of the rainbow, leather and jean jackets and pants with either a t-shirt or regular shirt. They each wore some type of accessories from brass knuckle, to plain silver earring or nose rings. They each stared at the girls with intrigue and hunger."Yo! That was one hell of a show you girls put on just now. The boys and I couldn't take our eyes off ya!", The largest of the group grunted. He had a bright red Mohawk and a large golden ring in his snout; obviously the leader. Scarlett is the first to be on gaurd."Well...thanks! Not gonna lie, we really didn't know what we were doing.", Jocelyn spoke sheepishly before noticing on the orcs with a yellow Mohawk get uncomfortably close smiling and looking her up and down."I wouldn't say that. *snort* I'd say you knew exactly what you were doing.", yellow says as Jocelyn takes a step back noticing how he was looking at her...hungrily."*snicker* Yeah, why don't you girls give us a little encore? I'd really like to see the blue beauty over there shake it!", blue Mohawk says staring right at Hana making the little devil recoils back into her seat next to Heidi.Red Mohawk angrily knocks both of his subordinates in the head making them cry out in pain. A few of the girls flinch back at the act of barbarism. Red mohawks angered expression shifts to a calmer but even creepier look grin, "Sorry, what my associates are trying to ask is if you lovely ladies would join us for a few drinks."Sharon steps up, "No, we're good. This is a Girls night out, no dicks allowed piggy. Why don't you guys go party with some girls more up your alley?""Yeah I think I some black slime in the restroom a minute ago!", Sylvia stated bursting into laughter with Sharon quickly joining in. The leader immediately glares down with a furious look. He grabs a Sharon by the arm making her yelp."Well maybe you'd want to make it a mixer! Come on, let us keep you beautiful ladies company tonight!", Red spoke licking his lips looking at Sharon's cleavage. The other orcs surround the table to block their way out."I said NO! Let me go you're hurting me!", Sharon cries out as people in the crowd turn their table."Don't act all high and mighty Devil! Be good little sluts and come have some fun with us.", Red Mohawk says pulling Sharon close about to lick her neck while Blue and Green Mohawk started to corner Heidi and Hana and the others approached Sylvia and Jocelyn.Suddenly Red Mohawk gets a fist shrouded in burning red aura to the face before falling back on his butt clutching his face in pain and whining about the stinging sensation. The other orcs and the girls look to Scarlett fangs bared, Red aura surging around her body, and her face in sickened scowl while her eyes burned bright red.Scarlett stands over glaring at the leader, "I have a better idea. Why don't you leave before seer genitals right off your bodies and then force feed the remains to you."Red Mohawk glared at her clasping his broken snout the glancing at Yellow.Yellow rushes Scarlett only to her kneed in the gut by Sharon before falling down clutch his stomach."OH sorry, looks like you tripped and hit my knee.", Sharon chortled. It was around this time the DJ started to play a new song.'I came to dance, dance, dance. I hit the floor cuz that's my plans, plans, plans.', As it played, Red Mohawk rushes Scarlett swinging at her widely to which she easily pivots and spins dodging every hit then creating a red magic seal on his chest that sent him back with a burst of red lightning. He recoils as red sparks permeated his body before charging again.Hana takes the opportunity to deliver a double kick to Blue's nutsack followed by Heidi creating a yellow magic seal and flinging him and Green out of their booth. Heidi gets up as Sylvia and Jocelyn now to each other before create white magic seals under Purple and Orange's feet. The two orcs find their bodies frozen stiff. The two girls smile devilishly flicking their fingers making the orcs glide with the seal at their feet moving their fingers in a circular motion causing the two Orcs to spin in place going faster and faster like spinning top.Heidi chuckles at the scene unaware of Blue, having recovered, rushing towards her pulling out a big hunting knife. Hana quickly creates blue magic seal at her feet sends her flying upwards. She creates another in midair bouncing off to change trajectory and lunges feet first toward Blue colliding with his face sending him spiraling to the floor. He tries pick himself up but is lunged upward by a magic seal then collide with another that sent him into a other. Hana chuckles devilishly as she plays pinball with the piggy.Indigo grabs Heidi by her wings twisting the hem forcing her to her knees as Green approaches with a boorish smiles unzipping his pants. Suddenly a portal opens up on the floor as a heel shoe connects with his crotch. He falls to his knees in agony before getting the heel to the face knocking him out. Indigo looks up in confusion as Sharon points at him making a circle then kicking her leg backwards. Her leg appears from a magic seal behind Indigos head knocking him forward as he clutches the back of his head groaning in pain. Heidi creates a white magic seal underneath him as he sees it and tries to run before white sparks illuminated his body making him spasm and flail wildly. Sharon and Heidi high five each other."Maaake it stooooop!" "I'm gonna puuuuke!", Orange and Purple yell as the continue to spin out of control. Sylvia and Jocelyn smile wickedly stop the two extremely dizzy orcs in place before making them crash into each other and fall on the floor. They look around to see some of the other party goers were observing their fight cheering and clapping for them. Sylvia and Jocelyn smile and victorious raise their fists. Hana ceases her game allowing Blue to fall to the floor look at Scarlett with a sense of dread.Red Mohawk falls on his back panting in exhaustion. Scarlett stands over him glaring with her demonic presence before bringing her legs over his chest before flopping her butt hard on his stomach. He gags looking up at her panting before a grin begins to form."*cough* That's...more I like it. Ride my dick you little slut.", Red snickers at her.Scarlett's eyes widen as those words cut her ears like a knife. As she looks down, she sees that fat bastard who said those same words. She relives every time he molested her, raped her, beat her. With her hatred to new levels, she balls up both her fists as red aura covered them."RYAAAAAAHHHHHH!", Scarlett shrieks repeated punching and beating his face in. The music stops as every patron in the club witnesses the brutal scene shock as the Devil beat the Orc bloody."SCARLETT! SCARLETT! That's enough, you got him!", Sharon runs over and pulls Scarlett away by her shoulders as she struggles from her grasp to continue her assault."NO IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT ENOUGH!", Scarlett shouted to the top of her lungs as she just about gets free only for Sylvia and Jocelyn to hold her back as well. Hana looks at the scene in panic as Heidi steps to her side.Just then a large male Red Oni pushes through, "Alright what the hell is going on here?! You girls in here starting fights huh?""N-No! We ver keeping to ourselves until these swine started harassing us.", Heidi spoke pointing to to the Orcs as some painfully started to pick themselves up off the floor. The red Oni man approached the Orange orc picking him up by the collar."Ohh, I know these guys. I.A. kicked them out two weeks ago for bothering some of the lady tenants! Guys this time they got what they really deserve. I'll take care of them, you girls just leave, now.","What?! We didn't even do any-", Sylvia stated incredulously before her interupts in a serious tone."I SAID now!"Sylvia clutches her fists as Heidi touches her shoulder. Heidi looks towards them and Hana goes up the Sharon to a visibly pissed Sharon."Come on, we should go.", Hana says. Sharon relents knowing it's pointless to fight anymore."Let's get outta here girls. YOU TAKE CARE OF THE GAY PRIDE PIGGIES OVER THERE!", Sharon stated as she and the girl pushed through the crowd to leave.The Red Orc guy went over to Red Mohawk and saw the bloody and severely bruised state of his face. Red Mohawk groans in pain as Red Orc looks down at him."Hahaha, damn! That girl knocked you the fuck out, Ahahahaha!", Red Orc guy laughed at Red Mohawk as he passed out....After the girls leave the club, the find themselves wandering the outter regions of I.A. campus. The entire time Scarlett distance herself from them. They tried reaching out but soon decided to let her be for little while. Soon, they found themselves near a bridge with a large river running through. The shimmering waters illuminated by the half moon in the sky. The soothing sound of running waters from the aquaduct along with the distant sounds of cars gave the area a relaxing ambience.The girls sit or stood near the guard rail to catch breath and decompress from the previous situation. Hana and Sylvia played a game with their magic seals on the water. Sharon and. Jocelyn look over to Scarlett who stood several feet away from the group peering down at the rushing waters in thought. Sharon decides to try reaching out again.She slowly walks over to her, " H-Hey...Scar?"Scarlett doesn't respond. Sharon step closer."Scarlett...listen don't let those guys ruin our night.", Sharon says as Scarlett wordlessly turns away. Sharon frowns slightly, " Come on, Scar talk me. Please. ""Just...leave me alone Sharon.", Scarlett spoke.Sharon felt a spark of anger at her dismissive response, " What the helll is your problem?!"Scarlett turns to her with a serious look, "Problem?"The other girls turn to her afraid of what could transpire."Yeah, your, problem. You never talk to us or anyone else anymore! Y-You close yourself off! You're bitter and hateful! Why are you hell-bent on staying miserable?!", Sharon shouted angrily." Sharon that's enough-", Sylvia started before Scarlett interrupts."NO, LET HER SPEAK! You really want to know what my 'problem' is?! My problem is I appear to be the only one who even CARES about what they did to us! I still can't look at myself in the mirror because I hate what I've become. I was treated like a toy! I didn't have any power over my life. I was basically a SLAVE.""Yeah, I know, well ALL were. You think you're the only Devil who's been hurt, abused , or raped?! Get over yourself, at least we're TRYING to make a better life for ourselves! None of us want to be what the world sees us!, " Sharon retorts back as the girls look between each other not things to escalate any further."Well good of that.", Scarlett spoke sarcastically, " Look at us! Look how we dress, look how we act, look at our fucking boobs! You in particular flaunting yourself, putting on a show, making them look at us, see us as the sex objects they think we are! We should be ashamed of ourselves.", She stated as the girls looked themselves up and down."Oh, NOW you have a problem with how I look. Way to give'em the power. You know why I do that? It's because I'm proud of who and what I am. I love my powers, I love personality, I love my instincts and I LOVE my big tits. These are what we were born with so don't you DARE tell me to be ashamed. The second you say that, our enemies win. They win because we hate ourselves MORE than they hate us!", Sharon finished wiping a tear from her eye. Scarlett's anger wains as her shoulders slump and her arms hang limply to her sides. She has nothing. Nothing to say or even do.Hana approaches and clasps her hand then Sharon. Both look at the blue lesser devil with intrigue."D-Don't fight, please. We have to stick together.", Hana spoke. Scarlett eyes widen in surprise. Sylvia and the others approach them as well."Ja, that's right. We Devil's have to look out for each other. Ven push comes to shove, we are all we have.", Heidi spoke in a kind tone."We know you're in pain Scar, we all are. We're all doing our best to move forward we want you to move with us?", Sylvia added."You don't have to deal with this alone Scarlett. If you're hurting, talk to us, if you hate yourselves, we'll love you. You're not alone.", Sharon spoke sweetly.Scarlett opens her mouth but no words escape. Only the feeling our her throat choking up and her bottom lip trembling and eyes filling with tears as she looked the warm inviting eyes of her dearest friends gave indication of her profound sorrow. She break down sobbing as her knees can no longer support her. The girls each spread their wings and surround her in a very warm group hug all their friend to cry out her pain. After a couple more minutes, her crying dies down."Hey, can we all agree that those Orcs sure didn't see that ass whoopin coming?", Sylvia spoke eliciting hearty chuckles among Scarlett and the rest....The next day..."Ok, my turn.", Sylvia spoke as she along with the others peered over the edge of a rooftop down below at the different humans and liminals getting off work for the evening. Sylvia spots a guy in a business suit walking by looking through papers. She waves her finger creating a small blue magic seal that sends a gust of wind upwards and blows all his papers around."Pffft, hahahaha", Sharon and rest chuckle heartily as the man frantically tries to grab every paper."Oh, waitwaitwait, watch this!", Hana giggles spotting a blonde female Elf on her phone near the bus stop. Hana creates a small blue magic seal enchanting one of the papers. The man desperately chases it with the stack of paper under his arm. It reaches the Elfs feet forcing him to bend down and reach only for it to jerk upwards lifting the Elfs skirt up making her yelp in surprise. She turns to the man as he gives an embarrassed before getting layed out by a right hook. The Elf huffs as the man lay sprawled on the ground people walking around or over him. Hana and the girls laugh uncontrollably some rolling around holding their sides.Sharon looks and sees Scarlett laughing heartily with the most genuine she seen on her in a long time. Girls night out: success.
  
    Chapter Text
    The rest of Caleb and Lyca date went along pretty well. The pair managed to hike about halfway up the trail. Soon, they decided to take a short break at one of the rest areas. The rough ascent up the trail having worn them out a bit, by 'them' meaning mostly Caleb. They were the only ones there so they chose a picnic table closes in the shade. He bought them a couple of popsicles from a vending machine near them.Caleb's eye twitches as he sat unable to pry his eyes fixated on the sight before him while holding his root beer popsicle(closest thing to Dr. Pepper). Lyca sat across him enjoying her orange pop. Really enjoying it. Her tongue laps at the tip tentatively and she repeatedly and suggestively bobs her head up and down shaft the popsicle. All the while she steals longing glances at him making his cheek heat up intensely. He feels a knot in his stomach as she slowly licks the pop from base to tip. A gentle breeze blew around them, and with it, a faint sound.'Very good, maintain eye contact. Now take the whole thing in again.', came Zwei's voice in the wind making Lyca's ear twitch as she did as instructed proceeding to deep throat the ice pop and fighting the urge to bite.Caleb remains unnerved slightly and shifting his gaze. What is she doing? Typically, she would have gobbled up that popsicle by now but the way she's eating it now feels...deliberately sexual.In fact, he's noticed Lyca has been acting very strangely since they began their trek along the trail. First there were the odd comments she gave him ranging disjointed flirting to just slightly perverted comments. Then things got...weirder....There was the thing with the birds nest...'Huh, you know I always wondered how birds could sit on their eggs for so long without putting too much pressure on each of them.', Caleb says taking pictures of the blue jay in the nest.'I don't know Chief.', Lyca utters pressing her shoulder to his as her ear twitched, 'I guess some girls are just good at sitting on hard things. ~Maybe I can give you a demonstration sometime~?", Lyca spoke seductively touching a claw to her lip touching her hip to his. Caleb nearly drops his phones with a confounded expression..Then there was thing up the hill...Caleb pants as he truges up the rough upward trail while lamenting how out of shape he is. Suddenly, Lyca bounds beside and quickly passing him on all fours. She turns to him with a snarky grin.'Come Chief, this hill is nothin. ~Get to the top and later we'll show do something will really tire you out~', Lyca says continuing upwards on all fours giving Caleb an eyefull of daisy dukes. Caleb jaw drops in disbelief before he loses concentration nearly falls backwards.And the thing at the lake...'Wow, the water looks so clear and pretty!', Lyca spoke looking at her reflection with a bright smile.'Heh, yeah. Almost make me wish I knew how to fish. Then again, I guess that's not the most engaging thing to do on a date.', Caleb said rubbing his scalp with a chuckle.Lyca's ears twitch again before turning to Caleb, '~That's fine. I know something REALLY fun we could do instead~''Heh really what thaaaAAAAAAA WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!", Caleb shouted seeing Lyca's perky red nipples out with her twirling her crop top on her finger."Gettin' ready to go skinny dipping of course. Come on, join me.", Lyca spoke happily a unfastening her pants button the unzipping them."ARE YOU-NO nonononono we are NOT doing that!", Caleb protests with a flustered blush."~Why?~", Lyca inquires with a innocent pout."For a number of reason actually,, one of which being I don't know how to swim!", Caleb stated trying to make her cover her herself."~That's fine. I can do the doggy paddle for both of us. All you gotta do is get up there you mad dog.~", Lyca spoke in a disjointed seductive voice.Caleb gave a profoundly confused look, "...WHAT?!""Hey look mommy!", came the voice of a small child. Caleb turned to the sound and instantly felt pale upon seeing a family of five; a husband, a wife, two small boy, and a teenage girl staring at them in shock and interest. The woman cover the smaller children eyes while the teenage took out her phone pointing it at Caleb and the dad dialed someone on his phone."SHIIIAAT!", Caleb shouted before scooping Lyca off her feet eliciting a surprised yelp then sprinting off with her as the teenage snapped some pictures on her phone....As if the flirting was strange enough, it also seems she's trying to attract more attention to her physical assets. While he's grown used to Lyca showing him physical displays of affection; hugs, head nudges, even the occasional licking. Today is a different story. At some points she'd be determined to keep ahead of him, but not go too far, and jog in a way that allowed a good view of her tight bouncing butt and legs. Then when they had to cross a small bridge, she clung to his back for 'safety', despite the bridge clearly being large enough for both of them, pressing her body firmly into him even mushing her A-cup breasts into him. All while whispering stuff like, 'I'm glad this big, strong, handsome gentleman is here to help me', or 'I wonder if you taste as good as you smell.'. She'd even stop randomly to bend over giving him a good look at her daisy dukes. It's been very stressful for Caleb.Lyca swallows the popsicle wholes, shivering slight at the sudden chill through her body, leaving only the stick which she nibbles only with a satisfied smirkDelicious.", She says in a predatory tone eyeing him. Caleb cheeks burn intensely and he feels his heart race a mile a minute. It hasn't STOPPED racing since he got there. At this time, he decided he needed to get to the bottom of why Lyca is acting so...like this. Seriously, if not, he's not sure which will give him heart attack first; the exercise, the excitement or both?"OK, Lyca, we need to-", Caleb started but is cut off when, to his unawares, his half melted popsicle slides off it's stem landing right on his hand covering it in sticky juice, "Gah, awwww dammit", Caleb shakes hand trying to get it off then looks for something to wipe hand. Lyca's ears twitch again as another gentle breeze blows over."Hang on, I need to go wash my-", Caleb says getting up from his seat only for Lyca to stop him in his tracks grabbing his hand."That's alright Chief. Let me help you with that.", She says with a wink before happily lapping his hand. Caleb tenses up at the strange sensation of her course tongue getting every square inch of his hand with the excitement of a puppy licking it owner's palms. Caleb jaw drops when she takes his index finger and begin sucking on it. Her amber eyes staring at him with pure adoration and trust that could melt any man's heart. Caleb gulps before quickly pulling back retrieving his hand much to Lyca's confusion."What is goin' on with you?!", he stated keeps his saliva covered hand steady and away from him."Uhhh...whaddaya mean Chief?", Lyca shrugs innocently, "I just wanted help clean you up...and maybe get a taste of your ice pop. Two birds and whatnot.""THAT, that right there! What's up with all the double entendres? Why are you talking like a Steve Harvey dating book(yes, he exists in this universe BC wtfn?)?! Why are you being all... like this?!", Caleb approaches her and gingerly places a hand on her shoulder, "What's going on Lyca? You don't seem like...yourself right now. You seem...I don't know...like you're forcing yourself or something."Lyca goes silent unsure of what to say. Her ears twitch as a gentle breeze blows but she still remains silent in thought. They droop to the sides of her head as she casts her gaze downwards."Chief...I...", She utters before Caleb takes his hand from her shoulder. She looks up at him worried she did something wrong before silent."It's ok.", Caleb says with a sigh, "I'll give you minute to collect your thoughts while I go use the restroom real quick( and wash my hands the right way). When I come out, I expect some answers alright?", Caleb stated before gently patting her head making her coo softly." O-Ok", Lyca says before he goes to the nearby restroom closing the door behind him. Lyca plops down near one of the picnic tables and sighs. A light breeze kicks up and Zwei appears in front of her."Hey, what was that? You were supposed to say 'everything's cool Chief, I just couldn't help myself when you taste so good.' ", Zwei spoke in a sultry voice before seeing Lyca's conflicted demeanor, " Hey, what's wrong Lycs?""Zwei...I don't think I wanna do this anymore.", Lyca says looking down at her lap as she gently brushes her tail." Huh? What do you mean?! You're doing great!", Zwei replied disbelief."But...Chief hasn't returned any of my advances this whole trip. I-I think he might even be mad at me", Lyca replied slumping her shoulders feeling inadequate.Zwei sits on the table crossing one leg over the other as Drei soon appears as well leaping down from the roof of the rest area."Come on, you know that's not true. The guy's just too polite to make the first move so you've gotta GET him to. Help bring out the primal nature all men have. Keep flirting, boosting his ego a bit, giving him what he wants, then give a little touchy touch and he'll be your man.", Zwei stated assuredly."I think you just described a 'Chad' in his natural habitat.", Drei stated, "You two realize that enticing someone into sexual assault is not considered an ideal date. In fact, from what I've observed, he seems a tad put off by her 'extreme thirst' routine."Lyca shoots a worried look as Zwei quickly rebutted, "Whaaa? No, I'm telling ya he's just being shy. You seen how flustered he's been getting. Lyc's charm is melting his heart like butter on a fryer pan. Trust me, he loves flirty Lyca.""No, he LOVES Lyca.", Drei stated earning a surprised from the two of them, "Look, and I know this really cliche and subjective, but maybe she just be her usual energetic, loving, and honest self around him instead of this false standard we, by 'we' I mean 'you', put in her head and stop putting words in her mouth."Lyca thinks to herself for a moment while, unknown to them, the door to the men's rest room was slightly cracked open."W-Well what if you're wrong?! What if this IS what he likes? You don't know what guys find attractive in women!", Zwei stated with an annoyed huff."Maybe, but I know 'Me-Too' goes both ways.", Drei then turns Lyca, "knock off the Amber Tamblyns routine and just be open and honest with him.""Hey! I'm the-!", Zwei stated before being cut off by the sound of the restroom door opening. Zwei and Drei quickly vanish with a slightly breeze and Caleb steps out humming a song. He approaches Lyca who quickly raises to her feet ready to greet him."Huh, suuuuure is windy out today.", Caleb stated in an almost knowing tone, "So you ready to go?"Lyca gives a confused glance, "Wait, don't you want to explain myself?"Suddenly, voices could be heard in the distance. Caleb glances behind him at the trail and his blood goes cold. It was the family from before! Of course, so as not to panic, again, he turns to Lyca and politely says."O-f course I do...I just wanna...do it somewhere a bit more private.", Caleb says gesturing to small human family approaching the rest area consisting of 2 small boys, a female teen, and the couple. Lyca feels Caleb lightly grabbing her hand. He give her a warm smile, "Come on, let's bounce before they start taking adorable group pictures of you( and attempting to blacklist me for sexual harassment.)Lyca grins back at him and follows along side him to their next destination.Zwei and Drei watched the two of them from above the trees. Drei looks to her sister who was very conflicted expression."I think it's best we let her take it from here. At the end of the day, they both need to fall in love naturally.", Drei said.Zwei doesn't respond choosing glance away with a slight a scowl. Dre sighs standing up."Listen, you've done a good job making this date more interesting than it otherwise would've been but I think maybe I should take over now while you survey the ar-""NO!", Zwei shouted shooting to her feet. Below them, the family looks around to where the voice came from. Zwei turns to Drei who gave her a dry look and speaks in a quieter tone, "I've got this, OK sis? This is still MY mission, they're MY responsibility and I'm going to complete it.", Zwei stated before leaping through tree with blinding speed kicking up a gust of wind"WHOA LOOK MOM IT'S A FLYING SQUIRREL!", Shouted one of the little boys below.Drei gives a ponderous look, "You're not even considering what THEY want though. They're not NPCs on an escort mission...mostly.", Drei says before stealthily vanishing with the breeze to continue her recon.Caleb and Lyca continued their trek up the trail before arriving at their destination. It was a mid-sized clearing overlooking the lake and trail below. A single bench was placed near the center of the clearing. Lyca pressed against the gaurd railing looking around enjoying the pleasant view. Caleb looks around taking in the serene atmosphere as well."You know, it's views like this that remind you just how big the world is. It's a humbling feeling, you know?", Caleb says."Yeah, it makes you feel free.", Lyca replies closing her eyes in bliss. At that moment, Zwei arrives hiding among the treetops quietly observing them. She raises her hand tempted to use her Voice of the Wind but hesitates."Lyca?", Caleb started as Lyca look at him expectantly, "I know about what's been going on. I know you've been doing what Zwei told you to try seducing me."Lyca and Zwei simultaneously tenses up their tails standing erect realizing they'd been caught."W-W-Whaa? How did you figure it out?!", Lyca stated incredulously."Honestly, I had my suspicions that SOMETHING was up but I might've eavesdropped on you guys from the restroom.", Caleb admitted."Huh? But I was listening, I wouldn't heard you at the door!", Lyca stated as Zwei gives an equally confused look unsure how she couldn't sense his presence."I...don't know but sorry doing tha-No, actually, I'm NOT sorry! Explain!", Caleb demanded.Lyca blushes in embarassment, "I...I...I wanted to close to you like Mira is!", she blurted out plainlyCaleb was taken aback by her declaration as Zwei looked already knowing what she meant."What? What are you talking about? We are close...aren't we?""Yeah but...it's not the same. You always light up whenever you see her or talk to her. Whenever you two are together, the scent of your hormones fill the room. It's the same whenever you and Cami are together too. They way you look at them...is just like how my old Alpha looked at his Alpha female.", Lyca spoke somberly, " I-I know you like me Chief, I see how you look at me. I just want...you look at me the way you look at Mira and Cami""Lyca...", Caleb uttered softly."I wanted to be a good mate but...I'm not good with words and I don't know anything about dates. Zwei offered to help me show you what I have to offer. I wanted...to show you I could be attractive...just like them. I want you to see me the same way Cheif! I want you to love me the same way!", Lyca spoke with unbridled passion in her voice and genuine longing in her gaze as she places her hands to his chest. Her ears flatten against her head, tail tucks between her legs, and lays her forehead to his chest, " I-I'm sorry for ruining our date. I...I just wanted... ", Lyca utters as Zwei frowns seeing her friend so despondent.Caleb stood crossing his arm in thought at her confession. He felt a bit ashamed at ignoring her feelings towards him. His mind drifts back to when he first announced his and Moon Pie's relationship. Who knows bad Lyca must've felt; she could've just been putting on a brave face up until now. He knew in his heart he had to make this right."Lyca.", Caleb spoke plainly."Yes Chief?", Lyca looks up and Caleb flicks her forehead, "Owww!", Lyca yelps holding rubbing forehead. Zwei's eyes widen in surprise."THAT was for believing you had to do all that crap just for my attention."Caleb then immediately pulls her into a tight, warm hug eliciting a surprised yelp from the she-wolf. He releases her pets the top of her head as she look up at him curiously, " Look, nothing is ruined Lyca. This is partly my fault for being insensitive to how you felt towards me. However, you've got it wrong."Lyca gives a worried look as Zwei pauses in anticipation."Because...I already think you're attractive!", Caleb stated earning a surprised stare from Lyca and Zwei, " Each of you have traits I admire, and you are no exception. You're honest, playful, fun to be around, you've got this infectious energy, and you're one of the hardest workers I've ever seen. Hell, when I first met you a couple months ago, you were skinny and lean now you're like a werewolf Ronda Rousey! That's an accomplishment! Be proud!", Caleb says as Lyca blushes. While she didn't know who Wanda Rosey was, she was still happy he acknowledged how much she's changed in terms of strength. It helped even more to finally hear it out loud. Lyca gives a small grin glancing away with an air of uncertainty around her. Caleb sighs softly realizing he's gonna have show more initiative if he's going to put her doubts at ease."You know, they way you keep yourself in such great shape without starving yourself, is awesome and all but the results speak for themselves. You're..a very sexy girl, Lyca.", Caleb stated feeling a bit awkward saying that.Lyca shoots a surprised but delighted gaze at him while Zwei's mouth drops at his statement."Cheif! Y-You think I'm...sexy?! Me?!", Lyca says a smile forming and tail starting to wag excitedly while staring with twinkling amber eyes.Caleb scatches his head in embarassment, "Well...yeah! Of course, I mean, you were pretty before but now you're REALLY something.""W-What about me is sexy?!", she inquires stepping closer to him with anxious smile.Caleb inhales realizing he's passed the point of no return, "Well...your thighs for one.""My thighs?", Lyca spoke tilting her head then look down at her legs. Caleb sighs internally at how unrepentantly innocent this girl was and how much it was melting his heart. Zwei snickers in the background becoming fixated on just how good things were getting."Y-yeah, they're so...muscular, lean and...uh plump.", Caleb slightly cringes at what he was saying but Lyca simply blushes in delight. Caleb swallows and continues, "I think your abs are pretty sexy too. Your eyes are beautiful, your fur is soft, and your ears and tail are cute", Caleb spat out trying to get it over with.Lyca presses her head to his chest making Caleb look down in surprise. She softly presses herself against him wrapping her arms around him. She look up him grinning with unbridled admiration. Caleb's heart skips a beat."I love you Chief. Thank you for saying all that. I needed it. And...I think you have a really strong body too.", Lyca spoke in an uncommonly soft tone. Caleb felt the warmth radiating off her. Though she's...been in contact with him throughout the day now it felt...genuinely sweet. Inviting even. He hugs her back holding her tight against his chest as Lyca relaxes in his embrace taking in his scent and the feel of his muscles. Caleb then begins gently petting the soft canine ears he loved so much while she cooed at his touch. Her tails wraps around his waist."I love you too.", he whispered in her ear. Her eyes widen before tears begin forming as the words reverberated in her head. She pulls off his chest and look up at him longingly her eyes glazed with desire and lips parted as she inches closer. Caleb hesitates at first, thoughts of Mirabelle flooding his mind. He then mentally slaps himself. No. This is fine! Moon Pie is fine with this. Otherwise, she never would have allowed the date to happen in the first place. As he looked back at the awaiting girl before him, he realizes how much he's denied how beautiful she was. How sincere her feelings, and how open about her love for him she was. He caresses the side of Lyca's face. He leans in prepared to show how open he was going to be. The second their lips touch, Lyca's eyes shoot open in surprise at the soft, tingly sensation and pleasant taste of her Chief's lips. Caleb noted a rather robust yet earthy taste on her lips. It was...pleasant and quite inviting. They seperate for a moment with Lyca staring and touching her lip in fascination."Heh, guess...that's the first we kissed.", Caleb giggles as Lyca nods with a blank daze. Caleb notices he stunned, pensives expression, "Uhhh, Lyca, hun. You al-WAH!", he elicted as Lyca jumps him wrapping her arms around his neck while furiously licking at his lips and face. Zwei facepalms herself at how much Lyca was forgetting her training. Caleb could feel her press harder into him as she instinctively grinds her groin against his. Caleb forces her to stop wiping to saliva from his mouth; he wanted to regain control and teach her slowly. He caresses her face as she pants with rosey cheeks in anticipation. Caleb leans in and kisses her passionately forcing the She-wolf to pauses before melting into it. Their lips smack together in a sweet display pent up desire.Lyca sighs enjoying this form of licking. She pokes her tongue out again to which Caleb captures and begins Frenching her to Lyca's shock. This sensation being new to her, Lyca mostly followed his lead exploring her chiefs mouth with her tongue enjoying how good he tasted.Zwei watched in amazement. It worked! It actually worked! She fistpumps victorious at completing this personal mission of hers. She felt proud of herself, also for Lyca, but mostly herself.The two gasp and pull away for air panting. Lyca stared with dilated pupils putting like a dog tail wagging excitedly and smiling him. Caleb chuckles to himself at just how cute she was. He was feeling a bit more sure of himself now."H-Hey Chief?", Lyca mutters."Yeah?"Lyca sways her body touching clasping her hands behind her back, "A-Are we gonna do...sexy stuff now?"Zwei ceases her celebration and turns back the pair. Caleb's braind momentarily leaves the room to scream before returning back to seat, "Come again?""W-Well...I said I wanted you to love me the same way. I know you and Mira do sexy stuff...I wanna do it too.", Lyca spoke blushing heavily.Caleb inhales trying calm down his racing heart, "*clears throat*, Lyca, sweety, what exactly...do you think "sexy stuff" is?"Lyca ears perk up, "Oh, Zwei told me actually.", she spoke as Zwei herself tenses up with an 'uh oh' expression, "Stuff like foreplay or butt stuff or...something called 'karma sutra' with all these... weird pictures of people in a book. Oh and stuff like handjobs, footjobs, blowjobs, thighjobs, there's allotta jobs. We even practiced some of it."Zwei was sweating nervously trying to keep her composure. Caleb stood silent just...taking all that in. Somehow, this is worse than Moon Pie's 'how-to sex' book."Alrighty...I'm gonna have talk with her later. That is if she isn't ALREADY LISTENING, in which case, WHAT THE FUCK?!", Caleb stated making Zwei cringe even more trembling like a scolded child."Y-You're not mad at her are you? She was only trying help me.", Lyca asks in a worried tone."I...Imma have to get back to you on that. Right now, back to us! I want you to forget that stuff( for now) and tell me what you want me to do...t-to you?", Caleb stated. Zwei ears perk up and she turns back to them peeking around the tree branches."Oh...um...I like what you said about my thighs so...do you...want to touch them?"Caleb mentally screams then bitchslaps himself. He told himself it was fine, Moon pie would be fine with this. Maybe. God he hoped so. He clears his throat and focuses on NOT stuttering like a jackass, "Yes."Lyca smiles excitedly tail wagging while Zwei blushes lightly spazzing like a fan girl trying to contain herself."Hehehe Yay!", Lyca exclaims as Caleb beckons her over to a nearby bench. He sits down as stands inches in front of. He looks her up and down from black fur covered lower legs past her toned to her anxious grin look down at him. She reaches and strokes her padded clawed hand around his head urging him to begin. He reaches up touching both hands to her fur gently strokiing her as she sighs contently. She pets him wanting him to continue.***Lemony Content inbound***The She-wolf shudders as Caleb glides his hands up to her smooth, muscular thighs. Caleb marvelling at their firmness and gives a light squeeze eliciting a low yelp from her. He continues his caresses, steadily becoming more at ease with the scenario. He lays his forehead to her firm abs as Lyca shudders when his wonderful hands glide across her tight but plump rear gently groping her flesh. He makes a bold move and grabs two handfuls of her firm butt cheeks and massaging them. Lyca gasps and moans in delight as his claws dig into her flesh like a carnivore. She felts a heat build in her lower region along with a dampness she never felt before."~Haaa...Haaa...chief, that feels good.~", Lyca moans as her breathing grows heavier, "H-How ahhh do they feel to you?""They feel great Lyca. Your muscles are so firm. Calling you healthy does you no justice.", Caleb spoke his mouth dry as a cracker as he groped her tender but firm flesh. He moves his hands from her butt tracing along her thighs as she moans in content. Caleb takes another bold step and glides his hand to her inner thigh brushing against her lower region."~Haaaaaaaaaaa! C-Chief, I-I'm really sensitive there! Haaa but please keep going it feels soooo gooood.~", Lyca panted as her heart pounded before putting her foot on the bench leaning towards. Caleb leans forward kisses her abs. Lyca yips then moan at the sensation grabbing his head and hold it to her tummy. Seeing she likes it, Caleb starts kissing her while continuing to lovingly caress her thighs. Lyca moans grow louder the more he stimulated her. She never got to experience anything like this in her old pack. Mostly because she was such a weakling the Alpha never would have chosen her among the other females. It THIS what she was missing? Or perhaps HER chief actually better?! She didn't know and frankly couldn't care less. Right now, she only knows one thing: her Alpha loves her.The heated wetness in her loins grows as her breathing grows more ragged. Caleb couldn't help becoming more and infatuated with this. Every touch, every movement felt electric. He never imagined feeling something like this with anyone other than Moon Pie. It was still a strange feeling but then again, so we're his feelings toward MOON pie at first.Zwei just watches them awkwardly. Looks like her plan worked better than she thought. Perhaps, too well.'Hehe, I guess...things worked out. I should let them take it from here heh', she thought feeling she should look away and give them they're privacy. She turns back about to...go do her body guarding further away. She then hears Lyca moan louder, her tail stood erect as her blush deepens.'Orrrrr...maybe I should stick around a bit longer. I-it's my job to...uh...make sure they're...safe and stuff. It's my job.', Zwei tells herself before peaking through the branches again."Haaannnnn...C-Chief, I-I wanna haaaaa try something else.", Lyca moaned.Caleb ceases all movement and looks up at her, "Ok...w-what do you want me to uhhh..."Lyca answers by adjusting her position with Caleb removing his hands. To Caleb's( and Zwei's) surprise she lifts herself up straddling his waist. Caleb shudders feeling her groin touch his hardened member. Despite having on cargo shorts, he still feel it's shape through her cutoff jean shorts. Caleb was struck speechless when she pulled down her camo crop to her midsection exposing her bare breasts. Even though he, technically saw them before, albeit under lesser favorable conditions, this time is different. Now he can really see them. Her nipples were light brown and stiff and, despite being A-cups, they perky with a slight roundness to them. Caleb thought they suited her actually; simple but adorable."D-Do you like them, Chief?", Lyca utters sheepishly puffing out her chest s bit, "T-They're not as big as Cami or Mira's... but..."Caleb could see the insecurity in her eyes. Living with moon pie has given him him a sixth sense for that kind of thing. He closes his inhaling in preparation for what he was about to do next. He leans forward and tenderly kisses her breast. Lyca gasps at the action staring at him in surprise. Zwei covers get mouth to muffle her gushing."They're perfect.", Caleb assured looking her the eyes. Lyca smiles her heart pounding in absolute joy. She wraps her arms around him and they share another passionate kiss. Her chest presses against him with nipples scraping against his shirt. Caleb lightly moans at the sensation rubbing her back.Zwei bites her lower lips a deep blush across her cheeks and heart racing while she tries in vain to keep her composure.Lyca pulls away panting heavily with bright red cheeks and eyes full of lust, "Chief, I'm ready! I WANT you to take me!", she spoke grinding herself against Caleb's bulge.Zwei muffled her scream with her hands. She internally debates herself. While she felt it was her job to stop things now, a bigger part of her said otherwise. Luckily, Caleb beats her to it."N-NO!", Caleb stated making Lyca flinch then pull back worried she did something wrong. Caleb sees this and corrects himself, "I mean, no, Lyca we can't do that.""Why? I love you! And you love me! And Sterling already knows about all of us!", Lyca debated."Yeah, b-but listen, HE may know but the rest of ICEP doesn't. Humans and Liminals mating is STILL illegal and we still could be arrested or deported. I don't want that and neither do you. I do love but we can't risk it, ok? I told Moon Pie the same thing.", Caleb assured gently stroking her ears."O-Ok. I understand.", Lyca replied in disappointment. Zwei sighs in both relief and disappointment. Caleb sees the hurt in her eyes and quickly resolves to validate her deep feeling for him."I'm not done. There ARE other ways to show our affection. Ones where ICEP can't find out we really did anything.", Caleb smirks raising an eyebrow.Lyca tilts her head, "Like whaaahaaaaaa", Lyca elicits in surprise as Caleb begin his middle and index fingers along the shape of her womanhood. If Zwei was drinking something, she would have done spit take right now.'Holy shit! Is he really gonna...', Zwei thought making an 'oh my' face.Lyca moans and trembles as Caleb continues to mess with her loins. He whispers in her ear."This, Lyca honey, is "foreplay" ", He says before gently nibbling her ear causing her to hug his neck tighter."Haaaa I-I like it! Show me more!", Lyca moaned happily. Caleb obliged stroking her through her pants then caressing her thigh to her lower back. His hand reaches the base of her tail and he gets an idea based on the experience with Camilla on the full moon. He grabs it an experimental pull." HAAAAAAAAA NOT MY TAIL!", Lyca shouted to the sky arching her back in pleasure as Caleb pulls it harder sending more waves of pleasure up her spinal cord, "~Ahhh it kinda hurts but I love iiiiit!~, She moans into Caleb's ear.Zwei is up in trees breathing heavily. She leans against the trunk of the tree massaging breast and playing with her now moist loins , " ~O-Oh shit, haaa... this is...this is kinda hot.~", She giggles and moans slovenly as her hand pinches her hardened nipple making her tense up gritting her teeth. She refocuses on the pair.As Lyca's moans on pleasure fill the area, Caleb feels his arms starting to cramp and gets another idea. He releases her an stops stroking her much to her confusion."Ok, Lyca, I need ya to turn around.", Caleb asks. Lyca was puzzled but does as she was told and stands up then sits on his lap with her back to him. She yelps at something hard poke her butt before Caleb moves her up a bit more so she could see his bulge between her thighs. Her tail hangs off to the side, "Ok, now just bare with me, cuz I don't know what the hell I'm doing.", Caleb spoke honestly."What do you mean? I think you're doing great! ", Lyca turned to him with a trusting smile. Caleb smiled back at her encouragement. He glides hand over her abs before squeezing and caressing her breath. Lyca moans and trembles in delight resting her head in the crook of his neck. He then drifts his other hands between her legs eliciting a sharp moan as her thighs close around his hand. He winces a bit but starts moving his fingers churning the juices that had built up in her loins. The wet, sloven sounds it made as he played with her love canal ignited the dormant lust within the she-wolf."*pant pant* Oh Gods! Ahhhh this feels...incredible Chief! Harder! Faster! More harder!", Lyca pants instinctively and simple-mindedly undulating her hips seeking more pleasure. Caleb complies speeding up his pace. His fingers prodded her entrance as her love juices soaked through her shorts and sounds of wetness came with each move he made. He played with her hardened nipples: twisting, pinching, and pulling them experimentally. Soon he had a bit of a rhythm going all while the She-wolf was practically bursting at the seems squirming and moans lustfully. Lyca eyes roll upwards in ecstasy with her tongue hanging from her mouth panting laboriously.Zwei is breathing erratically as she continues to fondle herself. Her love juices soaking her spandex and hardened nipples protruding through the spandex. In the back of her mind, silently hoping Drei wouldn't show up.Lyca opens her legs allowing Caleb better access; to his relief. She then reaches down Caleb and begins stroking Caleb's crotch make him shudder."L-Lyca.""I...haaa...I wanna see it at least...haaa I wanna make you feel good too.", Lyca spoke with a delirious gaze.Caleb hesitates for a moment telling himself it was ok. He nods with a gulp ceasing his caresses for a moment as Lyca unzips him. She pushes the cloth away allowing his member to spring out before her. Her eyes widen at the sight of it as it being her first time seeing. The musky scent rafting from his loins putting her in a daze and stirring the primal instincts within her. She reaches down a curiously touches it with her furry, padded fingers making Caleb sigh contently. She thinks back to her "training" with Zwei and the cucumber and wraps her fingers around the base before slowly stroking up and down eliciting moans from Caleb. She grins in satisfaction and begins picking up her pace. The sensation of fur-covered clawed fingers with thick but smooth canine pads for palms felt strangely more pleasant than He would have guessed."Haaa...am I...doing it right, Chief?", Lyca looks back at him continuing to vigorously stroke him off." ack...you're haaaa doing great Lyca! Your paws feel amazing!",, Caleb uttered blissfully as Lyca smiles proud herself at being able to make him so happy. Caleb, not wanting to leave things unfinished, proceeds to unbutton her shorts. The she-wolf gasps as he unzips her."C-Chief, what are-HYAAAHHHHHHHH HHAAA", Lyca moans loudly throwing her head back over his shoulder as his middle and index finger enter her soaking wet pussy. Lyca soon recovers before resuming stroking off her beloved Chief. Her hot, pulsating walls of flesh enraptured his fingers and contorted welcomingly leaving his palm soaked in pleasure nectar. Lyca pants erratically feeling light-headed and vision clouded with pure joy."~Chief! Chief! Haaaaa...I feel...something...something big is coming!", Lyca spoke disjointedly as she strokes his shaft more rapidly."Me too, Lyca! Haaaaa me too! Ahh don't stop now!", Caleb moans through ragged breath feeling his limit quickly approach while fingering her more intensely. A gentle breeze blows past them.Zwei sat with her back against the tree masturbating roughly as her Voice of the Wind carried their voices to her ears, "~Yeah don't you dare stop! Haaa you like that doggy pussy don't cha? Don't cha?! Haaaa!", she moans lustfully before clenching her emitting a low weasel growl."Chief! CHIEF! I CAN'T...erk...HAAAHHHHHNNNNNHH!" "Lyc-AHHHAA!""Hhhnnngghhh!", Zwei elicits clenching her teeth as she came in her spandex.Lyca exclaims loudly as her orgasm hits hard making her arch her back and soaking Caleb's hand and her shorts in her juices. Caleb follows her as he fires his load right into her palm and onto to grass. Lyca goes limp leaning against the two tried to catch their breath bathing in the afterglow.***Lemon Cake***Caleb removes his hand feeling how incredibly wet and viscousy it felt. It takes a moment before he fully realizes what he just did and he begins to question if this truly was OK. He knew the answer but something that said otherwise kept nagging in the back of his mind. Suddenly, Lyca nuzzles and licks the crook of his neck bringing him from his thoughts. Lyca raises up making eye contact and Caleb saw the look of pure, unconditional love filled gaze and rosy cheeks."That was amazing! I've never felt anything that good...EVER! I'm glad I could share it with you Chief.", Lyca chirped with starry eyes.Caleb couldn't help giving a small grin, "Hehe, yeah, I'm...glad too."Lyca then notices the sticky sensation on her palm. She look at her hand and sees her hand covered in white blotches of Caleb's load."Whooaaa so much came out", Lyca spoke looking at her hand in amazement and curiousity to Caleb's slight embarassment."Uhhh, yeah I can...say the same to you.", Caleb showed his drenched hand before wiping the back of his hand on the armrest.The curious scent pulling her in, Lyca licks a bit from her finger as Caleb gives a slightly purturbed look.Lyca's eyes widen at taste; a faint amber glow in her eyes. "Wow! This tastes great!" She stated before proceeding to greedily lick off the rest.Caleb gives a weirded out look unsure of how to respond to that. She licks her hand clean sighing in satisfaction."How do I taste Chief?! Go on try it", Lyca inquires facing him with an excited expression eyes darting to his hand. Caleb looks at his hand then back to her with a very confused look and grossed out look."Why?!", he stated."Please?", Lyca pleaded with a saddened look ears pointing down. Caleb closes his eyes and sighs. Curse those puppy eyes.'Fuck it.', he thought before reluctantly raising his hand to his lips then giving a small lick. Caleb's eyes widen at the surprising sweetness that enveloped his tongue. He feels his entire body pulsate for a moment as his eyes flash a glint of purple. He looks to Lyca and gives a small grin, "You taste...really sweet. Not that surprisingly really, I guess.."Lyca smiles happily tail wagging, "That makes me really happy!", she spoke in a chipper tone as Caleb blushes slightly in embarassment proceeding to discretely wiping his palm on the bench planks. Caleb asks to move off him so he can zip up his pant. She does so following his lead then fixing her topUp in the trees, Zwei resumed observing them, after having recovered from the afterglow of HER orgasm, with a satisfied grin. Her cheeks were still a bit flushed and the crotch of her spandex were now completely damp, she couldn't be more proud of herself...and Lyca."First solo mission accomplished.", She in a cocky tone, "Lycs got her man and...I just discovered a voyuerist fetish. Win-Win!", Zwei spoke to herself before a smile began to fade.'Then again, she only got this far when I didn't do anything. Was I really just holding her back the whole time? *sigh* guess Drei and Ein were right...as usual.', Zwei thought as her shoulders started to slump. Suddenly, her ears twitch to the sound of rustling below her. She looks down and sees a figure lurking behind the growth crouched down. They had large pointed canine ears and long bushy tail. They glared intently at the couple and prepared to lunge themselves.Zwei doesn't waste any time and quickly extends her wrist scythes before raising them over head clanging them together. A breeze spreads out in an ever growing ring carrying a high-pitched sound wave with it. Lyca's and the unknown observer's ears perk up attentively giving a confused yipp....Elsewhere, Drei could be seen in the trees observing the behavior of some of the other hikers. None of them appeared to be a threat. She prepares to go check on how Zwei is doing when her ear perk up to the familiar sound of family's signature distress signal along with the breeze rustling the tree tops."The 'Beacon Draft'!", Drei she stated then leaps upward before creating an air bubble to launch herself forward going in the direction of the signal. She leaps from treetop to treetop at incredible speeds , "I'm coming."...Zwei lowers her arms hoping Drei wasn't too far away to hear it. She quickly turns her attention back to the intruder then lunges herself at then brandishing her scythes. She quickly closes in prepared to deliver a clean knockout. Then, to her shock, the intruder ducks their head then delivers a headbutt to the weasels stomach. Zwei goes tumbling to the ground in the open before recovering to her feet.Caleb and Lyca whips their heads around at the sudden noise."Oh good, just the girl I wanted to have a wor-", Caleb spoke in a sarcastic tone before Zwei interrupts."NO TIME, JUST RUN YOU TWO!", Zwei shouted. Before Caleb could speak any further a large canine liminal leaps out of the forest snarling and tackles Zwei."AHHHOHHH SHIT!", Caleb shouted in fear. Zwei gets pinned to the ground blocking bites wirh her scythes. Despite instinct telling him to get Lyca and run away, his legs just wouldn't budge. As he saw Zwei hold the Liminal away as it knashed it's fangs trying to bite into her, memories of the Hellhounds replayed over and over in his mind. His heart pounded rapidly as he began hyperventilating."YOU GET OFF HER!", Lyca snarled before tackling the canine liminal allowing Zwei to get to her feet. The two liminal rolled around in the dirt barking, snarling trying to bite at each other. Caleb eyes widen in horror as he slowly started to relive the night he almost lost Lyca once again. He had do something! Anything!The two liminals seperate from each others while remaining on all fours snarling and baring their fangs. Their assailant was a large female canine liminal with grey fur convering her arm to elbow and legs to her knees with splashes of white on their belly and bottom of their bushy tail. They had large pointed ears, bright blue eyes, and large white fangs. They wore grey hiking shorts with a black suspenders and a forest green top.Zwei brandishes her scythes coming to Lyca's side, "Stand down now! I'm with ICEP! Stand! Down!"The unknown liminal ignores glances at her then back to Lyca. She stares at Lyca intently taking in her scent before her expression melt into a sudden realization."L-Lyca...?", she spoke standing up straight.. Lyca's expression softens into one of surprise as Zwei gives a confused look, "Lyca...is that really you?"Lyca's sniffs at her before realization fills her face, "H-Hollo?", she says standing up straight as well. It was at this moment when it was shown that Hollo was at least a foot taller than Lyca and Zwei.Zwei looks back and forth between them questioningly.A wide smile slowly grows on Hill's face as Lyca follows suit."WAAAAAAAAAAA!", Lyca squeals happily before Hollo joins her then the two embrace laughingly ecstatically. Their tails wag energetically as the roll around hopping on each other and giving playful canine yipping.Caleb stands with a very bewildered expression trying to make sense of the situation, "Wha...this...I...fuckin...Huh?!", he uttered before turning to Zwei. She shrugs while shaking her head just as confused as him."Hollo! Hollo, are you over there?!", came another voice. Caleb and the rest turn to see a man walking up the trail. He was about 5'09", around late-20s medium brown skin, neck length black hair, wearing loose wrangler jeans, brown hiking boots, green V-neck shirt under brown suede leather jack, and some type necklace with a native American sygil of some kind. He actually looked to be of Native American descent. He carried a black backpack with water bottles on the sides."Hahaha I'm over here Mahkah!", Hollo called to the man, apparently named 'Mahkah'It's at that moment, two other Liminals appear from behind him. One, a male Inari with bright yellow fur cover his arms, legs, and two tail with splashes of white at the tips, green eyes, and pointed ears on top of his head. He looked around to be in his late teens, was a bit lanky and wore green cargo shorts with matching suspenders, forest green t-shirt with 'Nirvana' on it, and knee length black hiking boots. The other one was a female Kobold, who looked around her mid 20s, with light brown fur covering her whole body, a well-toned athletic physique, dark brown eyes, and slightly curled tail brown tail. Her attire was a pair of dark blue skin tight shorts, white tank top with sports bra underneath, brown hiking boots, and a blue belt collar with silver accent marks."See, I told you she was up here.", The kobold spoke folding her arms shaking her head, "I swear, she has the impulse control of a college frat boy.""Hey! Hollo, why did you just take off like that?! It's not safe for us to be too far from Big Bro! ", the male Inari added."Oh, sorry guys! I just caught the scent of something that smelled...familiar. Like someone I knew and turns out IT WAS LYCA!", Hollo exclaims going back to laughing an hugging Lyca who eagerly."O...K but still, they're right. You really shou-", Mahkah interuppted by Caleb."HEY! Hold up!", Caleb shouted getting everyone's attention, "Did I just step backwards into the fuckin' TARDIS or something!? Why did she attack us?! Who the fuck are all y'all?! Somebody better start explaining something before I really lose my shit!", he stated not even trying to be polite right now."What he said!", Zwei added."Attack you?", Mahkah turns to Hollo."Hey! I didn't attack you! SHE attacked me first!", Hollo stated pointing at Zwei."Because I saw you just standing there watching them...MENACINGLY. You don't understand his circumstance, as his ICEP bodyguard I can't be too careful!", Zwei defended herself."That doesn't give you the right to cut off someone's head!", Hollo protested glaring at Zwei."H-Hey wait a sec...", she utter trying to calm them both down only to be ignored."Wait, she what?!", Mahkah stated turning to Zwei. The other two liminals focus intently on her as well."Oh please, I wasn't going to. I was only gonna-", Zwei retorts before Caleb interjects."GETTING OFF TRACK!", Caleb shouted startling everyone before turning to Lyca, "Lyca, who is this girl? Do you know her?""Oh, of course I do! This is Hollo, Chief! We used to be pack mates together!", Lyca stated before leaning a shoulder against Hollo's who playfully returned the gesture, "In fact, we came from the same litter! We're sisters!"Caleb, Zwei and their other guests go silent in utter shock before they all simultaneously uttered the only logical phrase that felt warranted, "WHAT?!"Suddenly, Drei drops right in the middle of the group brandishing her small scythe in one arm and popping open a small vial, "I'm here! Where's the threat?", she spoke. Even turns their stunned gazes to Drei and she quickly picks up on the strange atmosphere, "Oh, Ok. I'M the weirdo."Mahkah steps up, "Ok, I think we all need to take a step back to clear all this up. So Mr...""Bizzell! Caleb Bizzell.", Caleb answered plainly starting to reign in his emotions."Mr. Bizzell, my wards and I have a campsite up ahead, why don't you all join us and relax? We have food and drinks if you want.", The man politely offered earning skeptical looks from the Inari and Kobold.Hollo and Lyca's tails wag excitedly at the mention of meat.Caleb pauses a moment thinking it over before answering, "Well...alright. We could use a breather( especially me with the stroke I just about had.)"Alright then! Just follow us.", The man spoke with a grin. Caleb picks up his blue bag slinging it around his shoulder. Caleb looks over to Drei and Zwei. Drei nods to him silently letting him know they had his back."Let's go Lyca.", Caleb says before following the mystery man and his wards."You too, Hollo!", Mahkah called out to his ward."Okay!", both werewolves answered their respective hosts before looking to each other and smiling.Mahkah turns to and starts walking with his wards following close behind. Caleb follows them being slightly wary of these strangers. Lyca and her sister follow happily walking next to each other as Zwei watches with a slightly hurt look. Hollo shoots a glare at the weasel making her tense up in surprise."So...mind filling me in?", Drei inquires to her sister."Well, Lycs confessed to the boss. It went well, wayyy better than thought it would.", Zwei stated."That explains the scent coming from the bench. Did they...","It was just foreplay.", Zwei quickly answered."Good. At least he's making progress.", Drei says as Zwei half-smiles glancing away in thought. Drei give her a quizzical look, "Also, why are your bottoms wet?"Zwei blushes red avoiding eye contact, "Uhhhhhhhh HEY! They'regettingtoofarawayletscatchup!", she spoke rapidly before zooming off after them leaving a trail of wind and kicking up dust.Drei swipes her arm blowing dust off her body then gives a puzzled look. She decided not to mention the pungent, hormone filled scent that radiated off her sister's body. She was embarrassed enough. For now.WRSUP FAM! Finals are finally over! Finally! Now, I'm still stuck in house just like millions of other Americans and now have even more time on my hands. I'm looking into some online work just for extra income and have been writing a lot. Ok, so, this chapter was meant to be WAYYYY longer but, in the interest of not overwhelming with too much information at once, I decide to break up Lyca's date into three parts. Will I do the same for Camilla? Possibly, depending how much detail I want to put in( it's alot). Stay tuned for when we check up on how Mirabelle and the others are doing. Ok, you guys again real soon, Peace fam.
  
    Chapter Text
    ****Meanwhile, at Mirabelle's group****Camilla sat picking at her second piece of cake eye twitching as she did her best to contain her irritation at her current position. Being forced to sit and listen to the human girls incessant prattle. It didn't help that Señora Mirabelle and the weasel were encouraging it."Ok ok, I get it but just hear me out. Just hear me out.", Cheryl stated to Ein gesturing with her palm."Alright, what is it?", Ein spoke passively giving in."Now, most mammalian liminals share genetic similarities with humans, that's been confirmed...by scientists...doing research on that stuff right?""Ok.", Ein nods as Mirabelle listens intently."So species like elves, trolls, dwarves, and even dullahan are most closely related to humans than other species. Their anatomy is very similar to ours meaning breeding between our races is rather easy, right?", Cheryl stated looking back and forth everyone.Ein, Mirabelle, and espescially Camilla give her a strange looks. Ein then speaks up, "Yes...""But, consider species like mermaids, lizardmen, lamia, hornets, Arachne, those...frog...people...waddaya call'em?", Cheryl gives a puzzled look snapping her fingers hoping to jog her memory."Bullywugs?", Ein inquires"Yeah! Anyway, these liminal species have more reptilian, bug-like, or amphibious characteristics right? And yet, they are all warm blooded, sweat when too hot, have hair, and are fully capable of breeding with humans as well. So, are THEY actually mammals? Or are they combination of mammal and non-mammal class? The latter of which is technically impossible because of modern taxonomy."Mirabelle and Ein gives genuinely puzzled look as the gears turned in their head. Camilla plaintively sips her coffee only half listening to human. If it was up to her, she'd have left by now but knew she couldn't risk being out without the weasel. Instead, she distracts herseld a bit looking off at the people below their viewpoint going about their business."Hmmm, that is a good question. I would have to say no. You have to consider the fact that, though the species you listed have some mammalian characteristics, they STILL retain characteristics familiar with other classes of animals. Ergo, Arachne getting intoxicated when ingesting caffeine or most reptilian, amphibious, or insectoid liminals being poikilothermic. It's more or less about compatibility bias.", Ein explained."Compatibility bias?", Mirabelle inquired"It's...sort of theory I heard of in Beijing developed by their ICEP researchers. To keep it brief, it proposes that liminals with non-mammalian characteristics are able to alter their sex organs to best suit the most prominent breeding partners that are available. Whatsmore, it's speculated this phenomenon can take place almost instantly without said liminal even realizing.", Ein explained before taking a bite of her cressant."Whoa, so you're saying that...if a female Arachne is in an environment where that are more male humans than male Arachne, then their reproductive organs will just...morph to be compatible to humans?", Cheryl stated with curious gaze. Mirabelle blushes a little with a ponderous expression."In essence, yes. It's even possible the reason it occurs in the first place is because the Liminal subconsciously chooses the most available male species to maximize a successful copulation. Hence, the name Compatibility BIAS.", Ein replied with a content expression."Huh, so its like a really, really helpful version of body dysmorphia...only with NONE of the negative stuff. I'm sold, sign me up. I am down with that.", Cheryl spoke raising her cup of jasmine tea with a chuckle. Mirabelle and Ein chuckle along with as Camilla rolls her eyes before turning up her cup."Haaa, yes I suppose that IS another way to put.", Ein spoke her giggles lettering out. Suddenly, a thought occurs to Mirabelle."Hmm, Ms. Ein, is possible the same idea applies to plant-based Liminals as well? ", she asks stirring her tea.Cheryl turn to Mirabelle with intrigue, "Ohhhh, I almost forgot about them! Yeah, do THEY count as some kind of mammal-plant hybrids like...ANY grass-type starter Pokemon or something?""I...I don't think so? However, I can assume the same applies.", Ein says touching her chin in thought."Peculiar. I've grown up around Dryads and I've never seen one with a swelled tummy. The babes just...sprout from their flowers on their bodies. If that weren't enough, the babes still need be nursed on a mums milk. Plus, I've never seen any MALE Dryads ever.", Mirabelles in a thoughtful tone before taking a bite of her cook-I mean biscuit. Camilla looks over to her curiously."You...actually have a point there Ms. Marequine. I'm not certain just HOW much this theory applies to plant or fungus class Liminals, even ICEP itself doesn't have any definite answers yet.", Ein replied, "It is certain that these species are at some level compatible to the humanoid genome.""Wow that a bit constraining. When did the word 'mammal' become so loose?", Cheryl giggles"About the same time a bloke named Darwin said humans are essentially fish with legs.", Mirabelle comments"Actually, his theory says humanity developed from bacteria deep in the sea. So...really mammals, reptiles, and such are kinda same thing, I guess. I think at some points evolution kinda swallows it's own foot.", Ein admitted with a chuckle."No no, it makes sense. Humans are just hairless fish-monkey...germs Khehehe.", Mirabelle giggles covering her mouth with her palm. Camilla cracks a little smile finding the quip amusing then looking at Cheryl's reaction."Haha you know that's a MUCH kinder explananation than the one I heard!", Cheryl chuckles heartily surprising Camilla, " IT basically says we're the retarded offspring of five monkeys having sex with a fish-squirrel.", Cheryl stated trying her dambdest not to stutter holding in her laughs."WHAT THE FU-HAHAHAHAHA", Ein bursts into hysterical laughter quickly joined by Mirabelle and and Cheryl. Table slapping and disjointed wheezing chuckles filled the are. Camilla turns away turns away hiding a small grin unable to resist and begins softly chuckling as well.As the laughing dies down, a couple of them take a swig of their drink to sooth their vocal cords."Ohhhhh, blimey that is the most unfortunate thing I ever heard.", Mirabelle sighs wiping the tears from her eye. Suddenly, a thought occurs to Cheryl."Hehe, Hey, um, Mirabelle right? You're from the U.K. aren't you?", Cheryl inquires."Oh, why yes, I am. I was raised in Wales. I wager I didn't do a good job hiding it.", Mirabelle says touching her cheek."Don't hide it. It's always so rare to see British people here in Alabama. Not to mention British CENTAUR people!.", Cheryl spoke with a wide grin."Oh my, I guess I check off both minorities then.", Mirabelle replies in a slightly embarrassed tone. Camilla watched Cheryl with suspicious gaze."Well, you're definitely that I've never even HEARD of a purple Centaur before. You must be crazy rare?", Cheryl stated referring to her appearance, "I mean, you are soooo beautiful. Other Centaurs must be so jealous."Mirabelle looks away and answers in a thoughtful melancholic tone, "I...suppose that's one way to put it."Camilla give a quizzical look to her wondering what she meant. Cheryl quickly picks up that subject may be sensitive to her and decides to backpedal."Uhhh, Ms. Zyklon! What about you? Where are you from?", Cheryl speaking up and changing the subject."Well, I was born in the central province of Thailand. I was raised in Beijing but occasionally went back and forth between the two, kind of grew up speaking both Thai and Mandarin as a result.", Ein says understanding what she was trying to do."Really? You're English is so good though.", Cheryl points out."My father was American so I grew up learning from him. In fact, I learned most things about American culture from him", Ein reminisces fondly."Aww, that sounds nice. Was he, like, a fox liminal too?", Cheryl inquires"E-Excuse me?", Ein raises an eyebrow as Mirabelle and Camilla focus on her."Well yeah I'm sure he was a Fox liminal just like you.""I'm a Kamaitachi. A weasel type. Not a fox, a weasel.", Ein stated firmly."Really? Huh", Cheryl tilts her head examining her features to Ein slight discomfort, "Yeah, I guess I can sorta see it. You DO look more a fox at a quick glance though.""No I don't!", Ein stated firmly emphasizing with her hands. Camilla"I think it's the tail that throws people off. It does look rather fox-like.", Mirabelle added gesturing to her Kamaitachi tail.Ein pinches her eyes together in annoyance, "Ms. Marequine please do not encourage her."Camilla snickers to herself. Cheryl smiles looking to Camilla who give her a 'the fuck you lookin?' at' expression upon making eye contact."What about you, I haven't really much from you since I sat down Ms...um...Santiago or something?", Cheryl guesses"It is 'SarTANA! Speak with your mouth not your culo( ass).", Camilla dismissively rebukes. Mirabelle gives her worried look. She had been dreading what Camilla would do if this human lady makes her angry. Ein watches Camilla and Cheryl carefully being ready for anything."Oh, pfffft, duh!", Cheryl bonks herself on the at how silly she was, "That's my bad, I knew it started with an 'S'."Camilla's raises an eyebrow at her, wondering if she was some breed of moron."Anyway, where are you from? Are you Puerto Rican? Mexican maybe?", Cheryl inquires.Camilla give her a contemptuous look then glances at Mirabelle and Ein; both also awaiting her answer. She was backed in an emotional corner and the only way out is to answer this human's dumb questions."Jes, I am from Mehico.", Camilla answers, "I am an Elder Devil, if ju could no tell, and my favorite color is rojo (red). There is that enough información to keep my satisfied?"Mirabelle gives a disappointed frown. Ein closes her in thought disapproving of her behavior."Well, yeah, but I wouldn't mind learning more and getting to know you better.", Cheryl spoke ignoring Camilla's tone."Why do ju even care?! What do ju get out of this?", Camilla demanded an answer.Cheryl thought for a second, "I...get to know some interesting people. And you seem like guys really interesting.", Cheryl spoke nonchalantly.Camilla's intense expression softens for a moment at her response. Living as long as she has, she's developed affinity for detecting falsehood in people. Nothing this human said...was a lie. She closes her eyes and softly sighs, "Fine. Do as ju may."Mirabelle eyes light up as she and Ein look to the Elder Devil in surprise."Sooooo...is it true Devils are really good at all kinds of magic?!", Cheryl excitedly stated, "Can you levitate stuff?! Can you summon familiars? If so, what are they and what are their names?! Can you use elemental spells? Can you do necromancy?!"Camilla is taken aback as Cheryl bombard her with a stream of questions. Finally she decides to put an end to it, "Enough!"Cheryl pauses as Mirabelle and Ein watch them carefully."Now then, Jes mi gente ARE known for utilizing different forms of the mystic arts. Jes, we can levitate ourselves and other things. We have no need for familiars, only fucking Witches equate slavery to partnership! Jes, elemental spells are very common and easy to learn. And, no, necromancy is taboo among users, which is why everyone agrees Lichs are assholes!", Camilla finished as Mirabelle and rest listened to her.Cheryl's lips curl up in an ecstatic grin her again as Camilla recoils a little anticipating another barrage of questions, "That's amaaaaaaziiiiing. Can you maybe show me some?", Cheryl smiles hopefully.Camilla pauses a moment before glancing at Mirabelle, who gestures with her towards the human girl. Camilla smirks internally getting a wicked idea. Hopefull, this will make the human shut up. She creates a tiny blue magic seal on her finger before a slightly larger one appears below Cheryl's coffee cup as Mirabelle and Ein focus the sight intently and unsure with the Demoness had planned. The Cheryl's amazement, the brown liquid rises from the cup in a minigeyser-like pillar. Cheryl, Mirabelle, Ein look in awe as it quickly morphs into an amorphous diamondback rattle snake with glowing blue eyes. Cheryl cups both of her cheeks grinning in amazement as it slither around her corner of the table. It then coils itself while making its titular rattling sound and hissing as it stared at Cheryl. The demoness smirks and taps table. The coffee snake bares its long fangs and strikes at Cheryl's lips."WAH!", Cheryl shouted falling back in her seat onto the ground as a few other patrons look over to her. Camilla giggles to herself making the snake go right back in the cup as regular coffee again expecting the human to go running away after that tiny display of power."Ms. Sartana!", "Camilla!", Mirabelle and Ein both stated simultaneously to seemingly indifferent demoness."That was very uncalled for! Apologize to-", Ein started berating her only to be cut off."THAT. WAS. AWESOME!", Cheryl shouted excitedly popping up like a jack-in-the-box startling everyone, especially Camilla. Cheryl picks up her cup examining it, "Was that water magic?! I mean it had to, it's the base for coffee so obviously you could control it. I'm guessing from that sygil you made it had to be some type of matter manipulation combined with transmutation. Does the spell have a name?", She spoke rapidly staring starry eyed at Camilla.Camilla fails to utter a single coherent word as she tries to comprehend what was happening."Um, Ms...Banks?", Ein says as Cheryl turns to her curiously. The weasel gestures behind her and Cheryl looks around to see some of the staff and a couple patrons at their tables staring at her."Oh! S-sorry, everyone! I just...took a little there hehehe", Cheryl says sitting her chair right back up before once again taking her seat at the table. The patrons and staff return to what their own business."Ms. Banks we are so sorry about that.", Mirabelle apologizes as Camilla turns quizzical look to her."Oh, it's ok. I guess I kinda got her nerves a bit. It happens sometimes.", Cheryl admitted earning a surprised look from Camilla, "It's just...growing I was really into magic and fantasy. I can't tell you how many books, movies, and tv shows I have obsessed over. I just fell in love with these magical worlds and it's moments like these that remind me what a stupid drooling fantasy nerd I am! ", Cheryl chuckles."I-Is that so? But still, that was rude. Camilla, please apologize to her.", Mirabelle says with half-pleading eyes to Camilla.Camilla wanted to object but knew it would only hurt Mirabelle even more; she couldn't do that to her. She swallows her pride and faces Cheryl, "I'm sorry...", she uttered straining a bit. Mm"Heyyy, it's fine. No hard feelings. I should be thanking you for that amazing display.", Cheryl spoke as Mirabelle and Ein sigh to themselves in relief.Camilla looks at her questioningly. What is with this human girl?"Ahem so...Ms. Banks, what kind of fantasy stories do you like?", Ein inquires changing the subject.Cheryl faces lights up, "Oh all kinds! Especially ones like 'The Night Circus', 'Shades of Magic', and my all time favorite 'The Harry Potter franchise' that all focus on magical destiny and immersive world building!"Camilla feels a pang of irritation at the mention of 'Harry Potter'."Harry Potter huh? I haven't read book but I have seen a couple of the movies. I always did think it was interesting how the characters utilized magic in different ways.", Ein spoke before Camilla shoots her a glare."I knowww right! I mean, the movies are good and all the books really excel in detailing the wondrous things magic is capable of! My favorite spell is 'Accio!' You can use it teleport stuff to you. I would use that alllll the time because I always lose stuff. Anyway, the spells are just fraction of what's amazing about the world. You got potions that change your appearance, flying broomsticks, wands, all kinds of magical objects! Haaa I can't tell ya how much I've longed to attend Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry.", Cheryl croons resting her elbow on table and cheek to her palm."Tch, more like Hogwash school of Bullshit and Bigotry.", Camilla protested making everyone turn their attention to her, "Ju really believe ANY of that is true magic""What do you mean?! Of course it is. I mean, you're magic so obviously most things are right. Right?", Cheryl inquires."Ha! I'd say a least a fraction of their información isn't complete bull.", Camilla replied"You read the books too Camilla?", Mirabelle inquired."I would not say 'I read them' more like they were translated to me by a close member of my former clan when I was still learning to English. We used to laugh at how ridiculous they were.", Camilla answers with a giggle before sipping her coffee then focusing on Cheryl, "Listen human, a lot of that magic you like is just other humans copying what they seen filthy Witches do!"."That's good right? Witches are real, so a lot of the stuff in Harry Potter shows what magic can do.", Cheryl says."No, because ju humans do not realize is Witches copied their knowledge of the mystic arts from Devils!", Camilla stated earning a surprised look from Cheryl, "Only difference is they're bad at it. I mean, WHO in Discord's unholy name heard of needing a wittled stick to project mana when my can more easily summon a sygil?! The only notable spells they've created on their own are charms used to seduce men by making their bodies appear as young girls."Mirabelle raises an eyebrow, "Um, exactly how young?""Young.", Camilla cryptically answers making Mirabelle shudder with a disturbed frown, "Some nonsense about expressing the superiority of the underdeveloped female forms."Right then, the distinct sound of a piece of silverware falling and hitting a plate caught their attention. They turn and catch a glimpse of Ein with a disturbed look before hastily putting on a bashful act."Ah, whoopsie! Fork slipped, I've got butter fingers hehehe", Ein giggles nervously avoiding eye contact. They each give her a weird look before returning to their conversation."Anyway, yeah, but the witches in Harry Potter don't practice any...reverse pedophilia. They still need their wand to control the magic that naturally dwells within them and precisely direct it in the path they want.", Cheryl replies."Just one path? Pfff", Camilla spoke unimpressed before folding her arms and leaning back. Suddenly, twelve small magic seals of different colors of the rainbow and demonic symbols appear around her as Cheryl and the rest look on in shock and intrigue, "Why choose one when I get choose however many directions I please so long as I have enough mana? Truly experienced users like myself can summon multiple seals with just a thought. And I can draw limitless mana from literally anywhere instead of from the finite amount in my OWN body."Camilla uncrosses her and the seals vanish completely, "Put me or any other one of mi gente(my people) in the ring with a Witch from THAT world or this one and we'd lay them out before they COULD think of a spell to cast. Right after breaking their stupid little sticks."Cheryl thinks for a moment, "I...guess you make a good point there but thing is Witches and Wizards are born with the magic gene that allows them to use magic. So they kinda have to draw from within to use it.""That is stupid. Ju can be born with an AFFINITY for the mystic arts but ju cannot...produce mana out of your body. It has to be absorbed as mana then utilized through practiced control.", Camilla corrected"Ok, so could wands still be used to collect to control it?", Cheryl inquires"Forget about the wands!", Camilla stated in annoyance, "And another thing! Why are HUMANS the only ones that can use magic in that world and NON-humans can't?!"Ein and Mirabelle look over to each other as the demoness and human woman went back and forth. Mirabelle shrugs with a grin to which Ein nods returning the grin. Both glad that Camilla was at least talking to her at all. Progress. Suddenly, the blonde elf waitress from before appears and whispers to Ein."Um, excuse ma'am but we've gotten a couple complaints about how loud you're being and it's disturbing the customers. I ask that-""It's ok.", Ein interrupted her before showing her MON badge, "Everything is under control. This is healthy for her, trust me. I promise things will calm down soon. Also, how about some more tea cakes for our table?""O-Ok...then.", The elf girl whispers reluctantly stepping away from their table.Ein refocuses on Camilla and Cheryl still having their 'argument'."Ok, but surely you think magical artifacts are cool. Like horkruxes.", Cheryl spoke."OHHH FUCKING HORKRUXES!", Camilla angrily stated. Ein and Mirabelle sweatdropped....***While that's going on...***The group soon arrived at Mahkah' s campsite. It was an open space that was mostly cleared out for people wishing to camp out. There was flowing stream for fishing and the trail as close for rangers to freely patrol the area and check up on campers. There were two tents between the four of them meaning they obviously slept in pairs. They had a small barbecue spit they used for roasting hot dogs along few quail and rabbits the male Inari and Hollo hunted earlier; with permission from park staff of course."Ahhh oomf", Zwei bites into her hot dog watching with cold, grumpy stare as Lyca and her apparent sister chatted it up and scarfed down their roasted rabbit meat across from her."I can't believe it's really you.", Lyca spoke happily, "I almost didn't recognize you, you sure have changed alot!""Me?! What about you?! Last time I saw you, you were so skinny I could see your rib bones!", Hollo stated.Lyca sheepishly rubs the back of her head, "Ehehehe I...I guess I was huh?""But look at you now! You got muscles and stuff! I bet you could take down a bear!", Hollo stated in admiration."Thanks, you look even stronger though! You could take on FIVE bears!", Lyca stated encouragingly."This gene pool needs more chlorine.", Drei muttered to herself.Zwei rolls her eyes then takes another bite of her hotdog, "Ahhh oomf""Zwei why you eating like an anime girl?", Drei, who sat next to her eating some roasted quail, asks plainly, "How are you so good at that? Do you train the art of moe?"Zwei ignores her as she continues to watch them. Sitting parallel to them, Caleb, Mahkah, and the Kobold was finishing up cleaning the carving tools. The Inari then exited one of the tents carrying what looked to be a large red coolerCaleb grins to himself seeing Lyca getting along with her sister."They sure are getting along well.", spoke Mahkah. Caleb turned to see him, "But, I guess that's to be expected. So...how are you folks feeling now?""Better, much better now that we've settled ourselves.", Caleb says in relief before noticing the skeptical look from the Kobold lady."I'd hardly call things 'settled'.", said the Kobold folding her arms. It was then Caleb noticed her Canadian accent, "You start a kerfuffle with one of our own and expect us to just forget about it? Then ya go mouthing off at us like WE did anythin' wrong! Deplorable doughheaded!", she stated in a venomous tone as Lyca and Hollo turned their attention to what's going on."Not to mention plain rude!", Added the Inari boy in a noticeable Korean accent. Hollo started to rise up to say something until..."Emáčiyapi!", Mahkah stated in unknown language making the Inari and Kobold immediately go quiet, "That's enough from both of-""No!", Caleb interrupts standing up, "They're right. I'm sorry for yelling at y'all like that. I panicked...my mind was all over the place and I just...had to vent a little. That's no excuse that just an explanation. Things have been crazy for us; way crazier than you'd believe and we're just being very cautious. I apologize for attacking your houseguest."Mahkah exchanged looks with the Inari and Kobold. They could sense the sincerity in his voice. Suddenly, Lyca's sister stands up from her position."It's ok, you weren't the one who attacked me.", she then shoots a glare at Zwei then points at her, "SHE is the one who needs to apologize.", She said with a scowl.Zwei tenses before standing up defiantly, "Oh please! How did you expect me to react when you looked so suspicious skulking in the bushes like some kind of pervert?!""Master debating there sis.", Drei comments giving thumbs up as Zwei puffs her cheeks at her."ZWEI!", Caleb stated firmly startling the girl, "Apologize to her, right now! Otherwise, I'll spoil the end to Devilman Crybaby!""Noooo! I'm still on episode 7!", Zwei pleaded fearing of losing the sense of surprise even after avoiding all spoiler on the internet. She begrudgingly faces Hollo who stands arms crossed expectantly, "I...I'm sorry for attacking. That was wrong of me to assume the worst."Hollo's scowl morphs into a delighted grin, "I accept.", she then returns to her seat as Lyca flashes toothy smile at Lyca. Hollo smiles at Mahkah and her other housemates."Well...then I guess all is forgiven. Wouldn't you both agree?", Mahkah says to the Kobold and Inari."They seem like ok people, so I'll forgive them too.", the Inari boy spoke."Errrrgh, I guess I'm fine with it too, but that doesn't mean I'm not watching them.", The Kobold statedCaleb sighs plopping back down in his seat then turning to Mahkah, "Haaaa, you know what? How about we start over from the beginning?"Mahkah smiles, "Yeah, that sounds good. You wanna start?""Yeah. Even though I...kinda already told'ja but I'm Caleb Bizzell. The big bad black wolf over there is Lyca. She's my houseguest and I'm her host for the exchange program.""Hiiiii!", Lyca chirped sweetly tail wagging."The teenage windy ninja weasels over there are my ICEP bodyguards, Zwei and Drei.", Caleb gestures to them."Yo, nice to officially pretend to meet ya.", "Hi, I'm 22 and fuck you.", Both girls answer respectively as Drei flips the bird at Caleb."They're great when you get to know'em", Caleb spoke with a grin"Is that what you tell yourself?", The Kobold stated."Every morning I get outta bed ma'am.", Caleb replied still grinning as the Kobold simply scoffs.Mahkah chuckles for a moment before answering, "haha, hey there. My name's Mahkah Cox. I'm a host too. You guys already met one of my wards, Hollo.""Nice to meet everyone!", Hollo says waving to everyone before going over Mahkah side."This one here is Rebecca. Don't worry, she's actually a lot sweeter when she gets used to you.", Mahkah spoke gesturing to the Kobold lady."Y-Y-You know you don't have to mimic him right?", Rebecca stated defiantly blushing through her fur(somehow) before plopping down next to him crossing her legs."I think it's more like Bro's just stating a fact. You DO like to wear your heart on armless sleaves.", Inari boy pointed out then sits down next to Mahkah placing the cooler beside them."Oh shut it, Fox. I'm in no mood for your jokes!", Rebecca retorted pointing at him threateningly."Facts are only jokes if spoken by liars and people who use the word "literally" in every sentence.", The Inari boy quipped."I like this kid.", Drei spoke. Mahkah then pushes the fox boy's head down eliciting a startled yelp from him."And THIS little one here is Min-Jun.", Mahkah spoke playfully ruffling up the fox boy's hair."Hahaha stop that! I'm not even that little! I'm gonna be 18 in two weeks!", Min-Jun chuckles trying to wriggle away."You're always gonna be a little yellow puff ball to me!", Hollo spoke as she help Mahkah but ruffling up the foxes fur as her playfully struggled to get away."Heh, you guys sure are close.", Caleb spoke taking a bite of his hot dog."You bet! We're a pack.", Hollo stated hugging Mahkah close mushing her C-cup breasts into his shoulder. Min-Jun puts his arms behind his head trying to look cool as Rebecca pulls Mahkah toward her bosom making sure Hollo doesn't completely smother him.Caleb grins at them before Lyca bounces over to his side."You're pack is amazing Hollo!", Lyca stated.Hollo releases Mahkah much to his relief, "Haha, yep! You have an awesome pack too Lyca! Look, we even the same number of pack mates!", she spoke pointing around to her group then Caleb's."Oh, actually there ARE more of us; Ein, Mira, Cami. They're off doing stuff together right now. We'll meet up with them later.""Wow.", Hollo utters giving a surprised look both at the fact that her sister had more pack mates than her and that she trusted them enough not to defect and start their own packs."So, what brings you guys out here? Enjoying the beauty of nature?", Mahkah inquoted reaching into the cooler and pulling out a can of diet Dr. Pepper offering it to Caleb. Caleb's eyes immediately light up in delight before graciously accepting it. Zwei and Drei proceed to get up to get something to drink. Mahkah pop open a can of DD Pepper too and it was then Caleb noticed that half the cooler was all DD pepper.."Heh, looks like I'm not the only Dr. Pepper enthusiast here.", Caleb quipped popping his lid."How can I not be? It's only THE best drink ever created by man.", Mahkah replied."Goddamn right it is my brother.", Caleb says before the two men reach over and clink their cans together before relishing in the cold, burning sensation of the delicious carbonated beverage. The girl and Min-Jun glance at each other at the apparent bromance forming before them."Anyway, yeah I guess you could say that. Nothing like some fresh Appalachian mountain air.", Caleb says before popping the cap, "Lyca and I were actually spending some quality time together. You know, bond a little, get to know each other better, and more importantly have fun.", Caleb finishes petting Lyca on the head as she happily"Oh, so you guys are on a little nature hike date. You guys definitely look like you're having fun.", Min-Jun spoke before drinking his Fanta orange."We sure are!", Lyca says hugging Caleb affectionately, "We're been having loads of fun! Right Chief?"Caleb looks off to the side thoughtfully, "Yyyyyep, loads of fun.""Cheif?", Mahkah inquires"Oh, it's just what Lyca calls me. Is it weird?", Caleb says."No no, it's fine. Honestly, it's better than what these two want to call me.", Mahkah says gesturing to Hollo and Rebecca."W-what's wrong with me calling you 'Master' Master?!", Rebecca and Hollo stated simultaneously with concerned eyes. Mahkah recoils slightly from them stating that in each ear."I'm your Alpha female! Why shouldn't I call you as such?", Hollo spoke candidly pressing harder into him to Rebecca's annoyance."Will you quit it with that?! We are not wolves!", Rebecca protested to which Hollo puff her cheeks out at her."Well, we are technically canines and humans and canines ARE social animals, so I guess that logic applies.", Min-Jun pointed out."Don't encourage her!", Rebecca retorted."I'm just saying. Besides 'pack' is pretty subjective. I mean Lyca's pack has two cats in it.", Min-Jun continued."We're Kamaitachi.", Zwei and Drei spoke plainly simultaneously."Tomadachi?", Min-Jun replies"No, 'Ka-mai-tah-chi'. We're a type of weasel liminal. We're like native to most parts of Asia.", Zwei clarified."Well I'm South Korean but I'm sure some weasels look like cats in Asia.", Min-Jun affirms certain of himself.Zwei pauses a moment with an incredulous look, "...What?!""You know what, that actually reminds me, you two said you were his "bodyguards". What are you protecting him from?","Sorry, that's on a need to know basis. Like whether a platonic relationship with an attractive childhood friend.", Drei stated plainly."Drei, come on, it's only fair that they know a little. Please, I wanna make things right here.", Caleb says giving her an inquiring look.Drei looks at Zwei, who shrugs an 'eh, why not?', before turn back to Caleb, "Alright, but not too much detail. I'll be the judge on where you'll whitewash some stuff."Caleb nods before turning to Mahkah's group as they waited for him to begin, "Ok, so...it's basically like this."...***Back to Mirabelle's group***Mirabelle and the girls eventually left the cafe having gotten their fill of sweets, caffeine, and conversation and decided to do some sight-seeing around the shopping district...with their extra addition."Ohhhh my god. These are beautiful. I'd know pearls in so many colors", Cheryl spoke admiring the pearls, multicolored shells, and other underwater trinkets being sold by a crab girl (they're called 'Cancers' but...no.), "How did you find so many varieties?"As the crab girl gives Cheryl an explanation, Mirabelle stood with Ein and Camilla near the water fountains grinning at the sight of the woman's childlike excitement. She then looks to the side at Camilla who wore a sour demeanor looking as though she wanted to leave as quickly as possible."Camilla, please don't be like this.", Mirabelle spoke just loud enough for Camilla to hear her. The demoness gives her a side glance, "I just had to say "yes" to letting her join us. I couldn't just tell her to leave. Besides she really seems like nice person.""Jes, but I could have to her!", Camilla stated in annoyance, "and I do not care for how nice she "seems", humans, especially females, put on masks like hers all the time. I'll admit I found enlightening her feeble and skewed brain mildly on true mystic arts slightly engaging, but only because I thought she would soon be out of my life forever and I could continue with our day.""That attitude of yours Ms. Sartana is another reason Mr. Bizzell wanted us to do this. Both yourself and Ms. Marequine eventually won't need him or me to be around whenever your leave the house so it's important you learn to conduct yourselves properly in public. There is no need to be so hostile toward Ms. Banks, just look at her as practice for socializing with other humans. Plus, I agree with Ms. Marequine, she seems like a nice girl. A bit chatty but still nice.", Ein finished whispering loudly to Camilla. Mirabelle looks away pensively realizing what she said was undoubtedly true."Tch, ju make sound like it's a privilege to be among these swine. Anyone can pretend to be nice but give them the right push and they show their true nature. That's the it's always been.", Camilla spoke coldly looking around at the various people passing them by. Her thoughts turning to all the horrid things she's witnessed humans do to her people and each other. Their hypocrisy, their cruelty towards anything they deem worthless."Pleeaase Camilla.", Mirabelle pleaded as Camilla makes eye contact with her. She felt her coldness melting away from the warmth of her purple gemlike gaze, "Please, give Ms. Banks a chance. I promise if things don't work out we'll say our goodbyes to her. But, please, just lets try getting to know her first."Camilla grumbles to herself, "Nnngnnh, fine, but I'm not doing it because I want to know anything. I want ju both to see she's just as hypocritical as any other human.""Even Mr. Bizzell?", Ein spoke.Camilla shot her a glare but remained quiet unable to find the words."Hey guys!", Cheryl stated approaching Mirabelle and the rest, "That crab lady over there is an absolute sweetheart and you should see the beautiful ocean jewelry she's selling. Just wish it wasn't all so expansive though."Camilla turns away with a huff. Mirabelle and Ein notice and give her disappointed or annoyed glares."Is...everything alright?", Cheryl inquires with a concerned look."N-no no, everything is fine we were just talking trying to decide on what to do next.", Ein spoke assuredly."There are just...SO many options. It's practically mindboggling eheheh", Mirabelle added in her most convincing tone.Cheryl glances at Camilla before turning back to Centaur and Wind Weasel, "Ok, how about we just go look around a bit? You know kill some time maybe we'll find something we can all enjoy.""I suggest we check out the some of the booths demonstrating various liminal goods and crafts.", Ein says pointing to the street with multiple humans and liminals selling and buying each others goods."Sounds good to me.", Cheryl spoke with a grin. Ein proceeds on leading them down the sidewalk with Mirabelle, Camilla, and Cheryl right behind her. Mirabelle notices Camilla purposely keeping her distance from Cheryl as possible. Cheryl appeared to the be more distracted by the liminal-human pairs all walking around and some posing for people taking pictures of them on their phones. Mirabelle looks down in thought wondering if this really was a good idea. She knew how Camilla felt about human but she also knew she didn't want her to living like that. Honestly, she just thought it'd be something Caleb would do. Knowing him that is. Was she doing the right thing though?"Ohhh my God!.", Cheryl stated snapping Mirabelle out of her thoughts. The girls stop to see Cheryl gesturing at a small stand filled to the brim with Alabama Crimson Tide merchandise. Mugs, licence plates, banners, bandanas, plates, shot glasses, t-shirts, yoga pants; Lterally, everything was colored red and white with a capital 'A' logo. What's better, the stand was run by a Kobold girl who had apparently dyed one-half of her entire body white and the other half red. She also wore red shorts and white top with the same logo and sported a peppy grin, "It's even spreading to other races!""What is?", Ein inquires"The craze every football obsessed Alabamian involuntarily imposes on every person that enters the state. She a part of 'Roll Tide' now.", Cheryl spoke eerily."Roll tide roll! Hehehe, ah but seriously, can I interest you ladies in these commemorative shirts. We now have them in designs to suit other species. You, miss! You should view some of our Centaurian line of cloaks and horseshoes.", The peppy Kobold spoke showing a magazine with pictures of Centaurs wearing Crimson tide themed cloaks along with red and white shoes and shirts."U-um...that's quite lovely but I don't really need that at the moment.", Mirabelle stuttered before Cheryl steps up."That's right! We're kinda running late anyway!", Cheryl stated hurrying the girls along."Ok! Feel free to come back if you change your minds!", The Kobold yelled."Ah geez, that was a close one.", Cheryl sighed."What was that all about?", Ein inquires."Sorry, but once those guys have even a fraction of your interest they won't stop until you've bought a monthly Alabama football subscription plan and at least $600 dollars worth of memorabilia.", Cheryl spoke as they continued down the sidewalk passing the gates to the outside patio of a pizza restaurant."That's...oddly manipulative.",Ein said raising an eyebrow."Yeah, but it's just a part of life here in Alabama. Take the good with the crap as they say.", Cheryl stated before a thought occurs to her, "Actually, I wanna know, how are YOU guys adjusting to life here in Alabama? I'm sure it's VERY different compared to what your used to.""Hmm, I actually haven't been in the country that long so the jury is still out on my opinion but I can say(all things considered) life here is fairly lax. Especially compared to the huddle and bussle in my old city.", Ein explains as they stop at a cross walking waiting as the cars drive by, "It also takes some getting used to not bowing whenever I see an elderly person. Where I'm from it's just tradition to respect the elderly, but here, people look at me like a weirdo.""I doubt THAT is the reason they look at ju strangely.", Camilla commented as Ein gives her blank glare."What about you, Mirabelle?", Cheryl spoke."Well...I have been living here three months now and thanks to Dear I've learned quite a lot about this state and fairly adjusted to life here. I'm familiar with its significance in history during the American Civil Rights Movement along with facts like; the capital is 'Montgomery', the state bird is the Yellow Hammer, and it's commonly known as the 'Heart of Dixie'. He says that's basically all the common knowledge you need to know.", Mirabelle giggles as they cross the street passing a human man and Medusa couple, "I've mostly been learning about human practices and laws of this state, how to use services like banks or post office , or just how things like currency here works. Turns out a dollar is VERY different from a pound.""Ugh, do not get me started Señora.", Camilla started, "Whoever in this country decided Mi patria's (My homeland's) currency to be nearly worthless here should be burned alive in the middle of town.""That's kind of overreacting but I agree. Adjusting to this country's monetary system has been a hassle. And I don't even wanna talk about getting used to English units of measurement. Why can't you Americans just join the rest of the world.", Ein stated in annoyance."Because we're stubborn and refuse to change the outdated and unconventional words of a bunch of old white guys from 500 years ago.", Cheryl answered. The girls each give her inquisitive looks.Mirabelles lightly chuckles, "Hahaha, but, you know despite all of that, I still feel a bit out of sorts here. There are just times where...it doesn't feel natural me being here. ""I don't think so. The way you handled that crimson Kobold just now seemed pretty natural to me.", Cheryl spoke."Well... that was hardly a bother. Dear and I sometimes come across them on one of our field trips. Hehe he refers to them as, and I quote, "Jehovah witnesses of sports." ", Mirabelle giggles reminiscing, "Hahaha then he'd do this routine saying something like "Excuse me miss, would you like to take a moment to talk about our couch and savior Nick Saban?", She spoke in her best Caleb impression before chuckling. Ein and Camilla giggle and snort ignoring the humans look at them curiously."Hahahaha! That's a new one!", Cheryl chuckles, " Also...when you say 'Dear', you mean the guy who's your host right? Caleb, that's his name."Camilla gives a suspicious look from the side feeling the human was overstepping her boundaries."The one and only. It's just what I call him because...he's so dear to me. He always knows how to put me at ease.", Mirabelle answers wistfully cupping her cheek. Ein looks back worried she'll say something she really shouldn't."Ohhhh, that's so sweet.", Cheryl croons, "Does he have a pet name for you too?"" Ms. Banks, I don't th-", Ein start but was interrupted"Oh, he...um, calls me 'Moon pie' ", Mirabelle blushes with a grin."Oh my god, that's adorable!", Cheryl squealed in a high-pitched voice to Camilla's chagrin before returning to her normal voice, "You know what I had a feeling you guys were close because you just look so good together. So how long you guys been dating?"Camilla looked ready to shut her up forcefully before Ein beats her to the punch (metaporically)"They're not!", Ein stated getting their attention before noticing the curious gazes of the strangers around them and decides to switch to a more subtle tone, "Listen, Ms. Banks, despite present circumstances, romantic relationships between humans and liminals are still against the law. It's necessary individuals like Marequine and Bizzell remain out of the public eye as much as possible.""Uhh, Ms. Zyklon, I hate to break to ya but couples like them are popping up more than ever. I mean look around.", Cheryl countered gesturing around her at the several human-liminal pairs openly displaying acts of affection. Ein's eyes widen when she seeing a human woman and a male Giant Hornet kissing much to the disapproval and disgust of some of the other patrons. Then a young man with a Jackelope woman walking together and holding hands, "Ever since that protest last week against legalizing human liminal marriage there's been a lot of folks showing their support for it by just coming in public and openly displaying their relationships with their homestays. You know, making like a nonverbal statement to all the racists out there."Mirabelle and the girls listen to her explanation with varying degrees of interest and amazement."I understand and it's a noble act but it's because of all the racists and bigots who view us as monsters that they need to be more careful. This state like others in this part of the country are filled with people unwilling to accept us. ICEP forces can only do so much so often and we can't always prevent the worst case from happening because of well-meaning carelessness.", Ein says glancing around to ensure no one was listening."Yeah...here in the South it's either go Christian or go away. Alabama isn't any different. Even Southern hospitality is kind of a double edged sword when people can smile in your face then go right to talking shit about you ", Cheryl admitted slowing her pace a bit as Mirabelle looks back in concern. Cheryl then perks up, "But, it is what it is, nothing's ever perfect. Besides these people showing their support tells how much things are changing, and for the better. Oh, and just so you know, I support you and Caleb relationship 1000%. Love is love, species is irrelevant after all.", Cheryl finished citing the supporters' mantra.Mirabelle grins warmly at her encouragement as Ein felt a bit more certain about having the girl tag along with them. Even Camilla is genuinely surprised by her words."Thank you Ms. Banks for saying that", Mirabelle spoke politely."Meh, just my two cents on it.", Chery shrugs nonchalantly.Camilla gives her a quizzical look out of the corner of her eye. She was starting to become frustrated. Normally, she'd have someone's intentions and nature figured out within minutes. But, this time is different. She can't get a solid read on this woman. Was it because this girl was too simpleminded to be a real threat? Or are the walls she's put up over the decades keeping her from seeing what was in front of her? The only other time her brain was this wracked was when...she met Caleb. She shakes her head knowing that was different. He's her Destino, even if she was still learning what that truly meant. THIS girl...was nothing to her. That's how it should be...right?"Hey, check that out!", Cheryl stated snapping Camilla out of her thoughts. She looks to see the human pointing ahead as Mirabelle and Ein wore awestruck expressions. Camilla looks ahead eyes widening upon seeing what looked to be a combination of an art exhibit and flower garden in the middle of street corner between two buildings. The entrance appeared to be constructed of spiraling vines forming an arching gate with red and white roses growing out and sign hanging from it. To the left, stands filled with a rainbow of flowers. They could make out what appeared to be two humanoid liminals with giant butterfly wings (Papillon) fluttering about doing ballerina twirls. To the right was what looked to be numerous objects they couldn't quite make out."That looks interesting.", Mirabelle spoke her eyes twinkling brightly, "Shall we go check it out?""I don't see why not.", Ein spoke.The group continued to their chosen destination as Camilla glances Cheryl then Mirabelle pensively. They arrive at the entrance getting a better view of the area. There different types flowesr from tiger lilies to roses arranged in bouquets, baskets, and ornamental reefs along with bags of soil near the bottom. There also appeared to be fold in tables with numerous small jars with different color liquid substances inside and surrounding wheeled carts with colorful fabrics, ribbons, bows, and chokers. Working them were three more Papiliion. Each dressed in maiden-like attire(see wiki picture) but with different colored wing patterns. Alongside the front of the lot, there was a stand that appeared to be constructed almost entirely out of tree roots and green vines with two giant couch sized flowers; one blue with yellow polka-dots the other with red with yellow tips on the petals. Inside those flowers were two Alraune ladies with typical green, leafy curvaceous bodies but blooms from their heads that matched their respective giant flower bodies. Their stand mainly consisted of small pouches of candies, jars of coloful liquid, and what appeared to piles of something resembling dragon fruit in wooden crates. To the left, were a vast assortment of art supplies from acrylic paints to stencils along with several portraits and ready-made sculptures made of different materials from metal to wood. There were two humanoid women working the area. One seated in front of a human man and woman sketching them as they posed smiling and the other moving boxes of supplies. Both women appeared to have three eyes with the third in the center of their forehead( Triclops). Several humans wandered in and out of the area buying bouquets, candies, or paintings. The girls notice how some of the humans, particularly men, seem to leave the Papiliion stands with large smiles plastered on their faces."~Welllcommme!~", came a singsongy yet enchanting voice. The girls turn their attention upwards as one of the Papiliion descends down. Their gazes captivated by the otherworldly beauty of her emerald green wings with purple splashes that shimmered in the sunlight leaving a sparkling trail of green and purple dust. Her arms were extended welcomingly, a smile that radiated warmth, emerald insect-like eyes, lime green hair, a slender but curvaceous figure in her black and green flower maiden outfit with an opening for her D-cup breasts. Her feet touch the ground as her wings fold in and she does a polite curtsy with her dress, "So glaaad you could join us. My name is Valerie, you see~""O-Oh...um thank you?", Ein uttered snapping from her daze, "What...is this place now?""~Ohhhh, well it originally supposed to be a small venue for ourrrr bu-sin-ness to make to make it's debuuuut~, Valerie the Papillon hummed whimsically, "It's the first of hope-FUL-ly many. Come, be the first join the 'Heart of Eee-Den', you see~"" 'Heart of Eden'?", Mirabelle inquired curiously while Camilla examines the Papillon scrutinously. She reminded her of a character from a comedy movie Señor showed them last week. What was it called? Wayne's World?"~That's right, my sweet little darling. This is the be-gih-ning of our mission to bring a smile to every face and love back into the hearts of thooose who've lost it in these woeful times, you see. The power of flowers is a wondrous thing, you see~", Valerie croons caressing Mirabelle cheek much to the Nightmare's slight embarassment as her wings fluttered spreading some sparkling dust around her legs. Ein peaks behind her seeing several humans near the flowers smiling happily as if without a care in the world all while four other Papillon attentively service( *wink*) them. She raises an eyebrow seeing a blonde one with red, gold, and green wings straight up give a male customer a peck on the cheek for buying a bouquet."~We select only the healthiest of flowers and collect only the sweeeeetest of nectars from our Alraune companionnns~.", Valerie spoke gesturing to the two Alraunes stand. The two Alraune notice and at her delighted before returning to their customers. Valerie turns back to Mirabelle's group, "~We Papillon share a NAT-ur-ral symbiosis with Alraune, you see. This area is like our purlieu for all of nature's pleasures.~""But...what those the art supplies, portraits, and statues over there?", Cheryl inquires immediately getting the attention of one of the Triclops'."~Ahhhh yes. Excellent question darling~ ", Valerie raising a finger 'ah-ha!', "You see, when the lovely people from ICEP approved of our noble endeavors. They unknowingly be-STO-owed us the honor of cohabitating our space with wonderful people who possess a refined AP-ti-tude for the colonial arts."Mirabelle and the others give her blank, questioning stares."What she's TRYING to stay is-!", stated one of the Triclops who suddenly pops up surprising Mirabelle and the girls, "ICEP screwed up the land operations permits so we to share a service with each other for the next six weeks.", she spoke languidly."~Ohohoho, oh Kim-BER-ly you are a true delight.~", Valerie croons."Uggghhh, will you just let them in already they're blocking the entrance.", The, apparently named Kimberly, urges in clear annoyance while pointing a Mirabelle's group with a line of humans and other liminals starting to form.Valerie nods and flutters backwards allowing Mirabelle and the rest together freely walk inside. Immediately, Mirabelle goes over to the flowers examining the many assortment with a giddy expression. Camilla looks a Mirabelle excitedly checking the flowers wanting to joining her but realizing she'd likely get bored after about 5 minutes. Instead, she was intrigued by the different portraits and art supplies close by. She was particularly interested in the water color paint set"Hey, they have some high quality supplies here. Oh, look Ms. Camilla they even have watercolors!", Cheryl stated ecstatically before Camilla turns away ignoring her. Cheryl then notices a readymade sculpture of what looked like a giant beartrap painted brown to give the illusion of rust, "Whoa, look at this Ms. Camilla you definitely tell the artist was feeling some intense emotions during the creation of this. There's a big of symbolism in bear trapped not only with themselves but with someone causing them great distress and uncertainty."Camilla rolls her eyes thinking how much she ca relate to that right now.Ein looks between Mirabelle and Camilla and Cheryl, "Well they sure found their niches quickly.", she spoke as Kimberly the Triclops stands oddly close to her."Ahhh yes, they are drawn to their inner most passions and desires just as all should be.", Valerie hummed whimsically.Suddenly, they were joined by another Papillon. This one with red-orange hair, orange insect eyes, wearing a similar maiden outfit as Valerie except with dark orange highlights, and butterfly wings similar to a monarch butterfly. She smiles lovingly at Ein."~Hellooooo, miss. Might I offer you a chance to partake in our LU-xu-rious condensed skin oil? This one is made from pure dafodill and Lily extractions combined Alraune nectaur, you see~", she spoke presenting a perfume-like bottle honey colored liquid, "i~t can even be used on fur. It could give your...already healthy...and soft fur even more...softness.~""Uhh, thank you...very much but I fine.", Ein says taking a step back not at all comfortable in the sultriness in her tone."Ah, such a polite young lady.", the orange hair says to Valerei"~indeed, indeed~.", Valerie agrees before turning to Ein and the Triclops, "Be as free as you'd like and Ex-pl-ore ours and our confidante's wares. Tata for now, huhuhu.", Valerie and orange hair flutter upwards leaving trails of sparkling dust to which Ein swipes her hand creating tiny gusts of wind to blow them away.Ein sheepishly rubs the back of her head, "Jeez, they're like if prozac took a whole bottle of prozac.""That's ONE way of saying it.", the Triclops girl spoke coldly."Hehe, yeah, well at least they're not that bad.", Ein says earning a look from the Kimberly, "I mean, you sharing this space with them must be pretty nice.""Hehehe "pretty nice" she says. Hahahahahaaaa "pretty ni-yahajahaha!", Kimberly maniacally giggles while also keeping her voice down much to Eins confusion.She then tightly grabs Ein by the shoulder and glares with derangement in all three of them, "Let me tell you something, girly! This past two week working with these wackos has been pure heaven! That's my new word for HELL because of them. I didn't think it was possible to make niceness a torture weapon but the FOUND a way. These Fu-ckin bit-ches found a way. Imagine the Papillons are barbed wire and the Alraune are baseball bats. AKA the perfect combo to fuck. Yo. Life.""Ummm, o-ok. I'm s-sorry to here tha-", Ein utters in slight fear trying to pull away from the unstable girl only for her to get right back in Ein's face."We have BARELY been able to move our inventory since we set up! Everyone only come for THEM! Honestly, the way they conduct business I am SHOCKED we haven't been shutdown for harassment complaints! They got men and even WOMEN under their sick spell.", Kimberly stated pointing to one of the Papiliion, a blue haired one with sky blue wing, holding out a piece of Alraune candy in each hand as a human man and female lizardman leaning over accepting them in their mouth. Ein winces slightly thinking that is not sanitary, "It's a goddamn mystery. Be careful not to be sucked in.", Kimberly whispered venomously."OOooookay! Thank you, I'll just gonna check on my friends", Ein uttered trying to get away."Commmme back soon.", Said a Papillon with bright pink hair with red, white, and pink wings waving goodbye to a human man carrying two flowers and bag full of Alraune fruits with a goofy grin on his face. She then notices Ein and approaches with welcoming grin, "Ahhh, hello, may I help you with anything? Maybeeee you like a welcome hug?""No thank you, I'm just looking around for.", Ein answered before quickly power-walking away.The pink Papillon then notices Kimberly, "Ohh, Kim-BER-ly, would you like a-""Nope. Didn't ask, don't want it, fuck off.", Kimberly cuts her off as she turns going back to her side of the lot."Maybe later thennnnn. I love you!", Pinky stated waving and fluttering her wings."I DON'T CARE!", Kimberly shouted back.***Back to Caleb***A silence befell the camp with only the plaintiff sounds of the rushing stream and birds chirping in the woods to give some modocum of life back into the area. Mahkah and his words sat in deep remunation after the shocking story Caleb just told them. He kept the details at a mminum as to keep things breif but also not give them too much information; mainly focusing on the events of the 4th of July weekend and Caleb's kidnapping/torture by Azaeli. Hollo in particular could not begin comprehend what she just heard. She look at her sister then to the scar on her lower abdomen she somehow had been ignorant to before. To think her sister fought against a liminal of such terrifying description without hesitation and NEARLY died in the process. Zwei and Drei sat observing the reactions of the people before them while enjoying some quail eggs Min Jun kindly brought them."Wow. Just...wow.", said Min Jun his mouth slightly agape as he digested the details of the story. He felt disturbed by the brutal nature of what Caleb endured yet, at the same time, a bit of excitement and admiration."Yeah.", Caleb uttered lethargically sipping his Dr. Pepper before continuing, "That's pretty much the gist of it ""S-So...the Angel is...dead?", Rebecca inquired hesitantly."Yep, impaled in the throat by an ornamental cross. Ironic right?", Caleb spoke bitterly finishing his drink to the shock of some of them. Drei simply closes her eyes in thought. She sensed he hated talking about this stuff."You don't seem to feel all that bad about it?", Rebecca replies."Oh, i'm sorry, YOU try getter tortured for hours then watch an innocent girl die right in front of you, then i'll ask YOU 'do you feel bad'!", Caleb retorted irately Lyca attempts to calm him."Chief, it's ok, don't be mad.",Lyca say in gentle tone."I'M NOT-", Caleb shouted making Lyca jump back in fear before he caught himself. He sees the sadnessf in the She-Wolf's eyes as his anger starts to wane. He glances around the see everyone staring at him like he was dangerously insane. He looks to see he had crushed the aluminium can thin as an empty toothpaste took and didn't even feel any pain. He lets it fall to his feet before looking down in shame, "I-I'm not angry. I'm just..."Mahkah raises up and slaps a hand and Caleb's shoulder making him jerk his head up."It's alright man, we understand. All that is a lot for anyone to deal with. Don't force yourself for our sake.", Mahkah assured before looking to his wards expectantly."Y-yeah! We won't force it out of you if it hurts that much.", Hollo spoke understandingly."That's right! So sorry for casting such unjust scorn on you like that.", Rebecca apologized with earnest conviction."Take you time. You already apologized, it was just a misunderstanding anyway. All is good man.", Min Jun stated candidly.Caleb inhales and exhales then Mahkah gives him a couple pats on the back, "Thanks. Sorry for hollering at y'all...again.""It's fine. You're good.", Mahkah spoke.Lyca scoots over to Caleb and touches her hands to his then smiles at him. He accepts while gently stroking her furrry hand,"Hey, there's...one thing I kinda wanna know?", Mu Jin inquired as every turned their attention to the two tailed yellow fox, "If those gangsters can really send anyone after you anytime, isn't dangerous for you guys to go out like this at all? Aren't you afraid they'll attack you or one of your homestays?""Jun!", Rebecca barks prepared to scold the fox boy who puts his hands up defensively. He then flinches upon seeing Zwei and Drei glaring at him scornfully ready to beat his ass."Yes, I am. I AM afraid, very afraid. And yes, even the thought of one of my girls being attacked in an attempt to get me, the shit scares the hell outta me!", Caleb stated as Mu Jin and the others were taken aback by the intensity in his voice. Caleb then takes a moment to calm himself, "But that doesn't mean i'll keep them hidden away with me. I want to prepare them to be able to function well in our society and live their lives however they want. I'm sure your host wants the same for you.", Caleb says as Rebecca, Hollo, and Min Jun give him intrigued and understanding looks as Mahkah nods to them approvingly."So in spite of the risks, I intend to spend as much time with my wards and teach them all I can and I don't care who or whatever comes our way! I trust in them and i'm going to protect them. I also trust in my bodyguards, the Zyklons, to have my back whenever I need it.", Caleb spoke look to Zwei and Drei.Both Zyklons pause for a moment taking in his words. A sudden warmth built up in their cores neither have felt before."Plus, trying to keep my wards indoors all day ain't gonna fly. Don't want them to go stircrazy on me. Especially not ol' big bad wolfie here", Caleb chuckles scratching Lyca's ear much to her delight as her tail beats against the ground."Haha I'm not bad Chief, just rowdy. I needs my runnin' space!", Lyca states before nuzzling his shoulder. Caleb giggles petting her head. Hollo watches them in thought.Mahkah smiles at them, "Haha, yeah I guess you have a point there."Hollo then approaches him, taps his shoulder and whispers in his ear. He glances at Lyca before nodding supportingly at her. Hollo then turns to Lyca and Caleb with smile."Excuse me Lyca's Alpha, I need to have with Lyca in the woods for a bit?", Hollo says as Zwei immediately turns her attention to them.Lyca ceases her nuzzling to look at her sister then to Caleb."Uhh, you can just call me 'Caleb' and that depends on her.", Caleb turns Lyca, " Lyca you wanna...""Of course!", Lyca hopping up to her feet."Well...alright, but listen don't go off too far now.", Caleb stated."It's fine, they'll just be slightly further up the trail. We've studied the area so it's pretty familiar now.", Mahkah affirmed."Ok, but still you should be careful never know what's crawling out in the grass.", Caleb advised."Ok. This won't take very long.", Hollo spoke before taking Lyca's paw in her's leading her out of the group."W-Wait! I think I should go as well to make sure they keep out of trouble.", Zwei stated rising from her seat."No! It's private stuff that's just between Lyca and me! No one else!", Hollo stated glaring daggers at Zwei."So what?! Its still dangerous like C.B. said. Besides you're not the only who has private chat with her you know.", Zwei defended.Hollo was about to retort but Lyca steps in, "It's fine Zwei. I'll be right back. Besides, I have my big sis with me to look out for me.""B-But I...", Zwei uttered with a slightly hurt tone."Zwei!", Caleb spoke up to the weasel girl, "Let Lyca go with her sister. You just stay here for now."Zwei was about to rebut but realizing her every effort would be futile she begrudgingly withdrew, "...fine.", she uttered before sitting back down folding her arms.With that, Hollo quickly pulled Lyca along going into a jog. The second they cross the road Hollo takes off on all fours with Lyca excitedly bounding off right behind her. Zwei watches with a despondent frown.Caleb watches them leave with slightly worried expression. He then feels something cold and hard touch his arm and looks to see Mahkah pressing a can of DD Pepper in each hand beaming a assuring grin."Hey, don't worry. Hollo is a lot more responsible than she looks I promise.", He says as Caleb politely takes the can."At least in scenarios like this one. Just...don't ask her to go shopping.", Rebecca added as she started putting away some of the cooking utensils. Min Jun cringes at the memory before entering his tent and going over to the Zyklons with a travel case."Yes...never again.", Mahkah cryptically says with expression of a man having a Vietnam flashback.Caleb pops the cap of his can deciding not to open that can of worms."Heyyy, you ladies wanna see something cool?", Min Jun spoke in a sly tone tapping his travel case tentalizingly."But I already own a mirror.", Drei comments. Zwei ignores him continuing to sulk.As sips the brown delicous carbinated liquid, he focuses his interest to the odd-looking necklace exposed on his shirt collar. It appeared to be made from leather ropes with red, yellow, black, and white marble beads and a circular pendant in the middle that had a sketch of an eagles eye. Caleb gives a pensive look at Mahkah wanting to confirm an earlier assumption he had."Hey, Mahkah, quick question?", Caleb spoke before politely muffling a burp in his fistMahkah turns to him, "Yeah?""Ahem, so I hope this isn't offensive, but...you wouldn't happen to be Porch Creek indian would you?", Caleb inquires as Rebecca turn to them curiously, "I mean, I just noticed that necklace and the hair and... ok now i'm feeling like an asshole.", Caleb trails feeling he's being rude."Hehe well your NOT one. Believe me, they're easy for me to spot.", Mahkah chuckles taking a sip and clearing his throat, "Anyway, No, I belong to the Lakota people from the Pine Ridge Indian reservation.""Wait, for real?! Isn't that the one up in like South Dakota or something? Whatcha'll doing all the way down here?", Caleb inquired with great intrigue."Hehehehehe, Yeah, that's the one. And that's...kind of long story but the supercut version of it is, my wards and I are doing some freelance work for ICEP.", Mahkah stated as Min Jun shows the Zyklons something on a laptop and eagerly explaining to them whatever was on the screen. Drei seemed intriuged while Zwei was only slight curious about it."Freelance work? What kind?", Caleb asks."We're essentially information brokers but there ARE a number of similar jobs ICEP has place for anyone looking for work. It could be providing job training assistance, Liminal research, or the like. In our case, ICEP can't quite keep track of exactly how many Liminals are actually in a country at a given time. Either due to illegal smuggling or because of poor recordings. So, they employ individuals like us to conduct surveys and collect data on them. They have huge emphasis on certain species that fall out the public eye. Then we offer them the option of getting registered into ICEP records where they gain the rights to either a homestay life or assistance from Interspecies Affairs. ICEP pays us for every newly registered person.", Rebecca explains before Min Jun holding the laptop up to Caleb. On it, was a map of the United States and Canada with a multitude of blue dots that showed pictures of different liminals faces."Damn, these are really all the places you've been?!", Caleb stated in surprise."Yeah, more or less. Many liminals aren't exactly within arms reach so we have to search everywhere some could be hiding out for whatever reason.", Mahkah explained."On rare occasion, it can be a little dangerous. Some liminals out there reallllly hate humans with a passion so we have to take some safety measures.", Min Jun explains pointing to some dots with pictures of liminals highlight in red text that said 'WARNING' in all caps, "Or we just get the hell outta there and call MON to handle it. Plus, we still get a finders fee.""We're sponsored by the program so we can pretty much conduct our research anywhere in the U.S. and Canada and it's pretty much open for anyone to sign up, even ICEP hosts. Though you DO have to buy your own equipment annnnd you forfeit any monthly stipends for homestays. They pay really well though. Espescially to workers like me in underrepresented groups.", Mahkah says pointing at himself as Min Jun goes back to the Zyklons, "We're visiting the Southern states right now to because we heard of Liminals being released by traffickers into parks and forests like these."Caleb listens intently, "Whoa that's cool, so you were already a host when you decided to do this?""Not...really. In fact, I wasn't even intending on joining the exchange let alone doing this. That was, until...", Mahkah trails off."Until what?", Caleb inquires."Until I met Hollo.", Mahkah says in a nostalgic tone, "Apparently, after her sister left their pack in Montana she went looking for her only to get captured by some smugglers. She escaped but got stranded got stranded in South Dakota. Then she got into a bit of trouble back on the reservation stealing food and almost attacking some people. I helped her out and kept her from harming anyone until MON arrived. They were going to put her into custody but...she just gave me these pleading eyes and I just...I just couldn't let them take her.", Mahkah spoke admittedly. Caleb immediately undersood what he meant. Is that a hereditary trait in Lyca's family or what? Zwei listens intently to the story."Then what?", Caleb inquired drinking more from his can."THEN an ICEP coordinator woman arrived. I pleaded for her to let me take care of Hollo. She then made me join ICEP and become her host family. The only thing was I couldn't keep her on the reservation because most people were still afraid she'd snap again. So, the coordinator offered us the job. It was rough in the beginning, really rough, but we soon found our footing and started making a decent living. Annnd Hollo became really attached to me and started calling us an 'Alpha couple'. I didn't mind it but I didn't take to her view on gender roles much. ", Mahkah spoke reminiscently, "We eventualy made our first stop into Quebec for a job. That's where we ran into Rebecca.""Ran into? How can you say that when it was clearly fate that brought us together Master?! You saved my life in that kerfuffle with those rowdy girl Orcs! ", Rebecca replies in a hurt tone."Hollo helped alot too you know. We were just lucky they share plenty of traits with actual pigs AND those wild boar sound repellers still worked.", Mahkah spoke insistantly."Even so, I knew right then you were the partner for me. Even if that loonie wolf had her claws in you already!", Rebecca stated assertively before hugging Mahkah close, her breasts mushing into his arm as her tail wags excitedly. Mahkah blushes looking off in embarassment.Caleb chuckles before looking over to Min Jun chatting it up with a seemingly less interested Drei, who's basically a hostage now, showing her different things on his laptop. Particularly, minecraft."Hehe, so what about Tails the Fox over there? What's his backstory?", Caleb chuckled finishing his drink before the two-tailed Inari's ears perk up hearing that comment."Oh, well...we kinda found him.", Mahkah admitted in a slight uneasy tone as Rebecca looks away in thought with a sullen expression."Found him?", Caleb inquires before Min Jun walks into view."I ran away actually.", he spoke holding his arm dejectedly, "There was this host lady I stayed with in Iowa and...she was really...controlling. If I stepped out of line, she'd hurt me, wouldn't feed me, or just locked in a room for days. Basically, I was nothing but a pet to her so...I ran away. Even though I didn't have anywhere to go."Caleb and the Zyklons listened in shock and anger."We found him sleeping outside. He told us everything that happened and we reported the lady to the police for liminal student abuse.", Mahkah stated with a hint of distaste."Hollo and I were going to give her a well-deserved beating but Master wouldn't allow it.", Rebecca chided crossing her arms."You BOTH would've been arrested. Iowa's human-liminal violence laws are a lot more rigid there.", Mahkah corrected" I...I am so sorry.", Caleb apologizes to Min Jun."Oh, i-it's fine man. That was over a year ago and I'm ok now.", Min Jun affirmed before turning to Mahkah, "it all turned out fine in the end. That woman is in prison now and Big Bro, Hollo, Rebecca became my new host family.", he says taking a seat next to Mahkah who proceeds to pat his head."Hey, so, you guys have been all around the U.S and Canada right? How long of you been doing this", Zwei inquires."I'd say almost two years now. And yes, we've been all over much of Canada and northwestern America so far. ", Mahkah answers."Whoa, that alot of ground to cover. I can't imagine what your travel costs are like.", Zwei says raising an eyebrow."Not as bad as you might think actually. ICEP usually reinburses us for gas.". Mahkah stated with a chuckle before noticing Caleb's pensive expression, "You ok man?""Yeah, I was just thinking, do you guys ever think about settling down anywhere? Maybe find a decent house to live in? I mean, don't you ever get homesick?",Caleb inquired.Mahkah and his wards think for a moment while Caleb wonders if he may have overstepped a bit."I admit that would be nice. But honestly, it doesn't really bother us. We get to see new places, try new foods, and meet new people while also helping give people like my wards a future to look forward to.", Mahkah spoke contently, "And yeah, I sometimes miss my friends and family back on the reservation but we keep in contact through Zoom chat everyday. They give me plenty of support and they've gotten used to all my wards; even Hollo. So I'm never really homesick, espescially with these guys around.""It doesn't matter where we go. We're all home as long as we're together with Master, eh?.", Rebecca says resting her head to Mahkah's shoulder."Ditto on that!", Min Jun adds before fist bumping his 'Big Bro'. He then takes his laptop to Drei; no doubt to talk about more Minecraft."Yeah, you guys are right about that.", Mahkah spoke caringly.Caleb smiles understanding what they meant before looking away pensively. His thoughts turning to his own family. He knew Uncle Junior and Vanessa basically accepted Mirabelle and the rest as part of his life. But, he wondered, what of the rest of his family? His brother? His sister? Neither of them even speak to him anymore? How would they react to the girls?"Now, I want to ask you something."Caleb jolts back to reality turning to Mahkah, "Huh? O-Oh, yeah, what is it?""Does Lyca ever talk about Hollo or their pack?"Zwei eyes widen before turning to them awaiting Caleb's response."Not really, I mean, she mentioned it a few times but she never really went into detail. I asked but it seemed like she never wanted to talk about her life before living with me.", Caleb admitted."I ask because Hollo talks about her all the time.", Mahkah says as Zwei listens intently. Drei"Really? What does she say?"Mahkah gives a sullen look, "Well, from what she says, Lyca didn't have the best time growing up. You know in Werewolf packs individuals gain respect based on their skills, strength, and cunning and they have a similar hierarchical structure as regular wolves.""Yeah, I'm familiar with it. Lyca told me herself she was the Omega in her pack. The lowest level in the entire structure.", Caleb spoke his voice growing colder, "I did some research online just to find out how bad life was for them but they don't really go into enough detail."Mahkah grumbles taking off his hat allowing his neck length black hair loose, "That's because it's omitted on purpose. Hollo talked about how Lyca always struggled in their pack to get stronger. But she was the runt of her litter and couldn't keep up with her siblings or the other pup litters. As they got older, her siblings and the other pups moved up in rank becoming Deltas, Betas, Epsilons, or leaving to start packs of their own, while she was stuck as the Omega. Hollo says she was harassed and bullied by them every single day, even by her own siblings, for little or to no reason. She ate nothing but whatever were leftover by her siblings. She became so malnourished and underweight she couldn't even hunt anymore!"Mahkah pauses as Caleb and Zwei wore shocked expressions before he resume, "Hollo was the only one of her siblings who, despite her higher rank, respected and cared for Lyca!""Well if THAT'S true, why didn't she stand up for her?! Why did she help her become stronger?! It kinda sounds like she sat back and did nothing while her sister suffered!", Zwei stated shooting to her feet, "If it were one of MY sisters-""ZWEI!", "HEY!", Caleb and Min Jun stated simultaneously making her pause for a moment before noticing Mahkah holding Rebecca back as the Kobold glared at her angrily. She then feels a hand on her shoulder and turns to see Drei with a serious look."That's enough.", Drei spoke.Zwei wordlessly sits back down looking away despondently. Drei attempts to pat her arm but Zwei whips her shoulder brushing her off."You're wrong you know.", Mahkah says plainly as Zwei slowly looks up, "Hollo did whatever was in her power as a Beta to help her. She shared her portion of food, stepped in whenever her pack mates went too far, and was just a friend whenever she was alone. She did all she could but she knew she was outnumbered. That if she bared her fangs to protect Lyca she'd have the rest of the pack baring theirs down on them both. It hurt her that she couldn't protect her and even more when found out Lyca left the pack without saying a word. For the last TWO YEARS she's been hoping and praying to see her again so don't say what YOU would've done when you barely know the full story!"Zwei is taken aback as she is struck speechless unable to respond."Well...i'm glad she was able to find her today.", Caleb says.Mahkah turns to Caleb his aggitation subsiding, "Yeah, you're right. I imagine the two of them have plenty to catch up on.""Yeah.", Caleb utters when a thought occurs to him, "Actually, how long has it been since they left? My phone's charger is messed up right now.""It's been two hours...annnd fifteen minutes.", Min Jun answered checking his laptop."An two hours a-what?! When, I-I mean how?! Shouldn't we go look for-", Caleb stated before being cut off"WAROOO!", howled Lyca and Hollo as they leapt out of the forest and came bounding on all fours toward the group barking excitedly. Zwei immediately turns her attention to them."See? They're fine. Told you Hollo could be trusted.", Mahkah smugly grinned."Yeah yeah", Caleb spoke admittedly as Lyca and Hollo started running making circles around the group, "Whoa! Whoa! Calm down Lyca!""You too Hollo! You're gonna knock something or someone over!", Mahkah stated.Both werewolves stop right in front of their respective hosts. Their eyes sparkling with excitement and tails wagging a million...wags a second."Cheif!", "Master!", both of them stated simultaneously."That's me. What's up?" Caleb inquires"What is it Hollo?", Mahkah spoke."We just had the best idea! Our packs are gonna form an alliance!", Hollo stated happily."But first, we're all gonna a race together!", Lyca stated excitedly.Caleb and Zwei along with Mahkah, Rebecca, and Min Jun go silent as they collectively absorbed what they said.Drei closes Min Jun's lap top, "Well, this is getting interesting."WRSUP FAM! Well here I am again as promised, I hope you enjoyed the chapter. Now, looks like I haven't gotten better at brevity as my chapters tend to be much longer than initially intended. What can I say I'm a stickler for detail, character growth, and world building. This date was meant to be two chapters long for Pete sake now it's gonna be four because I had the BRILLIANT IDEA TO focus on two different groups at once. So I was like f*k it, let call this the "Lyca Date Arc" because that's what it is now, an arc. I pray to the non-denominational diety that Camilla's date won't suffer the same fate ( heh, that rhymed). Anyway special thanks to my now honorary proofreader Sandshrew master 37 for helping me with the narrative and my shitty grammar. Welp, that's about it. Stay safe, stay beautiful(in my eyes), stay reading, stay following and stay faving; this is GoatMan saying, PEACE FAM!P.S. Mahkah Cox's character was actually based off a real life friend of mine who is actually Porch Creek indian but just changed the name a little and made him a different tribe. Which he was cool with btw. Actually his birthday is this Thursday, so this is like a pseudo birthday gift. K BYE!
  
    Chapter Text
    Chapter 29: Finish LineA gentle breeze blowing throughout the forest. The sound rustling of the trees and foliage along lining thev rocky nature trail with the sunlight peaking it's late afternoon rays through the white fluffy clouds. The trickle flow of the pristine Black Warrior stream along the tree lining. Two men stood in the middle of this beautiful scenery. Mahkah Cox doing his warm-up stretches and muttering something in another language and Caleb doing his own stretches and wondering how the hell he got here.Seriously, wasn't this just supposed to be a date?! Why is he having a tag team race with Lakota Indian man and his three canine liminals?He begins mentally retracing his steps.***30 minutes earlier***"What the hell are you two talking about?!", Caleb uttered incredulously."I'm with him. What?!", Zwei added equally if not MORE confused."It's very simple! Both of our packs are going to form an alliance with each the other. That way Lyca and I will always be together and we'll be our pack's strength will increase!", Hollo stated."Big sis says she and her pack aren't going to be around this territory very long so we came up with this challenge for our packs to unify over!", Lyca explained"Ok, but why a race though?", Mahkah inquires curiously"Or, just 'why?' period.", Caleb interjects, "If it's about wanting to stay in touch, we can do that. You said you got Zoom right? I use it for work all the time, we can just do that.""Noooo, that's not how it works! In order for packs to form an alliance, they must compete in a competition to test each other's skills and prowess. How else can we be sure who the weakest and strongest members are?", Hollo stated emphatically."Ask them if water is wet and wait for the dumbest answer?", Drei inquire tilting her head.Caleb gives her a blank look as the rest look to her curiously; a few of them beginning to let the gears turn in their heads over her question. Caleb decided to shut that down now."Ok! Ok! Look, I get this is Werewolf society thing but I hardly feel this is necessary or likely to prove anyone's strengths here. I mean, aside from who's fastest and you two sho'nough got beat.", Caleb stated gesturing between Lyca and Hollo."Oh, it's alright Chief. We know humans aren't fast enough to keep up with us.", Lyca spoke honestly."Plus, we have a plan for that. Lyca told me how you've been struggling to keep up with her your whole date but you still wouldn't give up despite being a little overweight.", Hollo added with no malice or sarcasm in her voice." And he didn't even pass out once. I thought he would the first eleven times, but he soldiered on like true American...walking to burger king.", Drei commented in the most patriotic voice."ALRIGHT, DAMN! When did this turn into a roast on ME?!", Caleb stated startling a few of them before refocusing on Hollo, "Shit, now what where sayin'? Something about a plan?""Yes!", Hollo emphatically stated bouncing slightly, " It's gonna be a three person tag race. Lyca and I pick two from each of our groups. We tag a pack mate at a point on the race path and the first person to cross the starting point again wins!""We know the perfect path too! The first pair will start right over on the tail near camp, then they'll tag the second pair at the bend near the last rest stop ahead, then they tag the last team where the make their way back to the starting line.", Lyca explains."Yeah, that's good you guys thought this out but that still doesn't mean we're just gonna drop everything and race around like we're in middle school.", Caleb replies incredulously."Actually, I could go for a good run right about now. We Kobold love excersie almost as much as our loved ones!", Rebecca admitted with a hint of excitement."Excuse me?", Caleb inquires"It IS a nice day. I think it could be fun way for all of us to bond. Plus, I think the extra cardio would do me some good.", Mahkah added in support."Hahaha, that's the spirit Master! Nothing like a good workout to really bring people together, eh?", Rebecca chuckling proudly but gently patting Mahkah's back being careful not to cut him with her claws."Well YOUR definition of a 'workout' is a 20 mile marathon from A to B and back to A. If it was one of those I'd have said no because I would definitely die.", Mahkah stated and shudders from the thought of it."Ah! I would NEVER do that to you Master!",Rebecca spoke apologetically.Caleb gives them surprised looks having hoped that at least MAHKAH would side with him."You guys can count me out of this one. I just ate sooooo much quail so I'm not up for any excessive physical exertion right now. I'll just hang back and guard the campsite.", Min Jun says resting his arms over his head leaning back to look cool only to realize there was no back support to his seat and goes tumbling backwards to the ground, "I'm ok!", he stated holding a thumbs up. Mahkah shakes his head with a grin as Drei gives an unamused look."Cool, Master and Rebecca are on my team!", Hollo cheers proceeding to happily hug and lick both her pack mates.Caleb watches amazed at how it weird it is looking at that from the outside."Ok, so now Lyca just needs to pick her-", Hollo started but was interrupted by Zwei."I'm on Lyca's team!", Zwei stated as everyone turned their attention to her standing in her seat arm raised like an attention-seeking kid in middle school, "I'll race with her!", she spoke in a determined tone shooting a look at Hollo."Alright Zwei! Let's do our best!", Lyca says holding both hands up.Zwei smirks and gives Lyca a High Ten, "Yeah!"She turns to Hollo with a cocky smirk who simply tilts her head questioningly."I'll stay behind. One of us has to watch the campsite.", Drei stated nonchalantly."Uhh I'm here too you know.", Min Jun interjects. Drei pauses with a blank stare."One of us has to watch the campsite.", Drei reaffirms. Min Jun grumbles as Mahkah and his wards giggle.Suddenly Lyca appears right in front of him startling him a bit."Pleeeeesae Chief!?", Lyca pleaded with her signature bright Amber puppy eyes, "There's no point if YOU don't do it too! I want us to compete together as real mates. We are mates right?"Caleb blushes slightly at her tone glancing at Mahkah and his wards hoping they didn't misunderstand what she meant, "Lyca...it's not...we just..."He looks into those soft canine eyes as she begins to whimper just for good measure. He then notices the rest of the camp staring at him expectantly before sighing relentingly. Peer pressure is a bitch."Hahh Fine! I'll race too dammit.", Caleb submits as Lyca perks up wrapping her arms around his neck proceeding to lick his neck sweetly. He tries in vain to pry her off."huh, so that's what that looks like from the outside.", Mahkah mutters to himself."ALRIGHT! It's settled! We both have our teams and Jun and the small cat lady will watch camp and be the judges.", Hollo stated."Still a weasel and thanks something else to add to my resume.", Drei commentedCaleb sighs to himself still holding Lyca's tongue lapping face away.****Flashback over****'Nope, still doesn't make any sense.', Caleb thought while cursing himself for giving into peer pressure and those damned adorable eyes of Lyca's. Honestly, he was grateful that at least he wasn't racing against anyone one of the liminals since there's no way he'd ever beat them in a race on foot.'Although, on the other hand...", Caleb thought sarcastically then looking over to Mahkah who was doing lunges. Since he changed into some lighter clothes consisting of loose fitting cargo shorts, sneakers, and a yellow men's tank top Caleb got a better look at the man's lean, well-defined physique. He looked more like fitness trainer than a damn information broker. Caleb grumbles lowly realizing standing next to each other like this they basically looked like a before and after image from Weight Watchers."Hey, uhh Mahkah?", Caleb inquires holding a squatting position as Mahkah continues his legs stretch but turns to him."Yeah?""You...wouldn't have happened to have ran track when you were younger did you?", Caleb inquires listening for his answer.Mahkah gives a curious look, "Uhh nope. I don't really like track sports.""Ah. Okay then.", Caleb says feeling a tiny bit better about himself."I mean, I DID play football from sophomore to senior year in high school.", Mahkah spoke earning a panicked look from Caleb, "What about you?""Uhhh, nope. Wasn't really into sports growing up.", Caleb admitted."Really, you kinda look like you could be playing right now.", Mahkah spoke honestly."People always assume that about hefty-looking black men but looks can be deceiving.", Caleb says in slight annoyance, "I honestly prefer not to talk about that with Lyca or the rest of the girls.""Hehe, smart. I told Hollo and Rebecca about it and now they try to make me play a game of football any chance they get. That, ON TOP, of forcing me workout with them but what can you do when ya got two energetic kobold species.", Mahkah shrugs nonchalantly with a chuckle."Hahaha y-yeah, lucky I only got ONE hehehhhh...", Caleb trails of as it sinks in just how fucked he his. More fucked than a Ditto in daycare. If his nature hike with Lyca was a testament to his physical fitness then his leg of the race will likely end with him collapsed halfway through wheezing for air. He could just back out but he couldn't disappoint or embarass Lyca. Alternatively, he could muster every bit of energy he has left to try his hardest to win and STILL lose but at least he'll embarass her, but most of all HIMSELF, a little less. He clenches his teeth growling annoyance at letting things her so complicated.Back at camp, the first racing pair were taking their positions at the makeshift starting/finish line on the trail out of two sticks and a long bandage strip. Drei and Min Jun stood on either side of the trail while Lyca and Rebecca stood got in their sprinting positions."Ok, I want a nice clean race( or as clean as you get away with). Orders have been determined at random hat drawing. First leg, is between Lyca and Rebecca. Second leg, between Zwei and Hollo. Third leg, between Caleb and Mahkah. Not sure why I told you stuff you already know, I guess I don't give a shut enough to be theatrical.", Drei commented hiding her indifference."Uh, Ms. Drei, can we please start now my arms are getting tired.", Min Jun implored holding his hands together clutching a swirling yellow ball of energy as his arms trembled, "Charging my...*grunt* fox fire like this...is really exhausting."Drei gives him a dry look then looks to Lyca and Rebecca who were both ready to start, "Alright. On your marks, get set, go. Launch the thing.", she said finished pointing to Min Jun and Lyca and Rebecca took off a sprinting."Gah!", Min Jun elicits before firing the ball of energy high above the trees. It exploded like a firework forming the shape of a yellow glowing cartoon fox head. Min Jun panted in relief flopping his arms to loosen his stiff muscles."Hey!", Drei called poking her head out from one of the tents, "You have any other meat in here that ISN'T quail or hotdogs?!"Elsewhere, the other racers are noticing the starting signal....Zwei and Hollo stand near the upper section of the trail closest to the one of the rest areas. They both look up to see the giant yellow cartoon fox face before it slowly pettered out."Looks like sis and Rebecca have started!", Hollo stated pumping her fist then pointing to Zwei with a challenging smirk, "I hope you're ready for this! I don't plan to lose!""Too bad! Almost nothing in life goes as planned so get ready to be disappointed mutt! I'm not losing to you.", Zwei retorted shooting an unflinching glare before turning her back to her. Despite her declaration, she was worried if she could back up her assertion as it was agreed she wouldn't use any of her wind-based abilities.Hollo gives a confused look noticing her body language and tone were strangely aggressive."Hey, Zwei, you really like my sister don't you?", Hollo inquired much to Zwei's surprise, "You seem really be close to her and she seems to think highly of you. I'd just like to know why."Zwei refuses to look her way and crosses her, "Look. not that it matters to you, but we just understand each other. She gets me in way even my own sisters don't. In a way only my...my dad...", her voice slightly cracks.She then notices Hollo staring wide eyed in concern, "L-Let's just focus on the race Ok?!""S-Sure.", Hollo spoke deciding not to press further...Caleb and Mahkah look up to see the cartoony fox light spectacle."Ok, they've started. You ready for this man?", Mahkah spoke limbering himself up more."Haahhh, about as ready as I can get.", Caleb replies as the two of them face the direction they expect their teammate to come from. Caleb wonders how Lyca was doing right now....The family of five from before were walking down the trail enjoying their stroll and doing a little bird watching. The wife stood near the trail edge with one if the little boy's hands pointing at turtles swimming along the river while the teenage daughter tweeted pictures if them on her phone. The husband had one of his sons next to him as the little tyke surveyed the area through his dad's binoculars. The little boy leans forward."Daddy, look at the big doggies!", The little boy innocently pointed as the wife smiled at them."Big dogs?", The man playfully inquired before politely taking the binoculars, "Where? I do seeYAAAHHHHHH!", the man shouts to top of his lungs upon seeing Lyca and Rebecca barreling towards them before falling backwards on his butt. The two canine liminal perform a vertical leap right over the man and son as the mother, sons, and daughter looked on in shock and amazement."Sorry!", "Excuse us, Sorry!", Lyca and Rebecca stated simultaneously leaving the family behind as the wife checked on her passed out husband."Bye doggies", the little boys says waving at them before being joined by his brother.Lyca and Rebecca were neck in neck with each other both of them giving it the best their four legs can put out. Rebecca looks at Lyca out the corner of her eye seeing the She-wolf sprinting with the ferocity of a wild predator in pursuit of prey. Seeing Lyca so wild, natural, and uninhibited; it was exhilarating. Is this what all wolves are like? If so, she liked it, alot."WOOAARRRRFFF! HAHAHAHAAAAA", Rebecca barked loudly and excitedly.Lyca was confused but joins her anyway, "AWWOOOOO! WOOOO! THIS RACE IS OURS BABY!""YOU WISH! JUST TRY AND PASS ME!", Rebecca stated enthusiastically."GLADLY!", Lyca taunts putting in a bit more gusto.Suddenly, they could both see Zwei and Hollo in the distance."Come on Lyca! You can do it! Tag me! TAG ME!", Zwei stated holding out her palm."YOU CAN DO IT REBECCA! You can do it, don't give up!", Hollo encourage holding out her palm.Motivated by their teammates, both girls pushed forward determined to secure their team's place in the lead. Rebecca pulls up in front of Lyca keeping the she-wolf from passing her as Hollo cheered in support. Refusing to let her team down and driven by Zwei's shouts of encouragement, Lyca pulls out the last bit of gusto she had. She bounds a couple times before launching herself towards Zwei straight over Rebecca. Time appears to slow to a crawl as Rebecca, Hollo, and Zwei look on in shock. Lyca raises her hand and the millisecond she was in arms length of Zwei she slaps her hand. Zwei then takes off running giving a quick 'Good work' as Lyca tucks her head in into her stomach rolling into the dirt. Rebecca slaps Hollo's hand and the she-wolf takes off after the wily wind weasel. Hollo glances back like with a grin of admiration.Lyca and Rebecca are left panting in exhaustion with the former having a proud grin on her face." *pant* *pant* haaaa...wow...haaaa your really fast.", Rebecca panted as she hunched over trying to catch her breath." haaa ghaaaa...you haaa too...that was fun.", Lyca panted her chest rising and falling as she lay sprawled on her back."Ah...you wolves...you're something else, eh?", Rebecca uttered."Heheh *pant*...thanks.", Lyca giggles before Rebecca joins.As the two of them rest before returning to camp, Zwei was busy trying to keep ahead of Hollo. She sprinted with the style and grace of a ninja (Naruto run) as Hollo ran on all fours slowly gaining on her.Zwei looks to her right in dismay as Hollo catches up to and eventually pulls ahead of her."You're too slowwww! Bye-Bye little weasel!", Hollo taunts before sprinting further ahead as Zwei scowls in annoyance.She raises her arms tempted to use her wind techniques to give herself a speed boost but she knew if she did they'd automatically lose. She didn't want to humiliate Lyca. Dammit, why did Drei have to go the extra mile and TELL her to be wary of any uncharacteristically strong breezes. Whatsmore, her stamina sucks compared to either of her sister's so she knew she can't keep up this pace for long.'Shit, at this rate she'll have tagged her teammate before I even get there!', Zwei cursed internally as the grey she-wolf continues to widen the distance between them. She had to do something to turn things around and quick and is once again tempted to give herself a subtle speed boost hoping the wolf wouldn't notice. She shamefully raises her arm up prepared to make her move. Suddenly, she notices the trees around the trail were becoming thicker with outstretching branches lining above. Zwei smirks lowering her arm.Ahead of her, Hollo smiles upon catching Mahkah's scent realizing she was very close to sealing their win. She looks back to see how far away the weasel was only to find she was nowhere in sight. Not even a glimpse of her trying to catch up. Did she leave her that far behind? She slows her pace to a trot becoming a bit concerned."WHAT'S WRONG?! Paws getting tired?!", Zwei statedHollo looks upwards and is shocked to see the weasel leaping from tree branch to tree branch like a true ninja. She was simultaneously impressed and annoyed upon seeing she was getting ahead of her. She increases her pace again going into a full sprint."HEY, THAT'S NOT FAIR! Your sister said NO wind power stuff!", Hollo complained."I'm not! I'm just using my stealth training to it's fullest potential! Besides, I'm still technically ON the trail aren't I?", Zwei chortled mischievously while effortlessly leaping ahead."Heh, guess we should've been more specific!", Hollo chuckled welcoming the challenge.The two raced along coming essentially neck and neck. Ahead, both of them could make out the two humans waiting to be tagged by them.Zwei then notices the lining of tree limbs cuts off just several meters from where she could've landed in front of Caleb. She curses her luck but still decides on a plan. At the right moment with the right momentum at the right angle, she'll use that final branch for all it's worth.Ahead, Mahkah notices Hollo sprinting towards him."Hollo! I'm here come on! Come on, Hol you can do it!", he shouted in encouragement.Caleb looks ahead but doesn't see Zwei running alongside."Zwei?! ZWEI WHERE ARE YOU?!", Caleb shouted fearing he's going to get so far behind waiting for her."Master!", Hollo shouted back shifting to two-legged sprinting stretching her arm out."BOOOSSSSSS!", Shouted the voice of Zwei. Caleb's eyes widen in shock seeing Zwei flying towards him arm stretched back either like she's about to give a badass high five or the sickest dunk ever. Even Mahkah and Hollo were both caught off guard."WHAT THE FUCK?!", Caleb stated instinctively putting his palms up in defense. Time slows as Hollo and Zwei inch ever closer to their humans before...*slap*, both girls tag their partners at the same time. Zwei somersaults to the ground before sliding to a haunt on her feet. Mahkah hesitates a seconds taking in what happened before turning and running away leaving a still dazed Caleb standing there.Zwei notices and immediately turns to him and shouts, "DON'T JUST STAND THERE. GET GOING! *SLAP*", before slapping him on the butt."GAH! OK! DAMN!", Caleb stated before taking off as fast as he could after Mahkah."*pant* *pant* That...that was so cool haaaaa...I was...a little worried about you...haa for a minute. But...your way stronger than I thought.", Hollo praised while trying to catch her breath.Zwei pants in exhaustion giving a quizzical look at Hollo, "T-Thanks...haaa you're pretty strong too. Haa...haa...and now...haaa we leave it to our human teammates.""I just know master's gonna win!", Hollo stated in a certainty."Ha, please, Boss has got this!", Zwei replied confidently but, in the back of her mind, she knew it was probably a lie. The BMI gap between him and Caleb is wider than Camilla's hips.Zwei plops down on the ground to rest before examining the hand she slapped Caleb with still feeling the sensation on her fingertips, 'Dang, that felt pretty good. No wonder Marequines' always checking it out.', she thought with a sultry smirk.It was now the last leg of the race and Caleb and Mahkah were running down the trails like two high school in physical ed. Mahkah had pull an early lead but Caleb was able to catch up to him; much to the latter's surprise. They were neck and neck passing along the flowing stream to the left and rocky terrain to the right. Barely halfway into their race, Caleb was already starting to feel out of breath. His heart pounded in his chest as his breathing grew more laborious with every time his feet strike the ground. His pace begins to slow but still tries his best to not lose contact with Mahkah.Mahkah notices Caleb struggling a bit and was tempted to slow his own pace. However, he also sees he was still doing his absolute best to win and did not want to sully the man's dignity by denying him HIS best efforts. It would go against his tribal core values. He increases his pace while managing his breathing and gradually puts more and more distance between him and Caleb.Caleb looks as the Lakota man leaves him behind seemingly barely breaking a sweat while he looked like he was knocking on heaven's door. His pace slows down considerably and his ears rang from the blood rapidly pumping to his head. As he watches Mahkah put more and more distance between them he couldn't help feeling...inadequate.'How else can we be sure who's the strongest and weakest?', Hollo's words play in his mind. If he loses, does that make HIM the weakest? Even when the Lyca and Zwei tried so hard?He looks ahead of him as Mahkah gets further and further out of sight. He's going to win. Caleb knew that from the start. The man does workouts like this for his wards on a regular basis for god sake! Besides, he said himself this race was pointless that didn't change their relationship with Mahkah's group. That's right, this a pointless race.So why... *wheeze**strike*...why was...*wheeze* *strike*...'WHY DOES THAT PISS ME OFF SO MUCH?!', Calen screams internal as he ran with all he had wheezing from his lungs burning in his chest and heels striking the dirt. Yes, this WAS a pointless race yet it did prove something. Earlier, he proclaimed that he would protect his wards no matter what comes their way. How can he do that if he can barely run a short distance without gasping for breath?! He thought of the look of unwavering trust in Lyca's eyes. The same eyes Moon Pie would give him. The eyes that see what he is unable to see.As he ran for all he had, the hoof mark on his chest beginning to glow along with his pupils giving off a purple hue. Lyca views him so highly. She believes in him. At this moment, deep in his pounding heart, he resolved to be the man she sees him as even if he's blind to it! No matter what, he's crossing that goddamn finish line!Caleb's adrenaline spikes as his second wind hits. His eyes take on a brighter purple hue and neon purple aura pulsates from his body as he transitions from a run to a full sprint leaving a trail of purple light behind. The burning of his lungs and the ringing in his ears became an afterthought as he focuses on his goal. Soon, he was able to see Mahkah again, still running but with a slightly slower pace. The finish line was up ahead. Lyca, Hollo and the rest of them could be heard cheering and shouting in the distance. Mahkah ran with all he had coming very close crossing the finish line while Caleb was a staggering amount of distance behind him.Caleb grit his teeth refusing to humiliate Lyca like this. He focused on Mahkah position."C-COME ON!", Caleb screamed internally. The second his foot struck the ground ...zoom... he finds himself several feet from his former position. Not even fully processing it, Caleb instinctively tries it again ...zoom... and he's teleported several more feet.At the makeshift toilet paper finish line, Hollo, Rebecca and Min Jun are seen cheering as Mahkah ran towards them about to secure their team's victory. Lyca and Zwei wore concerned expressions as Caleb was incredibly far behind. Drei sat watching from atop a tree surveying for him. Her eyes then widen in shock."YOU GOT THIS BRO!", Min Jun shouted encouragingly."JUST A LITTLE FURTHER COME ON MASTER!", Rebecca and Hollo cheered.Zwei and Lyca looked at then back to the trail."Crap, did we push him too hard? I hope he didn't pass out somewhere.", Zwei stated not liking the idea finding her boss unconcious in woods. She then notices Lyca giving a very worried expression, "I-I mean maybe his uhhh shoelaces probably came untied and he just stopped to the them! Yeah! That's plausible!"Lyca clenches her fists before cupping her hands to her mouth, "YOU CAN DO IT CHIEF!", she shouted to the top of her lungs earning looks from Hollo and the rest.Suddenly, Drei leaps down landing beside them before handing Zwei her binoculars."Ummm, you guys might want to check this o-", before Drei could finish and to everyone's shock, Caleb suddenly teleports out of nowhere right beside Mahkah. The young Lakota man looks in profound astonishment at, not only seeing Caleb catch up with him so quickly, but seeing the purple electrical sparks pulsating from his body as he sprinted by.Caleb eye's narrow at the finish line some twenty feet away. He strikes his foot to the ground ...zoom... and teleports right in the middle of Lyca and the rest of the group causing them to jump back in surprise. Mahkah slows his pace before coming to a complete stop utterly speechless. Caleb turns to the finish line, bends down and rips the white strip and sticks from the ground as the aura around his body dissipates and his eyes return to normal." *wheeze* *wheeze* I...*wheeze*...I win.", Caleb gasped before flopping down on his butt panting in exhaustion.Everyone stood in dumb silent unsure of what to say. Lyca smiles widely in admiration."HOORAY! YOU DID CHIEF! WE WON! WEWONWEWONWEWON!", Lyca cheered Caleb to the ground roughly nuzzling his chest. Caleb gasps struggling to try an pry her off his sweaty body."Ah! Lycs, wait! At least let the man breath for a second!", Zwei stated trying to stop Lyca from nuzzling Caleb to death.Mahkah approaches his wards as they exchanged questioning gazes."Hey, Caleb?", Mahkah spoke as Zwei finally prys Lyca off of Caleb. The latter props himself up with his arms turning to Mahkah, "How did you do that?"Zwei and Lyca ceases their struggle as Hollo and the rest of the group look to Caleb expecting answers; to which Caleb had.****Back at Mirabelle's group****"~ohhhhhh, how lovely!", "IN-deeed! Quite the impeccably delightful arr-ANGE-ment I have seen!~", the Monarch-winged and Pink Papillons both swoon admiring the bouquet arrangement Mirabelle created. It was a stunning display of purple cosmos surrounding white tulips with a single blue candytuft in the center. The Nightmare blushes sheepishly at their compliments. Since she's been over her, she been admiring the vast assortments of flowers and herbs. So much, she began noticing certain defects some of the plants; mostly dried leaves, damaged stems, and a few wilting. However, what really impressed the Papillon were her uncanny bouquet arranging skills."Hehe, th-thank you but it's nothing to make a fuss over.", Mirabelle spoke."~NONSENSE!~", stated the pink Papillon taking Mirabelles hand and looking her straight in the eye, "~You have a WON-derful talent for gardening!~""~The compassion and attention you've shown to the flowers we have call-OUS-ly neglected warms my heart. It truuuuly brings a tear to my eye witness such...tenderness.~, Monarch-wings insisted before taking Mirabelle's other hand, "~Theeeeese are the tender hands of a true maiden of nature; So de-LI-cate yet...so strong and...nurturing.~", she spoke sensually stroking her palm while Pinky caresses her other handing looking as though she's about to kiss it.Mirabelle cringes and blushes deeply before recoiling her arms holding them securely to her chest, "W-WELL! T-T-Thank you...for u-um...y-yes.""OH my goodness, this is beautiful!", came the deep Southern voice of a female customer. Mirabelle and the two Papillon turn to see caucasian woman gushing over the bouquet Mirabelle put together, "Now, I am having brunch tomorrow with the girls and this would be the PERFECT centerpiece!"Monarch turn to the woman with a smile, "~Ohh yes, that one was actually put together by Ms...ummm~", she tilts her head in thought realizing she never ask her name."M-Marequine. Mirabelle Marequine.", The Nightmare muttered."Well ma'am, I have to say you do amazing work. So do I pay you or do I go to that the stand?", the female customer praised before opening up her pocket book."I-I-I don't actually work-", Mirabelle stuttered before Monarch-wing jumps in."~Ohhh right this way ma'am! I can cer-TAIN-ly take of you. I'm Mandarin, you see, and might I say you have a FIRST-rate eye for presentation.~", Mandarin spoke fluttering her wings making sparkling orange dust sprinkle off. The customer blushes and smiles."Oh w-well now huhu...lead the way ma'am.", the customer giggles bashfully before following Mandarin to make her purchase. Leaving Mirabelle alone with Pinky.Mirabelle notices Pinky grinning sweetly at her and nervously averts her eyes, "W-Well I suppose I should get back to looking.""Ohhhh? What ex-AC-tly were you looking for before you got...distracted?", Pinky inquires in an uncomfortably lecherous tone."N-Nothing in particular just...", Mirabelle trails of before fidgeting and blushing."A present, perhaps? Perhaps for...a partner?", She swoons flashing a grin at Mirabelle.Mirabelle's blushes red as a tomato, "W-W-Well i-i-i-it's...u-uh ummm...", she stutters unable to deny the fact she wanted to bring something nice back for Caleb. What, exactly, she didn't know. Suddenly, Pinky takes her hand snapping her to attention."Don't worry, d-AR-liiing, follow me. I know ex-ACT-ly what you need.", Pinky spoke with a wink, "My name is Bae-Bae, you see.", Bae-Bae chuckles sultrily.'Of bloody course it is.', Mirabelle thought critically before eliciting a yelp as Bae-Bae hurries her along towards the stand of assorted trinkets and jars of colorful liquids.Over at the Alraune shop, Ein could be seen watching Mirabelle getting pulled away by the Pink Alraune. She winces slightly hoping she would be ok. She then looks to Camilla and Cheryl looking around the ready-made sculptures with the former intentionally keeping a far away and ignoring the latter as possible. Ein resumes around at the several humans and liminals entering are to view wares or just passing through. She had taken this spot since it allowed perfect view of everyone walking around. She was taking extra precaution to watch for any suspicious or strange behavior. So far, things were normal. Well, ASIDE from-"~Here kitty kitty~", came the voice of the Alraune in a noticeable French accent. Ein elicits a lengthy annoyed sigh, "Awww, what is wrong big kitty? Are you not feeling well?~""~Oh? Is ze kitty upset dear Bella? Oh bon sang(French for 'oh goodness'), ze poor kitty.", The other Alraune spoke sadly while accepting payment for the candies from a customer. Ein elicits a low weasel growl."For the last time, I. Am. Not. A. CAT!", Ein snarled in annoyance startling a two customers into turning the other way. While this location was great for observation, she unfortunately attracted the attention of the two Alraune attendance. Both of whom greatly adore feline liminals and haven't stopped bothering her yet somehow still able to efficiently service their clientele. However, the worst part for Ein was-"~oh kitty chérie (sweetheart kitty), are you certain you do not wish to partake in any of our confectionery treats?~", spoke Bella, the Alraune in the blue and yellow polka-dot flower, presenting a green pouch wrapped with yellow ribbon and filled with chewy juice-filled candies. Ein tenses at the intoxicating sweet aroma. Her eyes dart around to the other multicolored bags of sweet delight. Temptation is a bitch.Ein gulps nervously before averting her eyes, "N-No, I told you that's QUITE alright! I n-need to stay sharp and...uh...f-focused!", She retorts turning het back to them. In truth, she really, REALLY didn't want to go over her calorie count for today. She was already feeling guilty enough having overindulging herself at the cafe'. Her devastating revelation with the bathroom scale a couple days ago still haunted her subconsciously."~Ohhhh I see, kitty cherie. Zu have a more refined pallete, no?~", the red and yellow tipped petal Alraune does a crossing motion with her arms. The vines of the table unravel creating a small opening revealing an assortment of beautifully decorated French-style dessert with plant features. Ein eyes widen as her mouth watered from the tantalizing yet inviting aroma of sweetness. The Alraune flashes her a sultry grin, "~Oho bien regardez ici(well looky here), ze kitty is intrigued. I made these myself. Green tea croissant with nectar jelly filling Go on, try a morsel. ", she spoke presenting a small green croissant with orange jam-like substance oozing out the hole. Ein swallows hard the delicious aroma filling her nostrils and the Alraune with her beckoning, warm demeanor pulling her in like gravity."~Oho, don't be shy kitty cherie, just take a little nibble. Adelaide's croissants are simply delectable.~", Bella encourages as accepts money from two female customers in exchange for herbal cakes and fruits then waving goodbye with delighted grin. She then picks up one of the fruits, "Incidentally, you should also try this delicious treat of people, Le fruit des prisonniers, or, as you say, 'Prisoners fruit'. Once you taste, you will never have enough. Come, partake of the fruit kitty cherie~"Both Alraune extend their bodies over the counter presenting the treats to Ein. The nectar glistens on their cleavage and they advance on her with sultry grins.'Vile temptesses!', Ein screams in her head biting her lip and defiantly turning her head away putting her hands up defensively."N-No thank you. I'm s-supposed to be on a diet anyway!", she refuses waving them off hoping for a diversion. She got one."Excuse us!", came a male voice. Ein and both Alraune looks to see three young men, two Caucasian, one black, and one Asian. One of the Caucasian guys steps up with a grin looking to his friends who smiled eagerly."I uhh...I came to pick some more of that fruit you got. It's real good, I gave some of your fruits to my buddies here!", spoke the Caucasian guy."That's the best damn thing I EVER had! Y'all sell'em by the pound? I'll take like...five of them mugs.", the black guy stated."Seven for me!", stated the other Caucasian guy taking out his wallet.The Alraune pull back beaming delighted grins at the young men."~Merveilleux( How wonderful)! Of course, Monsieur, there is plenty for all of you.", Adelaide spoke with an adorable giggle."~Since you were so kind enough to spread the word of our confections, allow us ze pleasure of giving you only ze sweetest and...ripest of fruit.~", Bella spoke sweetly hugging waist giving a good view of her green breasts covered in glistening nectar. The young men grin with a couple biting their lips hungrily.Ein sighs in relief stepping away as the men proceed to list their desired confections. She sees them giggling and chatting with Alraune already knowing they were here for more than JUST the treats and decides to keep tabs and them as well. Don't need them getting TOO friendly. Ein returns to her sentry duties watching the patrons actions closely until..."~Tralalaaaaaaaa!~",came the singsongy voice."Oh no.", Ein muttered dreadfully looking to see a Papillon fluttering over to the Alraune stand. She had an outfit similar to Valerie's but with magenta color scheme, striped magenta and white wings, D-cup breasts with tiny freckles on top and on her cheeks. Sparkling magenta dust emanated from her wings as her feet touch the ground."~So sorry to bother my dear A-Del-aide and Bella, but dear Valerie has asked to procuuuure more nectar for strawberry sunrise oillll.~ Might I trouble you for some?~", Magenta Papillon spoke."~Ahh, but of course Megan darling! It is no bother at all. Ve only need a moment to satisfy out beloved clientelle.~", Adelaide assured petting the Asian man head who smiles like a goofball . The other men sat their large baskets down and blissfully eating some of the delicious fruit. Not even bothering to wash them off."~Ohh splendid! Are you sweeeeethearts enjoying out contemporary's mar-VEL-ous confectioneries?", Megan the Magenta Papillon hummed leaning in giving a good view of cleavage."Yes ma'am!", "Hell yeah we is!", "Oh yeah, yeah definitely!", "Please take all my money.", all four men voice simultaneously with wide grins and their eyes darting up and down.Ein sighs in annoyance shaking her head. Megan notices and grins turning to her."~Ohh huhuhu, pardon meeee miss but you're facing the wrong wa-ayyyy. The confections are right here.~", Megan spoke sweetly gesturing to the collection of sweets."My sense of direction is fine. I'm just not interested, thank you.", Ein spoke in serious tone returning to her post."~Not interested? Is there something wronnng?~", Megan spoke tilting her head curiously."Alas, ze kitty has been in a troublesome mood. She rejects ze croissants and ze fruit and...she...she has not smiled ONCE since she arrived.", Adelaide spoke plucking off a leaf and dabbing the tear from her eye. Ein scoffs rolling her eyes.Mandy gasps holding her cheeks in shock, "~Haahhhhhhhh! Oh goodness, this will not do at all!"Ein sighs, "Look there's nothing wrong. I just watching for-GAH!", she elicits feeling something soft and warm press against her back followed by two dainty hands lightly gripping her shoulders. She looks over her shoulder at the Mandy beaming a comforting expression, "W-What the hell are you doing?!""~I just thought a pleasant massaaasage to relax and ease your SEN-ses is what you needed. I was right. Youuuuu are in-CRED-ibly tightly wounnnnd huhuhu.~", Mandy hums mushing her breasts more into her back making Ein tense up."~Ahh! Marvelous idea~!", Adelaide stated before the giant petals close around her body and she recedes into the ground to the men's confusion before giant green roots breaks through a crack in the concrete. A bloom forms on one of the vine before transforming back into the giant yellow and red and Adelaide emerges in front of Ein. She reaches up and begins gingerly caressing the disturbed wind weasel's cheek with a nurturing yet sultry expression. Despite her hands being leafy and vine-like Ein noted they were oddly soft and pleasant like normal skin."~I shall assist you. Ze satisfaction and happiness of every single patron is top priority~", Adelaide spoke before taking an orange square candy from her, "~Alright kitty, try a sample of one as freshly made treats guaranteed put a smile on zat adorable face~""~huhu it's true. I enjoyyyyyyed quite a few this morning. Don't be shy, say 'ahhhh'~", Megan hummed in Ein's ear sending uncomfortable chills down her spine."N-N-No! I already said I'm on a diet! Let me go already and stop rubbing me! What's the matter w-eeek!", Ein protests before letting out a squeak upon feeling Adelaide's large breasts mush against her own."~l' absurdité(nonsense)! You and I are the same size and zere is hardly need to fear. Our confections are 100% organic made no additives to make your body story excess sugars. Huhu and your body already looks healthy sweet kitty~", Adelaide whispered her sweet smelling breath making Ein's cheeks flush."~Indeeeeeed. You have such a beautifully cur-VA-ceous figure and such lean muscles. I'm almost en-VI-ous!~", Megan whispered encouragingly pressing herself more into Ein's back as her waist brushes on her butt and she continues massaging her shoulders, "~Relax, and enjoy the del-LI-cious treat~"The group of four men is soon joined by other male patrons stopping check out the show while Bella, happy at the influx customers, continues selling them fruit and other sweetsEin blushes bright red cringing at the two overly affectionate ladies groping and trying to make her eat candy. She squirms trying to break free but... strangely feels her strength waning from their suffocating kindness. If that even makes sense."Gahh stop it! Stop it! I EEEH...I don't want the-", Ein protests holding her face away from the candy, "I-I'm warning you! I'm with ICEP, I'm law enforce-Hyyah! Don't grab there!"The group of men watching while cheering them on and enjoying the sweet treats."I fuckin' love this place bruh.", nudge the black man to the Caucasian man taking a bite of fruit."I'm coming here everyday I get off man.", the Caucasian man fist bumps him eating some candy as they resume watching the Alraune and Papillon sandwich the thicc weasel lady.On the other side of the lot, the Kimberly the Triclops watches with a malign stare at the group of cheering men. She then sees the lady she spoke to earlier in her...predicament. Cheryl approaches taking her attention from a ready-made firehydrant stack."What going on over there?", Cheryl inquires before noticing Ein, "Is..that ?""I'm afraid...THEY have her now. Don't even try to help your friend. She, like many others, have fallen down the proverbial rabbit hole of endless pleasure with no way to ever escape.", Kimberly cryptically spoke staring with cold dead eyes."Ohhhhkayyy?", Cheryl trails deciding not to inquire further. She then looks over at the various ready-mades, "So did you make all of these yourselves?"Kimberly blinks all three eyes rapidly ensuring she wasn't imagining things before grinning in delight of someone finally showing interest in her work, "Why yes I did actually! I started developing a passion for the art form after my trip to France and viewing some of Duchamp's famous works! The simplistic but thought provoking design and reincorporation of everyday items we callously gloss over excites me! Hahhh my dream is to bring works like his back into limelight! I'm hoping to sell a some to collectors or just anyone with an appreciation for works like these!""Oh, well that's-", Cheryl started before being cut off by Kimberly."Ah, this is one of my favorites! I could tell it's yours too since I caught you ogling it second ago.", She stated excitedly looking over the ready-made stack of fire hydrants, "You see, I made this one as an allegorical representation of how sometimes undervalue the hardships of first response worker's families that blah blah blah blah.Cheryl quietly slinks away as the passionate goes into long speech not even noticing her leaving. She sees Camilla over by the stand where another Triclops was selling assorted painting. She decides to join her."Hmmm interesante ", Camilla murmurs examining the different drawing utensils and color paints and pens. She had never seen such a variety of colors since she usually stuck with a basic grey lead."Do you need any assistance miss?", inquired the young blonde Triclops, "I'm sure I can help if you told me what you had in mind. Are you looking for something to do professional work? Or are you a hobbyist?"Camilla thinks for a moment, "I...tend to draw whenever and whatever catches my interest I suppose.""A hobbyist then! I have just what you need!", The Triclops lady picks up a small black and red carrying case and unfolds it revealing dozens of assortment of brush pens with varying colored and non-colored water-based ink.Camilla's eye twinkle with intrigue, "Tan hermosa(So beautiful), so many colores(colors) and sizes.""I know right? Mine doesn't nearly this many options.", Cheryl chimes as Camilla jerks her head noticing her and immediately frowning. She had hoped she lost the human girl over by the weird junk collection."Oh, are you artist as well miss?", The blonde Triclops inquires."Shoot yeah! In fact, I'm a visual arts graduate. I really enjoy painting abstract and spiritual concept stuff.", Cheryl spoke whimsically as Camilla looks away in disinterest refusing to acknowledge her."That's great! How much do you typically sell for your works?", The blonde Triclops inquired.Cheryl half-smiles shifting her gaze in embarassment, "Well...I don't exactly...or HAVE had anyone interested enough to buy annnd it doesn't help that there's...barely a job market out their for V.A. majors. Plus, there's the old student loans to pay back so gotta put in doubles at work now and again. Hehehehehehehhhh.", Cheryl finishes with fake laughter hiding real pain.Camilla gives a puzzled look. The fuck is a student loans?"Uhh hey I see YOU'RE really into landscape paintings!", Cheryl changes the subject gesturing the various paintings hanging behind the blonde Triclops."Ah yes! I painted them all myself! I really enjoy painting wide open plains and harsh desert regions. It's just something about the vast open regions that convey both spiritual clarity AND unforeseeable challenges that really strikes a chord with me. No what I mean?", Blonde Triclops spoke with a wink."Yeah, I getcha. They sure are beautiful too.", Cheryl turns to Camilla, "What do you think Ms. Camilla?"Camilla looks up at the paintings in thought, "Eh, they are fine."Blonde Triclops gets a pang of annoyance, "O-Oh really? JUST fine? Would you care to elaborate? I welcome constructive criticism."Camilla crosses her arms somehow doubting that statement before starting, "They definitely look pretty enough but I do not FEEL anything when I look at them. I tend to draw from memory...especially ones that have meaning that's why I feel something. These do not feel like your memories but a copy of another's memories.", Camilla explained as Blonde Triclops felt another pang of annoyance but remained professional."Ohhh I see what you mean.", Cheryl says, "I agree, the best pieces are definitely ones inspired by the artist's experiences. Instead of recreating what they've seen in pictures. Oh, t-that isn't to say your paintings are bad in ANY way. I just-""No no! I understand what you mean, perfectly. So, are you guys interested in buying anything or...?""Oh, right! Well, I am running low on water color paints at home. What about you Ms. Camilla? I think you should definitely get the brush pen kit? So many options AND the case matches your eyes.", Cheryl stated as Camilla gives her a strange look unsure whether or not to take offense. She didn't like the idea of doing ANYTHING the human girl said. However, that case DOES look amazing and she could probably do some interesting things with it.I"Jes...I would like the case.", Camilla spoke forming an orange magic seal in her palm before what looked like a blue debit card with ICEP symbol and her student picture on it, "Umm...I will be paying with this?"Cheryl looks on with twinkling fan girl eyes as the Blonde Triclops graciously accepts the card. Camilla herself didn't quite understand how Señor managed to stuff money into a tiny piece of plastic like that."Ahh, an ICEP student benefits card. So nice of you to give your homestay some spending money.", Blonde Triclops spoke to Cheryl before swipping the card.Camilla recoils in disgust before turning to the Triclops, "T-This human is NOT mi caretaker!""Hehe, yeah we're just friends is all.", Cheryl giggles sheepishly to which Camilla whips around"No the hell we are not!", Camilla refuted pointing a finger threateningly at her before the Triclops jumps in."Ok! You're all set! Here you go, miss!", Blonde Triclops stated with a smile handing her back her card.Camilla snatches it away letting it recede back into the magic seal before grabbing her new case of art supplies and quickly walking away. Cheryl gives a quizzical look before turning to quickly pay for her stuff."Ok, that's it for me. Thank you. Hey, wait for me Ms. Camilla!", Cheryl stated going off in Camilla's direction.Blonde Triclops watches them leave with a smile before it quickly fades. She then utters in a low, agitated tone, "Bitches."Camilla walk quickly trying to get away from that scene becoming more annoyed seeing the human girl tailing behind her like a lost puppy. Why was she so persistent to be around her?! Why doesn't She just leave her alone? She's had to put up with her presence all day but now the human has overstayed her welcome. She clenches her fist. Perhaps a good bashing will help get the message through her thick skull."Hi there!", called a voice snapping Camilla violent thoughts. She turns and sees yet another Triclops woman, this one a brunette, carrying what appeared to be giant sketchpads. Camilla looks around finally noticing the collection of pencil sketch drawings of humans, plants, animal, even liminals on display. Blank canvas rolls, panels, strecher bars and panels and boxes of charcoal paper and printmaking papers covered the place. She noticed the drawing all had bizarrely exaggerated proportions and distorted features giving an uncanny and almost disturbing appearance."Welcome, my name's Zoey and I'm the owner of this little section. I couldn't help noticing you carrying a supply case from my co-workers stand. You've got really good taste. I use the same set for my work here.", the brunette Triclops woman complimented."Ehh...gracias?", Camilla spoke taking in the strangeness of each drawing, "What...IS your work exactly? Why are these drawings so...like dis?""You've never seen caricature art before Ms. Camilla?", Cheryl inquired instantly reminding Camilla, to her chagrin, that she still existed, "It's a very expressive art form that allows the artists to fully present everything that makes a person or object unique. It's usually played for satire and ridiculing the subject but it makes you really appreciate those differences by just...PUTTING it all out there hahaha!"Camilla gives her a blank look to which Cheryl notices and ceases laughing clearing her throat awkwardly. Suddenly, Zoey speaks up."That's right! Boy I CANNOT tell you how long it's been since I've had customers like you...or customers period. Hahahahahaha!", Zoey chuckles her eye twitching.Camilla and Chery recoil slightly noticing a few caricature drawings of the Papiliion( Valerie) with a giant wide forehead, big buck teeth, balloon boobs, and making a 'sucky-sucky' gesture holding a pickle. Pettiness at it's finest."So how about letting me draw you guys? Only twenty bucks per drawing AND I'll even let you borrow some prooooops.", the Zoey offered showing a box with several novelty hats, you giant sandwiches and hotdogs, and a cheeseburger backpack."I have no interest in being drawn as one of your cartoon characters.", Camilla says with unamused slightly intimidating glare before raising up her case, "I would like to try these out on your paper.""O-Oh, certainly I have a few open stands I use for teaching people my craft. Feel free to use one.", Zoey pointed ahead to the five vacant eisel stands and seats. Camilla nods leaving the two behind. Cheryl watches her leaving and thinking to herself."What about you miss?", Zoey offers Cheryl taking out some pens."Thanks, but I'll pass. I'm just gonna go look around a bit.", Cheryl says before leaving Zoey alone.Zoey nods before noticing a three other customers viewing her pictures, "Ah! Hello there welcome! Would you like me to draw your pictures.", she spoke cheerfully while discreetly stabbing the eyes out of the Valerie caricature.Camilla sets up and takes a seat in front of the large blank paper. Adjacent from her, two human women notice her and cautiously step further away before whispering to each other. She ignores them and unfastens the case deciding on which to start with before selecting the red stencil. She closes her eyes to concentrate."Ok! You guys ready to begin?", Zoey energetically spoke plopping down in front if the canvas pens ready."U-um...yeah but c-can we move...somewhere else. Somewhere more private?", the Caucasian lady in the yellow sundress says in a deep Georgia accent repeatedly looking to Camilla suspiciously. Camilla glances at her in annoyance before returning to her work."Uh yeah. Maybe closer to where we came in?", the other light tan woman said in a similar accent watching Camilla carefully."I'm sorry but this is the only area with enough space.", Zoey answered curiously, "Is there a particular reason?""Yes, I just don't feel safe with...that around.", Yellow sundress lady stated looking to Camilla who continued to ignore her, "There's no telling what it's plotting over there."Zoey is taken aback but remains professional, "Miss, I can assure you aren't in any danger. I just spoke with her moments ago and she seems like an OK person. And frankly, those kinds of remarks aren't warranted""Oh don't gimme that! I have no problem with you people it's some I just watch out for. My cousin down here nearly got killed by some fire-eyed devil dogs they sure didn't seem like OK people. Now, the ones like y'all at least look enough like us.", She spoke then looking at Camilla with disgust, "But things like that there, shouldn't even be let in this country. Everything started going to hell since these demons and...witches and all that mess started pourin' in!"Camilla clenches her pen her hand trembling with anger as she tried her best to ignore the human and focus on her drawing."Ma'am listen it's just-", Zoey tries to interject."They don't even produce anything useful like some of the other species. Her kind are wicked and hurt people for fun and have sex with just anybody. Just ANYBODY even if they're married.", the other woman sneers looking Camilla up and down, "Just seduce and corrupt young men folk turning them into heathens just like them!", The woman watches Camilla's reaction and sees the She-devil becoming visibly agitated."So you gonna make it leave or not?!", stated the yellow sundress lady as Camilla shot a sideways glare."B-But she done anything wrong.", Zoey uttered nervously.Yellow sundress lady leans in intimidatingly, "Now you listen here, if you don't get her to leave I'm fixin' on callin' ICEP and get them to do it. Good luck selling your stuff after that.", Zoey goes silent as the lady lean back and mutters under her breath going in her purse, "Need to send her ass back to hell where she belongs."That was the last straw for Camilla as she creates two small black magic seal above the two women, without them noticing, about to strike them both down. When suddenly..."Heyyy! Sorry for making you wait!", came Cheryl catching everyone's attention as she maneuvers past them grabbing a stool and sitting right in front Camilla. The demoness gives a confused look, "Ok, I am ready when you are."Camilla gives a profoundly puzzled look as does Zoey and the two women."Uhh...darlin' what are you doin'?", Yellow sundress lady inquires"Getting a face sketch.", Cheryl answered before winking to Camilla, "This woman right here, one of THE best sketch artists around!", she says proudly gesturing to Camilla.Yellow sundress lady and her friend exchange looks."Hun, I don't think you understand what that thing is. I think you should come over here we just talking to triple eyes over here to get it to leave.", Yellow sundress lady suggested."Oh I what SHE is, she's an artist and a cool lady.", Cheryl chided with a smirk, "and no thanks, I think YOU should leave that dress is so bright if anyone draws you it'd be a blank canvas."Yellow sundress lady jaw drops processing what she said."Ok, Ms. Camilla, are you ready?", Cheryl flashes a supportive at Camilla before posing with a toothy grin.The demoness' eyes widen as she processed the situation. She glances at the two ladies and Zoey then back to Cheryl who nods encouragingly at her. She closes her eyes inhaling as the black magic seals disappeared."Jes, let us begin.", Camilla spoke before tearing off a page tossing it aside. She focuses on Cheryl taking in every minor detail. She selects five pens, closes her eyes to focus. Her eyes shoot open with sharp intent as her hand whips and darts around the paper at blinding speed. Zoey, the two other ladies, even Cheryl stare flabbergasted at the spectacle. Barely a minute later, Camilla was finished placing the pens away then taking the canvas off the eisel, "How is this?"Cheryl, Zoey, and the two ladies jaws drop in amazement upon seeing the sketch. Not only did she capture every single detail if Cheryl's head from skin tone to the small mole above her eyebrow but she also sketched the entire background as well; including the three other blank canvases behind her."T-That is incredible Ms. Camilla. It's like I'm looking in a mirror! Ah hell even my reflection wouldn't look this good! Where'd you learn to draw like this?!", Cheryl stated emphatically as Camilla is taken aback by her genuine praise."I...it is just a hobby I got better at over the years. It also helps that mi photographic is suppurb.", Camilla replies shooting a look at the two ladies."That's so cool, I'm so lucky to know someone as talented as you.", Cheryl stated making sure the two women were watching before taking out a twenty from her wallet, "Here, you've earned it."Camilla gives a surprised look, "I-I cannot accept-""No no no!", Cheryl stops placing it in her hand, "You more than deserve it. In fact, I think I'll do another sketch. You up for it?", Cheryl furrows her eyebrow darting. Camilla notices the two women staring dumbfounded and speechless and decides to play along with Cheryl in screwing with them."Why of course miss.", Camilla stated with a wide grin showing her sharp teeth disturbing the two ladies.Cheryl strike a pose with her fist to the sky as Camilla selects her pens, "Can you draw me with like long magic staff shooting lightning?"Camilla shakes her head, "I'll see what I can do."With that, Camilla darts and dashes at the same insane speed as before. Zoey and the women stare speechless.The yellow sundress lady gives a frustrated look, "Well are you gonna draw me or not?!", she yells Zoey who snaps out of her trance."Oh, y-y-yes ma'am!", Zoey proceeds to draw the woman with barely half the speed as Camilla while the sundress lady scoffs at the demoness.Back over at the Papillon's area, Mirabelle stood by the fold-up tables with all the multicolored oily substances, ribbons, hats, and other accessories as Bae-Bae tantalizingly dangles a vial of bubblegum colored liquid in front of the blushing Centaur." S-So how does it work?", Mirabelle inquires sheepishly."~Ohhh it's quite simple.~", Bae-Bae emphasizes in a sultry tone before opening to vial, "~Herrrrre rub a bit on your fingers~"Mirabelle reluctantly sticks out her hand as she allows a drop of semi-viscous, sweet-smelling liquid on her finger. As she massages it on her other digits, her eyes widen upon feeling her nerve ending's sensitivity skyrocket. Feeling each with her thumb sent tiny sparks of pleasure through her arm. She looks up in astonishment to Bae-Bae grinning favorably."~huhuhu see what I meeean? This little treat is fabricated from concentrate Alraune pollen and marigold extract. The result is a lu-BRI-cating gel that greatly en-HAN-ces the touch receptors you see. Especially, ones associated with pleasure *wink*. Just massage a gen-ER-ous amount anywhere on your skin. Aaaannyywhere.~"Mirabelle gulps blushing while hugging her chest, "A-Anywhere?""~That's right my dear. It's twennnty times more effective than the KY jelly stuff humans use AND it is quite del-LI-cous. Have a taste.~", Bae-Bae informs before Mirabelle does as instructed putting in her mouth and relishing in sweet flavor couple with the pleasurable sensation of her tongue against her finger. Bae-Bae leans in, "~Seeeee? Pleasurable in two ways for you annnd your lover~."Mirabelle's mind begins wandering to naughty scenarios with her and Caleb almost making her drool before straightening up quickly taking out her little Sailor Moon wallet, "How much?!""~Fifteeeeeen dollar per vial. However, because you're so a-DOR-able I'll give a second vial free of charrrrge.~", Bae-Bae replies before Mirabelle takes out a twenty handing it to her then taking the two vials."Ms. Marequine!", called the voice of Ein. Mirabelle quickly hides the vials in her bag."Ah M-Ms. Ein, there you-", Mirabelle stops upon seeing Ein's...questionable state. Her clothes were wrinkled and strung haphazardly, her hair was a mess, her entire body radiated a strong sweet odor, and she had what appeared to be lipsticks stains on her cheeks, "Goodness, w-what happened to you?!""I DON'T want to talk about it let's just get Ms. Camilla and Banks and leave.", Ein half-demanded before noticing Adelaide and Mandy waving sweetly at her. A chill going down her spine."Umm, what is those peculiar things sticking out of your pockets?", Mirabelle inquires pointing to the three colored pouches protruding from Ein dress.Ein tucks them away in embarassment, "N-Nothing important! Let's just finds those two already!""~oooh, I could be of some assistance~", Bae-Bae chimes with a wink."YOU stay the hell away from-", Ein catches herself, "I mean...thank you but we find them on our own.", she spoke before hurrying Mirabelle away from Papillon."~Ok then! Good luck!", Bae-Bae stated before flash a 'you got this' gesture at Mirabelle. The Centaur nods at her."Hmmm, where did they go off to last time I saw them they were over by the statues", Ein affirms gesturing to the ready-mades where Kimberly was still passionately carrying on her speech; even drawing a small crowd to the spectacle. She and Mirabelle look around some more hoping to spot them hoping Camilla didn't do anything...drastic."I should've got my money back from that triple eyed freak.", came a lady in yellow sundress and her friend passing Ein and Mirabelle, "I mean, this looks NOTHIN' like me!", she state to her friend showing a caricature drawing of herself with large puffy lip, beadie little eyes, and yellow dress."And who does that FOUR-eyed skank think she is. Her and her Devils friend. Let's go they ain't even worth it.", her friend chided as yellow sundress agreed. Ein and Mirabelle give each other curious and slightly worried looks before going in the direction the women came from."*gasp* Ms. Ein...look...", Mirabelle says as Ein follows her gaze. Her eyes widen in surprise seeing Camilla sitting at a stool, legs crossed and wings slightly extended posing while Cheryl tried to sketch. They notice Cheryl chuckling heartily about something while, to amazement, Camilla seemed amused even giggling along with her.Mirabelle and Ein nod to each other understandingly and decided to stay for a little while longer. Ein decided, of course, to survey they from way atop the building the rest of the time....While all that was happening, Caleb's and Mahkah's group were doing some bonding of their own.Zoom"Hahahahaha seriously that's freakin' awesome!", Min Jun exclaims as Caleb teleported with him 20 feet down the trail while Zwei, Lyca, Hollo and Rebecca chortled excitedly in amazement as Caleb whoops in excitement."Ooh ooh me next! Me next!", Lyca stated bouncing around.After Caleb's...questionable victory, Hollo became quite upset accusing Caleb's team of cheating, an act, among werewolves, considered shameful and worthy of severe punishment. Things broke out in a short argument before Caleb admitted that he had no knowledge he was capable of that until today. Hollo was reluctant at first, but thanks to Lyca, and seeing the honesty in his eyes, he was telling the truth. She relents citing the purpose of competitions like these were to bring out the best in a pack and it's not uncommon to discover new skills as a result. Essentially, Caleb lived up to that standard and Hollo and Lyca declared their pack alliance a success!Afterwards, they decided to really look more into Caleb apparent TELEPORTING ability. Caleb himself especially. Shockingly though, it did not take very long for him to start getting the hang of how it works. Annnd abuse the hell out of it.Zoom, Caleb teleported back to the group with Min Jun hooting excitedly as Lyca and the rest erupted in excitement as well."AHAHAA! This is so fucking cool! It's not even that hard to control! I just look and concentrate where I want to go *zoom*... and I'm there! ", Caleb chortled with an excited grin teleporting behind Lyca making her whip around in excitement, "I'm fuckin' black Nightcrawler!""Orrr JUST Nightcrawler since he's already...yeah", Drei comments making a circular motion a Caleb's face."Yeah I...guess ya got me the-ow.", Caleb winces getting a sudden sharp headache the rubbing his temple. Zwei, Drei and Lyca give him concerned looks."You ok man?", Mahkah inquires."Y-Yeah I'm good!", Caleb answers assuringly before the best idea pops into his head, "Oh, Mahkah, I wanna do somethin'. This gone hilarious."Caleb goes over and whispers into Mahkah's ear to Lyca and the rest's curiosity."Pfft really?", Mahkah muffled a chuckle to which Caleb smiles widely, "Alright."Caleb walks away getting a good several feet away from the group as they watched wondering what they were up to. He clears his throat preparing his act."Despite their issues, every Pokemon game has something special to offer.", Caleb spoke as if addressing a large crowd, "And Sword and Shield are no different!""Pokemon Let's Go is superior!", Mahkah stated.*zoom* "NOT SCIENTIFICALLY POSSIBLE!", Caleb shouted teleporting in front of him. Zwei and Min Jun smiled widely before bursting in hysterical laughter. They're then joined by Hollo and Lyca who didn't quite get why it was funny but laugh anyway."AHHH HE DID THE FLORPUS THING!", Zwei snorted laughing nearly falling out of her seat. Drei watches Caleb suspiciously something in her gut warning her."HAHAAAA oh man. I have LIVED!", Min Jun stated jubilantly.Mahkah and Caleb share a chuckles as well. Suddenly, a sharp headache attacks rips through Caleb's head making him bunch slightly holding his head with one hand. Mahkah and Drei immediately get to their feet as the rest cease laughing and switch to concern."Whoa, hey man, are you alright? Here sit down.", Mahkah stated as Caleb follows and sits, "How do you feel?""Ughh j-just got headache. Doesn't seem to bad tho-", Caleb pauses feeling something wet on his upper. He touches the top to find his fingers stained red with blood from his nose. Lyca and the others see it and shift into panic, "Ok, that can't be good."Drei approaches him before getting in his lap, "Hold still.", she requests before cupping her cheeks examining his eyes and face. Lyca and the rest surround them waiting with baited breath. Drei opens her eyes."Doesn't look to be anything major. My guess is you likely overexerted yourself. Your body and mind aren't used to the strain of being 'Black Nightcrawler' yet. I suggest stop teleporting for awhile. Drei's orders.", Drei stated giving Caleb some tissue to dry his nose then pulls out a small vial with little green candy-like balls in before popping out two of them, "Eat this, they're chewable. It'll nullify the pain and help recovery some stamina.""Thank you.", Caleb says before doing as instructed and notes the quite bittersweet taste but deals qwith it. Seconds later, he feels his headache receding much to his and the rests relief. Mahkah presents Caleb a D.D. Pepper to help was it down which he gratefully accepts."Heyyy, they kinda look like senzu b-YOWP!", Min Jun started before Drei flings a blue pellet that explodes covering his entire mouth like was of bubblegum.The group spent the rest of their time together exchanging stories. Lyca and Hollo shared a few light-hearted shenanigans from when they were pups. Eventually, it was time for Caleb and his group to call it a day. Mahkah and his wards unanimously decided they've done enough research in the area and decided to pack up the campsite; with assistance from Caleb's group. Both groups continued along to the very end of the trail where they caught a ride with two of the park rangers back to the entrance of the trail.As the groups enters the parking lot, Min Jun and Rebecca walk ahead to Mahkah's car( a grey-ish blue Subaru forester) carrying their stuff with Lyca and Hollo coming up behind with their hands full. Mahkah unlocks the trunk and doors for them with the keys.Zwei watches them load the vehicle as Lyca, Hollo, and Rebecca talking among each. Min Jun could be seen presenting a folded paper to Drei, which she reluctantly accepts prompting a few grateful bows from the fox boy. She then sees Caleb and Mahkah doing something on their phones."Alright you got my phone number and my Zoom info?", Caleb inquires."Yep, just got it. I'll be sure call when we get into Birmingham.", Mahkah says putting his phone away."Yeah, be careful down there it gets pretty crazy, especially at night.", Caleb advised."Thanks for the heads up.", Mahkah replies before hearing a loud crash by Hollo apologizing and looks to see his collection of marbles from every state rolling all over the parking lot, "Ah hell, not again! Hang on a minute.""Need some help?""No no, I got it!", Mahkah stated quickly heading over to salvage the mess.Caleb looks on as Lyca and Hollo try catching the tiny ball while giggling trying not to fall on each other. He then notices Zwei approach to his side without looking at him. A thoughtful expression on her face as she watched the two she-wolves."Those two are somethin' ain't they?", Caleb say with a small grin."I guess so.", Zwei answers plainly."It makes sense though. I hear sisters have a special kind of bond much different than with men. I bet it's like that with you and your sisters.", Caleb says"Yeah, definitely, but...you know...sometimes...it's good to want something different.", Zwei uttered averting her gaze, "Well, 'different' but also...famiiar."Caleb raises an eyebrow, "Does this have anything to do with the outburst you had a while ago?"Zwei crosses her arms, "You sound like Ein.", spoke bitterly."I just wanna know what this was about, is all? Why were you telling Lyca to do all that...unnecessary stuff on our date? And why do you have such a beef with Hollo?", Caleb inquired as patiently as he could muster, "Listen, you're my bodyguard but that doesn't mean you can't come to me about something bothering you. You know?"Zwei goes silent, "I...I just wanted to help her because...she's just like me."Caleb looks at her curiously , "Go on.""I don't know how to describe it, when I first met her we just...clicked. Like, we're each others spirit animal, if that makes sense. We talked alot and I realized both of us grew up pretty much in the shadow of our siblings, always getting left behind, and nobody really understanding us. Back home, Ein was always the responsible leader that EVERYONE depended on even among other Kamaitachi families. Drei? She's basically a medicinal genius surpassing even the elder healers in the families.", she spoke looking away."What about you?", Caleb inquires."I'm just...a clown.", Zwei spoke coldly, "We Kamataichi are alway born in a trio and each have a role to play in the trinity that we're trained to fulfill but...I wanted to be more than just my role like my sisters were. Unfortunately, I sucked at everything else from big solo missions to cooking, but pulling pranks or making others laugh makes me happy. It helped me stand out of my family's shadows. I Heck, it's how I developed some of my own techniques! Even everyone, even my mothers, didn't approve and just told me to 'Stop acting like a child'. Or, 'Be the warrior I'm supposed to be'. Or, 'Don't squander your abilities so frivolously'. Haahhhh...the only one who encouraged me and really understood me was Bàba(Papa). We always had fun together", Zwei smiles for a moment remembering her dad laughing with her, "After he died, I felt so...alone. My sisters and our moms...I know they love me but...you know..."Caleb's eyes widen as his thoughts turning to memories of his own parents before she continues."Lyca...the way she talks, how we get along, it reminds me so much of Bàba.", Zwei spoke looking at Lyca scrambling about with Hollo trying to help a desperate Mahkah catch all the marbles, "She cares about you a whole lot but she not good at expressing how she felt in words. I just wanted to help her show you everything I KNOW she has to offer AND do it on my own without help from anyone!", Zwei trails off looking pensively at Lyca, " You know, I noticed she doesn't like talking about her old life. ...I guess hearing what Lyca went through and finding her sister did almost NOTHING to stop it...I just...""I understand. You were following your heart no matter how rough the path it took you. I won't say I APPROVE but I understand.", Caleb replied.Zwei sighs, "I bet you're tell Ein or Sterling what I did right? Tch, whatever, I was bound to get yelled at over somethin' soon anyw-", Zwei is cut off upon feeling Caleb petting the top of her head. She look up at him in surprise, "W-What are you-?!"Listen!", Caleb cuts her off in a firm tone, "I'm not telling either of them about this. While...a bit abrasive what you did...it kinda worked. I feel a bit closer to Lyca and...i'll admit some of that advice you gave...was practical. Never thought her hips could sway like that hehe. Basically, you did good today. Thank you.", he praised while gingerly petting her soft ears, "And for the record, it takes a true badass to be a clown in world full of mimes."Zwei eyes widen at his words reminding her something her Baba would say to cheer her up. She grins enjoying this familiar sensation, "~Haahhh, you mean it Boss?~ That makes me so happy. Hehe I thought you'd be mad for sure.""Haha who said I wasn't mad?", Caleb spoke in a malicious tone before twisting the weasel's ear a bit making her tense at the pain."Owowowowow ouch!", Zwei elicits before he releases her ear."Never. Do this. Again. Lyca is a big girl let her love me HER way.", Caleb spoke firmly."OK OK geez! Really lured me in with that one huh? I'M supposed to be the sneaky one.", Zwei says rubbing her ear."Ha! Not that sneaky. Tell me, you enjoy the show Lyca and I put on back on the trail?", Caleb spoke with a knowing smirk to which Zwei tenses up and blushes beet red."Wha-h-h-h-how did you know I was watching the whole time?!""I wasn't sure but you just confirmed it. Frankly, it's kinda creepy...yet I'm weirdly not mad at all and that worries me a little. If I'm being 100% honest...I might have been...turned on more KNOWING someone's watching. So maybe I'M the real creep", Caleb shamefully admits as Zwei blushes."Hmmm, yeah, but you're pretty cool creep.", Zwei smirks playfully bumping her hip to his as he gives he a look.Suddenly, Lyca and Hollo come bounding over."Hi Chief! What are you and Zwei talking about?", Lyca beams sweetly."Oh! Nothin' much, just...talking about how much fun we had here.", Caleb smiles petting Zwei's head again making her flinch before feeling the gentle caress of his fingers. She sighs in relief."Yeah, today was soooo much fun.", Hollo stated before focusing on Zwei, "I really enjoyed racing with you Zwei. I'm glad to have you as a pack mate.", She says before wrapping Zwei in a big hug nuzzling her cheek lovingly."Thanks for being my sister's friend.", she whispers into her ear surprising the wind weasel. She releases her as a small grin spreads across Zwei's face. Hollo turns and hugs Caleb."Hollo! It's time to go sweety!", Mahkah calls out from the SUV."Okay!", She shouts back before turning Caleb, "You all take care now! We'll be back again soon! Can't wait to meet the rest of your pack!", she says sprinting off join Mahkah and the rest. She leaps right through one of the wide open windows as Min Jun ducks for his life. She begins waving out the window saying her goodbyes before Mahkah and the rest join in. Caleb and his group wave goodbye as their new friends pull out and leave the parking lot.Drei then approaches the group holding a folded up paper, "Well my soul now belongs to The Aether. Can we leave now?"Yeah, just gotta sign us out at the ranger office.", Caleb says turning before being stopped by Zwei."Don't sweat it Boss, I got it.", Zwei assured before dashing off as a sharp gust of wind blew past them."Alllllright then, let's get the engine started.""Hey Chief, what are those on your shirt?", Lyca spoke pointing at his chest."My shirt? Whatcha me-", Caleb looks down shocked to see the his entire shirt and part of his cargo pants littered front to back with small holes, "Wh-What the...batshit hell?!""Heyyy! There's some on mine too!", Lyca stated gesturing to her crop top and jean shorts littered in holes even exposing her perky nips to which Caleb advised for her to cover."Did she...why would she...?!", Caleb uttered looking in Zwei's direction. He then feels a tug on his pants and sees Drei with her outfit covered in tiny holes."I am so sorry...but it appears Zwei... really likes you.", Drei spoke cryptically, "and the more she likes you the more holes you get.", She said raising her arms showing she had even more holes on the inside of her dress, " It's a habit of hers. Ein and I need to check our clothes almost every morning. Every morning for friendship holes.""Well ain't we sweet? Give her compliment she turns ya into a Swiss cheese hobo.", Caleb replies."Don't be ridiculous. We're more like sponges." , She then takes out a small sewing kit selecting a needle and thread, "Now hold still. Unless becoming living pin cushions is your kink. I don't judge. "After Drei fixed their clothes, they group headed back home. Lyca rode shotgun and Drei took the backseat while Zwei, conveniently, decided to take tail them from above. The evening sunset illuminated their way as they bid temporary farewell to the nature trail. Lyca leans her elbow out the open window enjoying the feel of the wind against her ears. Her thoughts drift to the conversation with her sister....flashback...Lyca and Hollo sat together on a large boulder by the flowing stream."It's so hard to believe.", Hollo spoke thoughtfully.Lyca gives her a puzzled look, "Hmm, what is?""It's hard to believe how much you've changed Lyca. You were always so...frail. So afraid to speak to others in our pack. Now, your fighting enemies twice your size, you're all muscly, and you're an Alpha of your own pack!", Hollo stated in amazement."Actually, Mira is the Alpha of our pack but Chief loves us all equally.", Lyca corrected.Hollo eyes widen, "Wait, you're...not the Alpha?""Well...Chief doesn't really believe in pack ranking he just sees us ALL as his family.", Lyca replies.Hollo pauses, "Wow...that sounds just like Mahkah and me.", she spoke sweetly before a frown crosses her face, "Lyca, I'm...I'm so sorry. Our siblings and pack mates were always so cruel to you and...and If only I did more to help you. Maybe if they saw you getting a little stronger maybe you wouldn't have had to leave and-", Hollo is silenced by Lyca hugging her."It's ok sis, I don't blame you one bit. I don't even blame them. Besides, it's a good thing I left. I got to meet new people, see new things, learn about video games and movies, and...I met Chief, and Mira, Cami, Chief's uncle, and Zwei and HER sisters. The reason I'm stronger now...is because, since that night with the big fiery wolf, I wanted to become stronger to protect him AND my family. I love him, I love all of them, and I love you too sis.", Lyca spoke beaming the sweetest smile.Hollo chocked back her tears before wiping them away smiling back at her, "I waited so long to see you again."The two embrace lovingly their tails wagging happily in unison. Hollo pulls away and immediately gets an idea."Lyca! Let's merge our packs! Let's have a race together and really test our skills!", Hollo stated."Y-Yeah! That sounds like a great idea!", Lyca stated pumping her fists, "It'd be great having you as a pack mate again!""Yeah and the best part we'll have puppies from our Alphas in the SAME pack!", Hollo exclaimed blushing slightly as Lyca blushes as well grinning and tails excitedly at the thought of having puppies with Chief....end of flashback...As Caleb drives down the road, he notices Lyca grinning eyes closed with a longing expression tail beating beating against the seat. He raises and eyebrow questioning but decided to ignore it and just kept driving....At the same time, Mirabelle's group were preparing to head home as well. They waited on the corner waiting for their trolley with Cheryl."Annnd, ok I have you saved into my phone.", Ein stated putting her phone away, "Again, Ms. Banks, it's been a pleasure having you as part of our group.""Thank YOUUU guys. You guys made my weekend ALOT more exciting. We should definitely do this again some time.", Cheryl stated while hold a stack of rolled up sketches Camilla drew."Indeed, that sounds brilliant.", Mirabelle agreed before looking to Camilla who wore a thought expression clenching her new artist case with three rolled up sketches papers sticking off, "What about you Camilla? Did you have fun?"Camilla snaps from her thoughts looking to Mirabelle, "Jes...it was...fun."Cheryl smiles at her to which Camilla quickly averts her attention away. Suddenly the Liminal trolley could be heard approaching."Ah, looks like the trolley's here. I hope everyone has everything and didn't leave anything behind.", Ein spoke before everyone checks their clothes finding they had all their stuff. The trolley pulls in front of the group and the doors open. They step back allowing riders to get off first. As they wait to board, Cheryl walks up to Camilla."Hey, Ms. Camilla?", Cheryl inquires as Camilla turns her head looking from the corner of her eye, "Ignore those women from earlier, they're just bitter at the fact they don't have a fraction of the artistic talent you have. Hell, I'M a bit jelly. But thank you again for letting me keep these.", she stated gesturing to the three rolled sketch papers, "I'm surprised you even wanted to keep mine when they're so...""Stop your babbling girl.", Camilla spoke surprising Cheryl and the others, "We both drew as we saw each other. If I didn't want them WHY would I keep them? Do not sell your talents short either girl."Cheryl eyes twinkle before smiling at her, "Y-Yeah, you're right. Thank you.""Hmm", Camilla hums to herself before boarding the trolley. Mirabelle and Ein follow behind her and take their seats closest to the window. They wave to Cheryl, who does the same, as the trolley pulls off driving down the street.Camilla places her bags beside her relaxing her back against the seat. She then unfolds one of the sketches Cheryl did of her. Though a bit crude, she managed to details of her body well. A small grin crosses her lips."Oh wow, that's a wonderful portrait Cheryl made of you Camilla.", Mirabelle compliments leaning from the side."Hehe looks like you made a friend today Ms. Sartana.", Ein stated furrowing her eyebrows."Pffft, I would HARDLY go that far.", Camilla replied rolling up the sketch, "She is...alright. Certainly more tolerable than other humans I've seen today."Mirabelle grins happily at her statement."Besides, I would say JU were muy popular with the butterfly and Alraune today. Made a little horny boy fan club.", Camilla smirked devilishly as Ein tenses up in shock, "Oh jes, I could hear eeeeevrything Señora kitty hehehe."Mirabelle gives a questioning look as Ein blushes beet red in embarassment and frustration. She proceeds to berate Camilla making angry weasel sounds with some of the passengers give them weird looks as Mirabelle tries in vain to calm Ein. Camilla crosses her legs leaning back with a smirk of not giving a shit....Later...Everyone arrived home safe and relatively sound with Mirabelle's group arriving just after Caleb's got settled in. They spent a couple hours talking about how their days went. They talked everything from Lyca's sister to Mahkah's group to their meeting with Cheryl and the overly affectionate Papillon. Caleb even showed off his new teleporting ability much to Mirabelle's group shock and amazement. Feeling exhausted, Caleb decided to take a shower and turn in early while he let the girls help themselves to his entertainment center and whatever he had in his kitchen. Luckily, Ein and Mirabelle made sure Zwei and Lyca didn't get too chaotic as they settled on playing some Blazblue: Crosstag and watching a few comedy shows on Caleb's tv. Camilla eventually turned in for the evening as well along with the Zyklons doing the same after helping Mirabelle tidy up. Mirabelle says goodnight to Zyklons before Lyca and Mirabelle go off to their rooms.Inside Caleb's room, the young man lay asleep in bed. He was softly snoring, his chest heaving up and down. Suddenly, unbeknownst to him, a figure appears, it's body obscured in the darkness, as it crept up to his bed not making a sound. They knelt down to the side of his bed and proceeded to unbutton his blue checker-pattern pajama bottoms. He decided to go topless tonight leaving chest and abs already bare. The figure smirks in satisfaction gently pulling out his limp member proceeding to stroke it with her tender fingers until it was fully erect as Caleb stirred a bit in his sleep. The figure stops and then proceeds to take off their purple t-shirt allowing their large braless D-cups to bounce freely. They take out two small vials of pink liquid and proceeded to pour a generous amount on their breasts. Instantly, their soft flesh reach unfathomable levels of sensitivity causing them to bite their bottom lip stifling their whimper before positioning themselves over Caleb's towering member. The second they wrap their flesh around his member, Caleb's eyes shot open."Waahaaaa! Wh-Moon Piyaahhhaaa?", Caleb elicits a sharp moan as he waves of pure ecstasy bombard his lower region. He quickly raises himself up getting a good look at her thanks to the faint light from the window."~Huhuhuhu sorry for waking you Dear. I ahhhh just couldn't wait any laaaahh-nger to give you your present.", Mirabelle moaned sultrily servicing him with a wet boob job. She sighs in bliss as his meat stick churning her extremely sensitive flesh lubricated by the sweet smelling pink liquid, "Plus, I wahhhhnted to pick up where haaahh we left of this morning.""Well haaa y-you decided not *pant* to waste time huhhhhh?", Caleb moaned looking down at his girlfriend devotedly undulating her pink oil covered flesh against his manhood, "Holy shit this feels good. Haahh what kinda oil is that?! Smells like bubblegum.""I ahhhh purchased it today. It's supp-ahhhh-osed to make the skin quite *pant* sensitive and heighten pleasure sensors. It's really effective.", Mirabelle hums quickly dangling one of the vials then placing it away. Her eyes glazed with lust as her boob flesh feels like it's melting like butter onto her lover's cock as her harden nipples sending surges of electricity through her body."Yeahhh no crap. This is wayyy better than usual. H-Here let me help you out.", Caleb utters shifting his legs over the side of bed allowing better access between his legs."Happy you like love haahhh...y-you're going enjoy this even more.", she in a sultry before licking the very tip of his member tasty his precum as Caleb throws his head back in delight. She giggles teasing him a little more with her tongue before taking in as much of him as she could. Her head excitedly bobs up and down as she swirls her tongue lenjoying the unique taste of the bubblegum oil and precum. The mixture sent waves of ecstasy through her mouth."Haaa...Haa...moon pie", Caleb utters stroking her head lustfully seeking more pleasure which she happily obliged.Suddenly, the door cracks open."Psst, Chief are you asleep?", came the voice of Lyca. Mirabelle ceases her motions as she and Caleb become annoyed at having their buzz killed. Lyca peaks in her eyes aglow from her night vision and immediately notices the pair, "Oh! Mira's here too, that's perfect."Mirabelle and Caleb give each other puzzled looks."W-Why is that perfect?", Caleb inquires."It means we can have a communal mating session. It's customary in pack afterall for Alpha pairs to mate with secondary ranks. And Chief already made it ok by doing that stuff with me earlier.", Lyca explained."W-Wait, you did what?!", Mirabelle stated in surprise.Caleb pauses collecting him then exhaling, "Allow me to explain."He then spends a couple minutes explaining what he did with Lyca."Oh my...I...that is...something...", Mirabelle uttered taking all the information in."Are you mad? I know I...should have told you earlier.", Caleb apologizes as Lyca sits on the floor like a scolded child."Indeed, you should have.", Mirabelle says, "However, I'm not mad in the slightest. In fact, I'm glad you've deepened your relationship even more. It... still feels a bit strange but...as long you're still in love with Dear I'm fine with whatever you do."Caleb and Lyca sigh in relief."In fact, I AM quite curious of this 'communal mating' so let's try it", Mirabelle stated before Lyca hops up excitedly."This is so exciting.", Lyca giggles bouncing giddily."What do we do first Lyca?", Mirabelle inquires with grin."Hmmm, not sure, why don't we let Chief start. He seems to be a natural at this stuff.", Lyca narrows a lustful gaze at Caleb."Agreed, THAT he is.", Mirabelle concurs turning the same gaze at Caleb."Don't I get a say in this...and I'm not getting to sleep soon am I?", Caleb sighed as both girls slowly and sadistically shake their heads no."Don't be a prude Dear, just think of it as a...'bonding experience.', Mirabelle quips in a snarky tone furrowing her eyebrows. Caleb gives her a dry look.Caleb slaps his hands together deciding to just roll with it like a man, "Aight, fuggit, Moon pie gimme the oil vials.". he says before she give him a vial and both girls take their positions.'When did my life become tags on Hentai haven?', Caleb thought swirling the vial of liquid....A few minutes later..."HAAHHHH!", "NNNGHAAAH!", both girl screams of ecstacy fill the room. Mirabelle's skirt was pulled up over her horse back exposing her plump rear pussy while Lyca had taken her shorts all the way off and tooted toned butt showing her pussy. Between them Caleb used both open palms to massge plenty of oil onto their clits simultaneously. Their loins had immediately became a magma crater of pleasure as the oil kickstarted their sensitivity into maximum overdrive. They flailed, gasped and shriek in delight gripping Caleb's mattress for support to combat to surges of ecstacy. Even Caleb could barely contain his moans as his palms has become catylists that sent waves of ecstacy through his arms. Soon, Caleb started to find his rhythm with the girls. He inserts one finger each to their love canals sending them both into louder screams of pleasure. It's realllly convinient the walls are sound proof now."*pant* *pant* HNNNGAHAH...Chief. Dis ish amazing. It's a MILLION times bebber than earlier!", Lyca panted tongue out drooling slight and tail twitching and he scrapes her walls churning her juices and the oil into her pulsating flesh."HAAHGgh! I..I didn't AAH think it would be THIS strong AHaaagghh. I'm already going mad! My phany(british for 'vagina') is melting into mush AHAAHAA!", Mirabelle shouted clenching the sides of her head and her hip rock back and forth drenching wanting to feel even more."G-Glad ya'll ah like it. Cuz It's...about to get more intense up in here.", Caleb uttered before inserting his middle and ring fingers into each of them. The girls throw their heads back shriekoing as Caleb vigorously pumps them both with the precision of engine pistons stirring the love juices into dripping puddles onto the carpet. The sloppy, wet sloshing as he prodded and scraping their pussies coupled with their disjointed gasps and moans in sheer unabated pleasure fill the room.So much so, that they didn't even notice the pair of lime green glowing eyes watching them from the cracked door.It was Zwei standing in her PJs consisting of an oversized white t-shirt with Chinese symbols that reach down past her knees and nothing else. Having wanted to come back to return Caleb's PS4 controller she accidentally took only take catch ear to the sounds of pleasure down the hall and has been watching ever since. She smirks watching Caleb go to work on the wolf and horse. Quite impressed he's handling two at once fairly well. It wasn't long before she felt the familiar itch in her loin and reaches down to scratch it.'Hehehe, round two baby.', Zwei thought smirking as she touches herself."OH gods! NNNGHA It's too much! Dear, I'm cumming!", Mirabelles stated digging her nails into the blanket."AHHAA Me too! Me too! L-Let's cum for Chief together Mira! Together! Watch us Cheif!", Lyca stated deliriously taking Mira's hand who accepts."OK LYCA! H-HAAAHHHHHHHH!", "NNNAHHHHHGGH!", both girls shouted as their heavy orgasms hit simultaneously spraying all over Caleb's arms, carpet, and part of his face. The two girls collapse their limp bodies on the bed as Caleb take the opportunity to wipe off his arms and face with the shirt draped on the chair. He pauses in thought before discreetly tasting the sweet mixture of their love nectar on his finger. His body lightly trembles at the sensation as purple glow appears then fades in his eyes."Haaa...that was phenomenal Dear.", Mirabelle hummed raising up.'Yeahhh...my insides are still all tingly.", Lyca utters rolling over on her back."Heh, g-glad you girls liked it so much That oil...is some crazy strong shit. So you guys wanna stop here or...?", he spoke moves over to them only for Mirabelle to stand up gripping his arm."Stop? what ever for Dear?", Mirabelle inquires her purple heart filled pupils staring lovingly as she pressing her breasts against him."That's right!", Lyca added clinging to him as well looking up with Amber heart filled pupils, "~Now it's your turn.~"Caleb gulps before both girls push him to the bed allowing his throbbing rockhard to stand before their eyes. Mirabelle takes the left, Lyca the right as they crawl up to his waist grinning lascioviously."~I've still got a little bit left in this vial JUST for you Dear.~", Mirabelle teases dangling the vial into view as Lyca pants in excitement. Caleb eyes widen realizing he was in danger. She opens the vial pouring it's contents onto Caleb bare member and some on his abs.Caleb immediately feels the his manhood reach dangerously high levels of pleasure and sensitivity. He arches groaning in unbridled passion the second Mirabelle drags hot, wet tongue from shaft to tip. Lyca follows her lead before lingering on the tip and taking the head in her mouth swirling her tongue around then proceeding to bob her head humming blissfully. Mirabelle lets Lyca have his cock and focuses on massaging Caleb's oil covered abs with her breasts."Haaaa...HAAAAAA fuck...HhnNNNhhholy fucking shit.", Caleb moans huskily looking down at Mirabelle and Lyca both wholeheartedly pleasuring him. He reachs and gently stroking the tops of their heads much to their delight, "You haaa...you girls. I love you girls so much!""We love you too Dear!", "MMHMMPH!", Mirabelle and Lyca answered.'Me tooooo.', Zwei thought still masterbating to the scene....Elsewhere...The door opens to a hotel room and a familiar fanatical loli goat woman enters before shutting the door. A red aura appears as it locks itself. She chucks he small shoulder strap bag on the single bed. She sits on the bed hands in her lap and sighs. Her mind going back to her conversation with Mama Rose'....'Seriously? Do we really need to rely on them? Need I remind you they're barely even part of the organization. Not to mention they are unruly as hell.', Fantina stated to the elderly woman sitting at her desk enjoying her rigatoni dinner with a bottle of Vodka. Several human men in black suits and red rose pins on their suits stood by beside her.'Ahh, but need I remind YOU that my brother-in-law is in some redneck hospital because of his own vendetta and because you failed to stop him. We not only lost access to our superior firearms but now ICEP is closing in further on our trade routes. I hold you both equally responsible for that! Why does he keep you around anyway? He just brought you home like stray cat saying you are very skilled former ICEP agent but you do laze around and try to add more victims to this pedophile cults of yours hahehehe.", Mama Rose' finishes with a chuckled taking a swig of vodka as the men behind her laughed.Fantina glares furiously wanting to reach for her scythe. She stops feeling a presence behind her and glances to mirror above seeing a pair of glowing green eyes attached to a ripping red goo. Of course, she always has her 'pet' with her."You listen to me koza suka( russian for 'goat bitch')! I will give you one chance to redeem yourself. Go to their hideout and convince them to do the job. Don't worry, when money speaks, not the species, people listen.', She spoke as one of the men presented a red briefcase. One Fantina knew to well.'But that's...that's Nikolai's entire fortune! ', Fantina stated in shock."No worries, I'm he would do the same or do want all his efforts to go in vain?"Fantina wanted to retort but knew doing so would be pointless, "Where are they located?"Mama Rose' looks to one of her men and they approach Fantina handing her a map with a marker showing the path to follow.'Sources say they are based here in Georgia somewhere in that location. If you fail, you leave my business. And when i say leave, I mean leave.', she emphasizes as Fantina notices the red goo had slink past her dissolving part of her cloak before reforming behind Mama Rose in the shape of a red slime girl with menacing green eyes....flashback end..."Fuck!", Fantina cursed kicking the bag off the bed with her hoof. She groans in frustration clenching her eyes as she plops down on the bed staring up at the ceiling. She lies there taking short reflection of her life so far and wonders how it came to this. Was it before joining ICEP? Starting her crusade? Meeting Nikolai and joining the Malones? ...Sterling? That last thought made her remember seeing him in that parking lot weeks ago. If he saw her, what would he say now.She raises up shaking her head, "No. It doesn't matter now. Nikolai may not be here but I not giving up on my goal. I'll use the Malones just a little bit longer until then. But first...""I have to pay you assholes a visit...Komanda Monstra(Monster Hitman Team)".....WRHey Fam! How's everyone been doing today? ...Ok, imma be honest i meant to upload this chapter last week but...things have kept me busy. I've had to return home. My mom has been very sick lately. NOT with what you think though, I promise, she tested negative. But, doctors did find some unusual growth in her lungs and lymph nodes on her neck that have made it difficult to breath at times. Last Thursday, I awoke at 3am to...her almost dying. I called 911 but it looked like she was going to go right then and there. She kept telling me all this stuff and...sigh. That experience shook me and I wasn't able to do...anything for a while but worry about her. I lost watched my grandmother die when I was 12, then I watched my father die when i was 16, I WASN'T about to watch my mother die at 25. Right now, she's doing ok. My siblings, everyone else in my family, and myself are awaiting the results from the doctors. We're praying it's benign and treatable. We all love her.I'm sorry...to unload all that baggage on you guys. You came to read a good story but it's more than that to me. I do my best to show that in each chapter with every character. I'm still writing Camilla's chapters and they will be up soon. I'll do my best to keep that promise. That's all I have to say for now. I hope everyone is staying safe in these tumultous times. But know, as long as i'm writing, everyone has a home here. All lives matter at the end of the day.See you next time, Peace Fam.
  
    Chapter Text
    Chapter 30: Devils in the DetailsA couple days pass after Caleb and Lyca's date and things were fairly normal in the Bizzell household. Caleb went on to work the next day and presented his completed project for his engineering team while, despite the...activity he shared with Moon pie and Lyca, he strangely didn't feel fatigued or even drowsy the next day. Good thing too, since all the time he spent on the project meant his entire weekend was now completely free!...Saturday morning...Caleb was soaking in the rectangular pool-sized bathtub with a thick, opaque bubblefoam surrounding him from his axe bodywash. He sat in thought enjoying the heat of the pool as steam wafts throughout the room. He was still wrapping his mind on what to do for him and Camilla's date. He mostly preoccupied all week a hardly had time to think it over. Trouble is, he still doesn't know much about her. Lyca was easy since it was pretty obvious she's the outdoors type. But Camilla..."Hmmm, maybe a movie? No, that's lame and it's pretty early. Hmm, she did buy that case of art pens and she likes to sketch so...maybe an art museum? Sigh, I don't know. Where are we gonna eat after? Would it be offensive to take her to a Mexican restaurant?', Caleb pondered unable to decide on what to do." Everything alright Dear?", came the voice of Mirabelle from behind."Yeah, just trying to figure out wh-", Caleb pauses in realization jerking himself around seeing Mirabelle. She wore only a light purple towel wrapped around her upper body forming around her curves and give a good view of cleavage; her lower half was completely bare, "Wha?! When did you get in here? WHY are you in here?""I just stepped in Dear. You must not have heard me. ", She spoke coyly walking around to the lower section of the bath. Caleb raises an eyebrow at her hooves not making a single sound against marble tile floor. She steps into the water standing next to Caleb making sure to hold the towel close to her breasts, "And to answer your question, I may need some assistance bathing my...backside.", she spoke giving a flirtatious look gesturing to her shimmering purple coat."Don't you have a long brush they made for Centaurs for that?", Caleb inquires trying to stop his eyes from wandering."Y-Yes, b-but it appears it's...um...broken...in half.", Mirabelle uttered touching the side of her face innocently.Caleb gives a blank look immediately seeing through her charade, "There's nothing wrong with it is there? You just want to take a bath together.""Wha-n-no...", she tries to deny."Moon pie.", Caleb drones knowinglyMirabelle puffed her cheeks in slight annoyance, "Oh bullocks, yes...I want us to have a real bath together; like in the dreamscape. This is a brilliant setting don't you agree? I've always wanted to recreate that scene in every anime where two lovers share a bath together.""well shit *zoom* ...*zoom*", Caleb teleports away then returns hold a small hand brush from the bathroom cabinet, "all ya had to do was ask ya weeb.""You're a weeb.", she mutters before disrobing in front of Caleb. He gulps slightly seeing her glistening naked body from her round, perky creamy breasts to her shining velvety fur. Sure, he has gotten used to seeing her like this in the dreamscape AND the fact that they 'stepped up' their flirting game flirting lately, there are still moments like these that remind him how captivating she could be. Caleb stands up letting the towel around his waist sink into the water before wading over to her. She glances him up an down from his chubby but muscular physique to his...man...ness and bite her bottom in anticipation. Caleb lathers up the handbrush with soap and begins with her back legs; the front she could handle. She trembles slightly as he made he scrubbed her and decides to distract her herself, "S-So w-w-what were you thinking about Dear?""Oh... uh, I was just thinking about what to do for Camilla's date today. Haven't been able to come up with anything.", Caleb admits finishing up her legs then working along the top of her horse body tracing subs along her velvet-like fur."Haa...I-I see. W-Well, I-I'm sure she'll enjoyaaah any place you take her.", Mirabelle utters trying to stifle her moans."Yeah...maybe but I want us both to enjoy ourselves. I still don't know that much about her though.", Caleb says as he kneels getting to her horsey underbelly causing Mirabelle to shift slightly in embarassment mumbling something under her breath, "What was that?"Her face was flushed red in arousal as she looks away, "I-I saying...she likes drawing m-maybe take her s-somewhere inspirational ahh...a park or an aquarium or something."Caleb thinks for a second, "Hmm...an aquarium...yeah...yeah I think that could work Moon pie! Thanks.""A-Anytime Dear.", Mirabelle uttered with a small grin before eliciting a squeak the second the brush roughly glides against her rear, "N-Not so rough, Dear."Caleb stops his motions, "S-sorry babe, I'll just-", he tries to glide his hand up to back but she stops him."I-I didn't say stop! T-That area is still very dirty...so be gentler.", she says swaying her rear alluringly.Caleb gulps nervously but obliges, "Y-Yeah, of course.", he says grabbing a nearby towel and wringing it out.He lifts up her tail with wisps of odorless smoke wicking around him and putting her dark purple horse pussy into full view. He hesitates a second noticing Mirabelle watching in anticipation before gliding the soapy towel up and around her womanhood and butthole. She lets a moan escape her lips as she feels him pawing at her flower arousing her greatly. Caleb tries to focus on just cleaning her. Trouble is, he was rockhard right now and positioning himself to allow their...regions not to touch. Suddenly, Mirabelle instinctively steps backwards and, for a second, his member brushes against her lips sending sparks of electricity between them. They pause for a moment taking in the sensation. Mirabelle closes her eyes and steps back against beginning to grind her lips against his shaft. Caleb's shot open in realization.*zoom* He teleports in front of her to her surprise and disappointment, "Whoa Whoa! Moon pie what...what are you doing?!""I'm sorry, Dear! I'm so sorry, I...I don't know what came over me. I...", Mirabelle stated with pleading eyes shamefully looking down at the waters." Sigh, lt's alright. Nothing...we didn't...sigh look, it's fine. Ok, we stopped that's.. what matters...", Caleb says conceding his junk with his hand.'I didn't want to stop though.', Mirabelle thought to herself before feeling a hand caress her face and looks into Caleb's brown eyes."It's ok. I know how you feel...believe me but ICEP-""I know! Caleb...I know.", Mirabelle interrupts."I hate it too. But I love you and won't risk losing you!", Caleb assured his forehead to hers to which she cups his face lovingly enjoying the tender moment. She then feels him pull away, "I think I'm clean enough I'm gonna head out and get dressed.""No wait! 10 more minutes, please? I haven't even gotten to wash your back yet.", Mirabelle stated grabbing his hand."We ain't in no Japan, Moon pie. Besides, I already washed my back. It's good.", Caleb replies."Awww, don't be so obtuse Dear. Pretty please.", she says mimicking Lyca's puppy eyes and mushing her breasts together. Caleb's heart skips a beat at the cuteness."Ughhh, fine. Don't say I didn't warn you.", Caleb stated to Mirabelle's delight. They sit down in the water with Caleb facing away from her as she rings out a fresher towel and dabbing a little soap on it. As she begins dragging the towel along his back she notices the little black spots along the upper part of Caleb's back."Hmm, how curious. Dear, I didn't know you had spots on your skin. It was always clearer in the dreamscape.", Mirabelle inquires"Hahhh they're called acne scars Moon pie. Most Human get them during puberty and they either go away or stay with you for life. Don't worry, I already know how ugly it looks. You don't gotta say nothin'", Caleb say in slight annoyance and embarassment."Ugly?! They're a part of you Dear! I love you and that includes every part of you. Besides, I think they're kind of adorable.", Mirabelle assured mushing her breasts into his back surprising Caleb in two different ways. She kisses his neck, "You're like an adorable little...um...what do you call those giggling dogs in Africa?""Hyenas?", Caleb answered raising an eyebrow."That's it! You're my hyena. My adorable bean-headed hyena!", Mirabelle exclaims happily mushing her soapy breasts into his back."Hah! That's a new one. Gotta tell Uncle Junior later.", Caleb chuckles tickling her ear eliciting a giggle from her. God he loved this woman. He wished he could fully express that to her but, he knew, he had no right to do so when she doesn't even know who he truly is. ICEP rules have been a convenient excuse but...how long will that last?...After their bath, Caleb and Mirabelle got dressed and joined everyone else for their usual routine of breakfast and banter. Caleb and Camilla once again tried outcooking each other; Camilla won...again. After a delicious breakfast of chicken, waffles, fresh fruit, and turkey bacon, Mirabelle and, surprisingly, Zwei helped with cleaning up as Camilla left to change clothes as she didn't want to go out smelling like food. Zwei and Lyca begin setting up the PS4 in the living room while Ein goes next door with Drei and Mirabelle finishes putting away the dishes. Caleb hears a knock at the door already expecting who it is.He opens the door and sees a woman dressed in standard ICEP uniform; black suit, white shirt, black tie, and ICEP insignia badge displayed on her hip. Her long auburn hair kept in ponytail, and large single sky blue eye taking up the center of her head."Good morning Mr. Bizzell, I'm Agent Monika and I will be housesitting on your behalf today. Here are my identification forms, registration, passport showing my status as such", The monoeye lady spoke graciously presenting a manilla folder with all her documents. It made sense, Caleb thought, ICEP needed their working to slowly regain their validity and credibility."Alright, come in. I'm just waiting for ward to join me.", Caleb replies allowing her inside. Before he could close the door, Ein and Drei stop him before walking inside as well."Señor? Who is this?", Camilla asks suspiciously as Caleb turns his attention to the demoness. She wore white comfort fit jeans that accentuated her thighs and plump rear, open toes leather embroidery shoes with no socks. Her top was a black Mexican-style peasant blouse embroidered with multicolor flowers lining the chest which formed perfectly around her mountainous breasts and showed good amount of cleavage. Caleb blushes then clears his throat as the Elder Devil glares at slightly nervous monoeye."Ahem, this is uh Agent Monika. She'll be watching things while you and I are on our "field trip".", Caleb says using the codeword for 'date' in the presence of other ICEP agents."N-Nice to meet you.", Monika says trying to shake hands to which Camilla quickly looks her up and down unimpressed."Hmm. Ah, Señora Mirabelle, I need to with ju a moment.", Camilla says walking away leaving the agent hanging before leading Mirabelle into the hallway for a private conversation."Hehe don't...take it personally agent Monika. She's just cautious of outsiders.", Caleb says."Or anyone with a Jesus tattoo.", Drei commented."Ok, I held my tongue long enough. Seriously?! Agent MONika? What was EYE-leen busy hahahaha?", Zwei chuckles slapping her leg before a lemon goes flying and hits her in the head, "Ow!""Sis, be nice. She's a fresh recruit given an assignment and as her superior YOU must set the example.", Ein stated juggling another lemon in one hand."I-I've been an agent for like three ye-", Monika tries to interject but is cut off"I don't even know WHY we need to stay in today. I got day pass too you know. Drei and I were gonna take Lycs and Mira out to today to see 'Deadpool 4' in theatres. Hell, if not that, SOMETHING besides sitting here getting babysat by American girl doll Polyphemus over here.", Zwei stated before the Monoeye lady give a blank look taking in the insult."Yeah! I kinda wanted to visit that place Mira talked about the other day. You know, with the gardener butterfly ladies and plant ladies giving out sweet food. We should go there-", Lyca says before getting cut off"NO!", Ein shouted slamming her palms hard against the counter making everyone except Drei jump as an awkwardly silence fills the room. Ein clears her throat and composes herself, "Ahem, I mean, y-you guys don't wanna waste your time there. It's boring there, really, really boring hehehe. Nothing candy and flowers, so boring."Zwei and the rest give her skeptical looks as she smile off the awkwardness. She then feels a tug on her dress and looks to see Drei with a blank look on her face."Outside, let's talk.", Drei says. Ein excuses herself and walks out the front door with Drei. At the same time, Mirabelle and Camilla emerge from the hallway with the former having an inquisitive expression."What's that tall weasel shouting about now?", Camilla inquires."Not sure, but it may have something to do with that flower place you guys went to.", Caleb.Camilla snorts a giggle "J-Jes, perhaps. I am ready now Señor. Shall we go?""Yeah, let's go.", Caleb says as Camilla follows him out the door with Monika tailing behind to see them out. The second they get out to the lawn Ein and Drei approach them."U-um, Mr. Bizzell?", Ein spoke reluctantly, "I would like for Drei to join me today.""Oh, alright then. You sure you don't wanna stay with agent Monika today?", Caleb inquires."As much as I'd like the privilege of hazing the new meat-""I'm not new! I've been an agent for three-""I feel I'm MUCH more needed with you.", Drei ignores shooting a look to Ein who blushes a little in embarassment."Alright, cool. Uhh, emergency numbers on the fridge, food is stocked IN the fridge, don't let them go in my office.", Caleb says walking over to his car opening the door for Camilla as she thanks him on his politeness. He then gets in and starts the car as Ein and Drei nod to him and disappear with a flash wind, "See y'all later."Caleb pulls the driveway as Agent Monika waves him off before taking a deep breath and going inside. She walks in and finds Zwei and Lyca talking and laughing as Zwei showed her how to play Borderlands 3. Mirabelle sat on the couch reading some of the new manga she recently bought."Hê!(Hey! in Thai), newbie, get us some meaty snacks will ya?! No cold cuts!", Zwei demands."Beef jerky!", Lyca stated excitedly."Beef jerky for Lycs!""Hahhh, ok.", Agent Monika sighs shoulders slumping as she walks to the kitchen. The nightmare begins.Speaking of nightmares, Mirabelle sat trying to read to manga but couldn't quite focus. Not from Zwei and Lyca's gamer noises but thinking of the favor Camilla asked of her before leaving. A part of her didn't want to say 'yes' but...she trusted her. She knew Camilla wouldn't try taking things to far...right? Right?...Caleb and Camilla continued the drive to their destination; which Caleb decided to keep secret until they arrived as a surprise. The two of them made casual small talk trying dispell any uncertainties they had. She seemed to enjoy Caleb's "human music" that he played using the aux cord. Incidentally, she really enjoyed a song he played called 'Forget you' by Cee lo Green and even tried humming along with melody and found some of the lyrics humurous. Caleb had the privilege of hearing the cutest laugh he ever heard Camilla make.Eventually they arrive in Madison, a quaint suburban town 20 minutes from Huntsville. As they drove through, Camilla looked around at the many residential homes, shops, and large public parks. As they continued, the houses and buildings became prevalent as did the number of humans and liminals; leading Camilla to becoming more wary of their surroundings. Finally, they arrive at their location. A large dome-shaped building with white tiling, revolving doors and a glowing multicolored geyser out front. As they park, Camilla looks at the building sign that featured blue ocean waves and what looked like turtle holding a white and red flag in it's mouth. Even the fountain appeared to be a giant dolphin. She looks to Caleb questioningly who smiles at her."Surprise! It's an aquarium date!""Ah, hmmm.", Camilla uttered in thought.Caleb's smile slowly fades, "Ok...was hoping for...something more...I don't know.""N-No! No, Señor...I'm just not sure how to feel. I have never been to one of these places before. An aquarium is one of those glass boxes ju humans keep fish as pets correct?""Well yeah, but this is something wayyyy bigger and much cooler. Come on, I'll show ya.", Caleb assures her before getting out of the car. They walk together to the front entrance and get their admission tickets and guide pamphlet from the receptionist. All the while, Camilla ignores the weird or disdainful looks from random humans.Atop one of the buildings, Ein was observing all the passersbys. Drei appears besides her."Nothing suspicious, except a guy who really likes shopping at Lady's Foot Locker.", Drei stated dumping five gift cards from her sleeve."Good", Ein says then giving an inquisitive look to her, "You know, I could've handled this on my own. I'd rather you stayed with Zwei today.""Maybe, but I'd rather be here. Besides, I will tell the rest about you getting the yuri treatment by a butterfly and a flower", Drei replied making Ein wince with blush."HOW did you even find out about that?! I made Ms. Sartana swear to keep that a secret.", Ein thought about what she said for a moment, "She told you didn't she?""No, you just talk in your sleep.", Drei says, "Besides, that candy I saw you stress eating that night was really, really good.""Yeah...it was", Ein regretfully admitted before seeing Caleb and Camilla go into the building, "T-They're going inside! Tail them!""It's what I born for.", Drei spoke before stealthily leaping down the building whipping up a gust of wind. Ein prepares to follow before reaching into the opening of her cleavage and pulling out of small pouch of Alraune candy. She take out a piece enjoying the incredibly natural sweetness and honey-like texture that felt like her mouth was being massaged by a Thai massues. It was like eating pleasure in it's concentrated form."Haaa...almost make the physiological scars worth it.", Ein hums before whipping up a small whirlwind and vanishing with blinding speed....Camilla's eyes widen looking around the large open three floor area and enormous glass walls filled clear water decorated with different colored coral, deep see rocks, and underwater plants. Numerous fish of varying species could be seen swimming around. Camilla looks above to see large interlocking glass tubes connected to each of the tanks with fish swimming through like water bridges. There were large displays of model fish, turtles, plankton and other forms of sea life and different colored ornamental starfish and seahorses hanging on the wall. Human families taking pictures or just curiously observing the tanks along with a few liminals with their hosts. There were corridors labeled with different names like 'Shark city' or "Manta ray mania" and escalators leading to the second and third floors."So, whaddya think?", Caleb smirks gently nudging her shoulder, "Your 'wow' factor appears to be up."" Heh, I do not know about my 'wow factor', but I am rather intrigued. I have never seen so many fish in one place and so many kinds. It is beautiful.", Camilla spoke looking around."Yeah. Don't get too overwhelmed now, can't have my date passing out from exhaustion already.", Caleb teased."Huhu, well if I did, ju would support me, right?", Camilla teased back with a devilish smirk."Heh, of course that's a...partners job...hehe", Caleb feeling a little awkward saying it only for Camilla to smile appreciating the effort he was making. Caleb then clears his throat noticing the group of people approaching behind them, "Alright let's move they way and go to...Oh! How bout we start with the seahorses then...go check out the river otter enclosure? Cool, I never seen real otters before.""That would make both of us, Señor. Lead the way.", Camilla gesturing Caleb to proceed onwards.As they walked together down the corridor titled 'Seahorse kingdom' while ignoring the weird looks from some of the patrons. Drei and Ein were stealthily hiding and observing the surrounding patrons. Drei tails Caleb disguised as a small human child with yellow hat covering her ear and tail wrapped around her waist like a sash. Ein didn't bother questioning WHERE she got the clothes from.Caleb and Camilla enjoyed their time in Seahorse kingdom getting to see the different species of seahorses in their beautifully decorated tanks. Camilla was shocked to learn from one of the audio guides in the area that male seahorses are the ones to give birth. She was even more shocked getting to see a couple that WERE actually pregnant to which Caleb made a joke about male menopause. It cracked her up. After that, they went over to the other enclosure where the staff it was time for their daily feeding so all of the little brown fur sausages were really active. It was a large open pool-like enclosure with rocky terrain for the otters to rest and artificial sea plants. Camilla and Caleb admired the adorable yipping water weasels as they swam about splashing and climbing the mini rock terrain. At one point, one of the staff offered the observers the chance to pet them as they swam by assuring they were perfectly tame to which the pair immediately jumped on board. They each enthusiastically got to pet the otters enjoying their fluffy, soft and wet fur. At one point, one of the little otters played with Camilla sweetly nibbling at her fingers and doing little splashes as it yipped happily at her. As Caleb watched from the side smiling at the demoness laughing and enjoying herself, he noticed a couple other observers staring at them in disapproval. He didn't give two craps about them but discreetly shot warning glares at one guy with his phone out that said "You try start some shit and I'll beat that ass."After getting their fill of water weasel cuteness, they decided to visit the tropical fish canal. It was large, dimly lit tunnel with the only light being the shimmering blue waters and the thousands of fish from different corners of the world. Everything from tetras to glofish made up this cascade of colors. Camilla watched in wonder at the spectacle the looks to the man, her Destino (Destined one), beside her who smiles at her. She feels her heart palpitate. It's BEEN skipping beats since they arrived. She looks down at his hand wanting to feel closer to him but kept retracting uncertain of herself or if that's what he wanted. Her fears were quickly dashed the second she feels him take her hand interlocking their fingers together before he gives a slightly awkward but caring smile. She smiles back feeling her cheeks hearing up.They soon left the canal and came across another exhibit with five large interconnected tanks called 'Shark Works' with three different species of sharks found along Alabama gulf shores. The entire area was dark save for the bright blue light of the tanks In the center of the room were benches for viewing the tanks. Caleb and Camilla approach one of the tanks seeing a small sign that said 'Blacktip sharks with information on it. They could see 3 fairly large sharks swimming around the tank."How pretty", Camilla uttered speechlessly."Really?", Caleb inquires, "That's a first I heard someone call sharks 'pretty' ""Jes Señor, I have only ever seen imágenes( pictures) of them in books. Seeing one up close like dis...", Camilla spoke her gaze transfixed on the majestically swimming animals."Look mommy! Lady bat!"Caleb and Camilla look to see a little dark skin 4-year-old human girl smiling pointing to Camilla wings. The demoness looks at her curiously."Jasmine! Jasmine get over here!", stated the girl's dark skin mother who proceeds to yank her child away shooting a look at Camilla and Caleb."It's fine miss, she's not bothering us. If you wanted to join us that's fine. Nothing to be afraid of.", Caleb intervenes taking Camilla hand in his to her surprise."No, that's fine, we was just leaving!", She cuts him off shooting him a disapproving look."But I want see shark", the girls as her mother hurries her out of the area."We'll come back later when they gone.", she says to her daughter.Caleb shakes his head before noticing a couple other people who heard the commotion leave out as well staring at him and Camilla. He turns to Camilla who was standing in silence looking at the tank."Camilla?", he says."I am fine Señor.", Camilla assures before turning away and taking a seat at one of the benches. Caleb sits down next to her giving a concerned look but also trying to remain supportive, "None of that meant anything.", she spoke coldly looking forlornly at the other shark tanks..Caleb leans back against bench looking up at the dark ceiling, "Well...it means a lot to me", he spoke before Camilla turns a curious ear toward him, "I hate that kind of shit. They don't know you or anything about you but they still treat you like they have your entire criminal history on hand. They have no right to judge you like that."Haaa...I understand Señor but ju cannot change the collective mindsets of human astigmatism. Humans have despised mi gente since the days of the Christian missionaries. There is no undoing centuries of proselytistic beliefs." Camilla replies coldly crossing her legs leaning back."Still...I don't believe you deserve that treatment. Even if I don't know much about you still.", Caleb says."Hm, maybe you'd say otherwise if you knew who I am. Perhaps I seem kinder now, but I was not always like dis.", Camilla spoke with no hint of care."What do you mean?", Caleb inquires looking her curiously."I have always had a violent temper. It became easier to control as a got older but I have...done things in my youth. It still slips out every now and again. You have only seen a fraction of my malice Señor. Ju do not want to see mi true face", Camilla warns as Caleb thinks back to the full moon and her fight with Azaeli.Caleb goes silent for a moment, "I...I can't pretend I fully understand you Camilla and maybe you are hiding stuff about yourself. Believe I understand that feeling. The past always back to bite you. But listen, whatever things you did back then...it's done. There's no going back there's only moving forward. Whoever you were back then doesn't matter to me."Camilla gives him a surprised look, "Señor...""The woman I see right now, is smart, brave, kind, a total badass by all definitions...and can dance circles around me in the kitchen. She saved my life, twice, and protected moon pie and lyca.", Caleb cheekily spoke eliciting a giggle from the demoness. She scoots closer until their shoulder were barely an inch apart. Caleb takes her hand and looks deeply into her intimidating yet enchanting red eyes, "Not to mention, she's...one of the most beautiful women I ever met."Camilla smiles and blushes as her tail begins to snake across Caleb's lower back making him flinch at the intrusion. She smirks in satisfaction, "Gracias Señor."Caleb gulps and cracks a nervous grin turning back to the tanks, "Y-You know, Devils are actually kinda like the sharks here.", Caleb says before Camilla raises an eyebrow, "What I mean is, you're both tragically misunderstood and feared by most due to stigmas and romanticized bullshit from Hollywood. Sure some can straight up kill a grown ass man if they wanted but most are fairly chill. At the end of the day, they're just...big fish doing what they were born to do. We shouldn't hate them for it. Devils are kinda the same way."Camilla touches her chin pensively, "Hmm, that is an interesting way to look at it. Except last time I checked I did not have gills and scales Señor", she facetiously grins."Eh, just my two scents.""Huhu, but there is one thing mi gente have common with sharks.", she says as she leans against his shoulder with her tail wriggling against his back. Caleb shifts from the sensation, "we are both man eaters", She whispers flirtatious before nibbling his ear.Caleb blushes trembling at the sensation as he feels her soft thigh press against him, "H-Hey! Don't you wanna check out the other shark tanks?""~Hmm, I'm fine just sitting here. I have the perfect view from where we are, mi Destino.~", Camilla smirks devilishly pressing her breasts against his arm giving a good view of her cleavage. Caleb shifts his gaze."A-Alright, up to you, we can chill here for bit.", Caleb uttered sheepishly playing dumb to what she was doing, "Geez, we're surrounded by sharks somehow we're the frenzy.""Huhuhu, you're a dork Señor", Camilla chuckles contently."I know.", Caleb jokingly rolls his eyes.Hiding in the darkness, Ein was watching and listening to them.The two of them spend the rest of their time watching the sharks swim around and talking shit about that lady from earlier.After leaving the shark exhibit, the two of them were at a loss for what to do next and opted to just walk around and see what catches their interest. They ended up on the second floor then came across a bunch of mermaids, Crab girls, and Scylla being escorted by ICEP personnel. They learned that the mermaids from Interspecies Affairs are putting on a musical performance in a few hours and it was free to the public. They decide to definitely check it out so wanted to find something to kill time." Hmm, I don't know, we could go check out the turtle exhibit.", Caleb says looking at the guide pamphlet walking with Camilla."I do not care for turtles. They retract their limbs and heads into their wrinkled, scaly bodies. Es tan raro y extraño(so creepy and weird) ", Camilla answer cringing slightly from the thought."I like turtles. Their low maintenance and they live a long time.", Caleb replies."Ugh, do not remind me. Knowing they can also keep up with me in age as well...", Camilla reviles in disgust."Oh I don't know. If you reallllly tried you could outlive them.", Caleb replies earning a dry glare from her."Ju know I have been experimenting with a spell that gives the sensation of being hit in the groin every time ju blink. Mind helping me test it, Señor?", Camilla smiles sadistically speaking with slight venom.Caleb cringes waving his hands in defense, "Ok ok, I'm sorry, Geez.""Hoho Buen chico(Good boy).", Camilla grins proud of the pants she's wearing. Suddenly, her stomach makes a rumble before Camilla blushes in embarassment. Caleb then points out the food court on the map."Will mi...uh...dulce amor(am I saying it right?) accept a peace offering of delicious food and good company?", Caleb graciously offers showing off his subpar Spanish.Camilla giggles appreciating his attempt at her language and decides to mess with him, "Acepto, lidera el camino mi tonto querido(I accept, lead the way my silly little sweetheart.)Caleb pauses, "I'll take that as a yes.", he says before Camilla bursts into laughter as they continue to the food court.Suddenly, a familiar voice calls out to them."Camilla-sama? Camilla-sama is that you?! Over here!"Caleb and Camilla look to see a blue-skinned Lesser Devil girl standing near the fossilized sea-life section signalling to them with both hands. She excitedly runs over to them as Caleb and Camilla get a better look at her then proceeds to levitate in the air. Their eyes widen in realization of who she was. Camilla smiles, it was Hana! Camilla catches her in a hug as the two Devils embrace getting the attention of a few bystanders. Ein and Drei are seen observing from a distance watching the situation determining if she is a threat or not."Pequeña!", Camilla happily exclaims before letting her down as they smile widely at each other. Hana turn to Caleb. Before he could process it, she's hugging his torso tight nuzzling his lower tummy. Camilla and Caleb both recoil seeing she wasn't quite tall enough for her face to reach past his belt line. Basically, nuzzling his crotch much to Caleb's immense embarassment."Caleb-kun! I'm so happy to see you again!", She says her voice slightly muffled."Y-Yeah nice to see you too! You can uhh stop that now. Like right now.", Caleb gently pushing her off glancing at the passerby giving him weird looks. He then notices the demon girl looking up with saddened eyes."Eh? What's wrong Caleb-kun, don't you remember me? I'm Hana , you know, when we were in the motel together-""Yes! Yes, our field trip right! Of course I remember Hana.", Caleb spoke attempting to diffuse the judgmental stares of the strangers around them. Damn nosy-ass vultures.Hana gives him a puzzled look before noticing the people around them, "O-Oh! Right of course. Field trip.", she winks at Caleb who sighs softly."Why are ju here anyway miha?", Camilla inquiresHana perks up, "Oh, me and the girls are visitors on this aquatic liminal musical performance sponsored by Interspecies Affairs. I kinda got bored and decide to check out some of the weird fossils all display.""Ah ok, WE were going to check that out la-wait. What do you mean the gir-?", Caleb is quickly cut off by another."Hana? Why'd you run off Hana?! You dropped your banDAna. Ha!", chortled a Greater devil woman as she twirls a blue bandana in one finger. She then pauses her eyes widening see the two very familiar faces."Um der Dunkelheit willen (For Darkness sake) Sharon, don't you go running off...too?", the silver-haired Greater(Heidi) starts but then trails off upon seeing Camilla and Caleb. They're then join by three more Greater Devils( Jocelyn, Sylvia, and Scarlett)."What are you guys staring at any-", Jocelyn, along with Sylvia and Scarlett, stop upon seeing Caleb and Camilla."Arrrre they alri-", Caleb started before all five Greater Devils lunge towards them at supernatural speed and startling Caleb and a few passersbys."CAMILLA!", Scarlett and the rest exclaimed surrounding the Elder Devil."¡MIS NIÑAS!(MY GIRLS!)", Camilla stated group hugging the Greater Devils like a mom greeting her children from summer camp. As they laugh and chattered happily, Caleb becomes nervous at the strangers beginning to stare at them with contempt or disgust. He then sees the pure happiness on Camilla's and the Greater Devils faces and couldn't help smiling himself. He shoots a few taunting smirk at some of the haters as they quickly avert their attention away from them."And Caleb-kun is here too!", Hana cheerfully gesturing to Caleb like she's showing off a trophy."No I ain't!", Caleb stated waving her off. It was too late. Sylvia and a few others look over to him with devilish smiles forming, "ohhh hell.", Caleb utters.Sylvia, Heidi, Jocelyn, and Sharon talking him into a soft, pillowy group hug as he struggles get free. Scarlett gives a ponderous look wanting to join in but was still cautious."This is great! We got Camilla AND out little cuttie hero with us!", Sharon stated mushing her breasts into Caleb's arm. He blushes."Here I thought we'd be bored until the show started.", Jocelyn presses against his side playfully poking his cheek as he recoils in embarassment. Camilla feels a pang in the back of her mind giving a strained grin.Suddenly, Ein appears before them brandishing her scythes."Alright, disperse!", She stated getting Sharon and the rests attention, "I am Agent Ein of ICEP! Slowly step away from Mr. Bizzell at once!""Oh cállate idiota comadreja!(Oh shut up you idiot weasel), they are not a threat! They are mis amigas! Put those butterknives away!", Camilla warned as Ein gives a puzzled look. Caleb pulls away from the Sharon and the others."Yeah, Ein, it's cool. I know them, they're the girls. You know, from that night on the fourth of July?", Caleb says raising an eyebrow. Her eyes widen in realization then retracts her scythes back into her arms."A-Apologies. Please forgive my impudence. ", she utters with a polite bow."Easy there miss Miyagi, it's all good.", Sharon stated brushing it off before turning back to Caleb and Camilla, "Any what are you guys doing here?""Well Camilla and I were just heading over to the food court and grab something to eat until the show starts.", Caleb replies."*GASP* That's where we were headed before Hana wandered off. You guys should join us! Like right now", Sylvia stated with a bubbly energy."Like that's even needs to be said! Come on Camilla, Cuttie, join us!", Sharon statedCaleb and Camilla glance at each other."Well, actually. It's kinda supposed to be just Camilla and me today so-Ah!.", Caleb says before Sharon lock arms pulling him towards her.Sylvia grabs the other arm giving a devilish, "Yeah, come on, we're not strangers or anything. It's all good.""That's exactly what Leeroy Jerkins thought.", Caleb says"Who's Leeroy Jerkins?", Hana inquired"Exactly-gah alright easy!", Caleb stated as the Greater Devils pulled him off to food court; even pressing themselves against him to his continued embarassment.Camilla winces at the sight and was about to say something but Ein beat her to it."H-Hey now, we are still out in public and you should conduct yourselves accordingly!", the weasel reprimanded following behind them.Camilla shakes her head at her the feels someone take her hand looking down to Hana's demonic yet innocent eyes."Please join us Camilla-sama! We all want to know what you've been up to.", she says as Jocelyn Heidi, and Scarlett nod in agreement.Camilla smiles, "Ohoho, believe me, I have been busy."She follows the group along to the food court. All the while, Scarlett observed her noticing she seemed...different the last time they seen her; more...awake. Not just her, she felt a strange energy Caleb as well. Trusting her intuition, she remains observant; especially around Caleb. She won't make the same mistake with men regardless of their past relations.Drei watches from above the third floor as Ein follows them."Good, now to let nature take care of the rest.", she says before noticing a man following the group with his phone recording them. She takes out a small green pellet from her sleeve, aims it like shooting a marble, then fires. It hits the man's phone covering his phone in sticky green paste knocking it out his hand. He curses trying to get it off as Drei looks ahead, "Image protected."...The group managed to find a table to themselves and with hardly any people around. Well...there WERE a few people but they all picked up their food and moved to the other side of the food court the second they saw a large group of demons enter. Caleb and the rest didn't even let it bother them. They each got their food and a table and decide to enjoy the private space they now had. Ein convinced the I.A. worker chaperoning the girls into allowing her to watch them. Caleb was nice enough to buy Ein's food for her.They chatted and swapped stories. Each of the Devil girls took turns talking about what they've been up to since living under I.A. protection. Be it pursuing human standards of formal education, gaining workforce skills, or, in Scarlett case, receiving therapy treatment. Of course, they were a little hurt that Caleb had forgotten their names but laughed it off as he wasn't good with remembering names anyway. They told them about when their night out at the club where they beat up a pack of Orcs that were harassing them. Caleb and Camilla were pleased to hear how well they were at least doing well.The Devils girls immediately wanted to know what Caleb and Camilla have been up to. They were more than happy to inform them with Ein insuring they omit certain details for...security reasons."Whoaaa, so you're his bodyguard?", Hana inquires with twinkling eyes staring at Ein, "and there's THREE of you? Like clones?!""Er, yes but no.", Ein spoke with an embarrassed grin, "I am a part of fraternal triplets that for the perfect trinity of my species.""Hahaha es tut mier liet I cannot get over that you und you schwester are Asians but haf names from mein country.", Heidi chuckles."We're also half-American. Unpack that cultural diversity.", spoke Drei as Ein and rest look to see her at empty table next to them eating a Thai chicken rap after taking out the veggies."Are you her sister? Why are you so short?", Jocelyn asks as Ein shoots a glare at her"Why is anything short? Follow up, are you familiar with the concept of a bra?", Drei spoke in a dry tone referring to the generous amount of cleavage Jocelyn was sporting in her orange kingdom hearts shirt.Jocelyn hugs her chest with a grin, "Aww, but that's so restrictive. The natural way is always best. Hehe even our little hero agrees, right Cal? Yeah I caught you look", She winks at Caleb who tenses up as Camilla and the girls focus on him."I-wha- ju-haaahhh...ok, I was a little. Sorry about that.", Caleb apologizes sinking down shamefully. Scarlett watches his reaction unsure of what the make of it."Hehe don't be. ~I don't mind.~", Jocelyn smirks seductively pressing her breasts together as Caleb averts his gaze.Camilla feels another pang in the back of her mind forcing as cracks spread across her plate."Ok, but SERIOUSLY, that Angel that kidnapped you was a Fallen?!", Sharon stated in disbelief almost knocking over her parfait.Caleb sighs, "Yeah...black wings and whatnot and apparently she was an arms dealer for the criminals after me and other groups looking to gain recognition on the streets.""Ugh, I hate Fallen Angels. They're worse than the regular kind!", Sylvia stated in disgust."Stuck high-and-mighty bastards and bitches! Loss of status somehow creates an INCREASE in arrogance it seems.", Jocelyn spat."AND she's the one who gave them the fucking collars they put on us!", Sharon added aggressively biting into her fish fillet, "Camilla I hope you beat her ass into the next decade.""Ohhh trust me miha, she will never see next year or any other year ever again.", Camilla spoke coldly alarming Ein and the Devil girls."Why...is that, Camilla?", Scarlett inquires as Camilla upturns a serious gaze unnerving some of the girls. Ein rose up to intervene."She's dead.", Caleb spoke plainly as everyone turned to him in shock, "She unleashed this...huge ass explosion and tried to escape. But, she ended up crashing into a church and getting impaled on a metal cross. They ruled it as an accident. A happy little accident if you ask me.", Caleb explains eating the rest of his grilled tilapia.The girls look to him in silence before Hana speaks up."A-Are you alright Caleb-kun?", Hana says in a worried tone."Yep, could be better, now let's get off that and talk about something else", Caleb urges before they look between each other. Drei glances from behind then subtly gestures towards Ein."Y-Yes, it's a sensitive matter at the moment and it's best we move on. Anyone curious what the musical going to be like? I hope it's arcapella.", Ein says."Actually, what I'm curious about is you two.", Sharon playfully waggles her finger at Camilla and Caleb, "I don't know what is, you just seem...closer. I get that you're totally dating, that much is so obvy but you guys just...feel like you were made for each other. I'm not the only one who feels it right? Tell me I'm not crazy."Hana and the rest voice their agreement as Scarlett looks around surprised she isn't the only one who felt itCamilla lightly chuckles as they look on in confusion, "Jes, I suppose it makes sense it would feel that way. Señor IS my Destined One after all.", she emphasizes clasping her hand to the top of Caleb's.Before Caleb could debate anything the Devil girls shoot up from their seats."WHAAAAAAT?!", they scream in unison startling Caleb and the patrons on the other side of the food court inciting some to take their food and leave. Caleb rubs his ear before jumping when Joceyln slams her palms against the table."Are you guys serious?!", she stated."There's no way!", Sharon added in shock."Is it really true Caleb-kun?", Hana looks to him with hopeful eyes as do the rest."I...it's as she says but personally I'm still on the fence about the whole 'Destiny' thing. And by fence, I mean I don't believe in destiny at all", Caleb admits rubbing his head. Scarlett looks to him curiously."Then it's true!", Hana stated happily before turning to Camilla, "Camilla-sama, how did you find out?! How could you tell he was the one?", she inquires."Didn't you hear a word I said?", Caleb inquires."Yeah tell us! I wanna know too!", Jocelyn stated."Oh, guess I'm being ignored then, ok.", Caleb utters taking a sip of Diet Dr. Pepper as the others clammer to hear Camilla."S-Settle down niñas, I will tell ju.", she says as they focus and listen intently, "I did not realize until later but whenever I am near Señor, it is as if mi body, heart, soul, mi entire being reacts in unison crying out to be made whole. I felt it ever since that day in the warehouse and it has only gotten stronger since.", Camilla finished pulling Caleb towards her lovingly touching heads to his."Ughhhh this suuuucks! How'd you get so luckyyy?! A new home, no math assignments, AND you find your Destined One which is like a...BAZILLION TO ONE ODDS!", Sharon stated before putting her head to the table in anguish. Sylvia pats her back attempting to console her."It was not luck miha, it was fate. Ju will find your Destined One someday, all of ju. The chaotic power of Discord will find a way.", Camilla assures them as Caleb gives a look that said 'what the fuck are you talking about?'"Yeah but you realize you basically accomplished what most of our race could only DREAM of. I'm sorry but the jealousy is real Camilla.", Jocelyn says before a thought occurs to her, "Oh, now that I think about it, don't you live with Centaur and a...kobold I think. How did they react? Were they like suuuper jealous too.""Werewolf, actually, and it is an interesting story. Ju see we have-""Camilla wait!", Caleb interrupts as Camilla turns to him, "That's a private matter. We can't just telling anyone about that. Who knows who may be listening?""Oh you're good. I've been monitoring our surroundings this whole time.", Drei says taking a bite of chicken as Caleb shoots her a glare."Still, Mr. Bizzell, is right. No one outside of us and Agent Sterling can know about it. We're already taking a risk as is.", Ein agrees as Camilla looks to them in disbelief."I say go ahead. It's not they could have anything to really gain by know nor would they want to jeopardize their I.A. statuses. ", Drei warning tone."What exactly does she mean by that?", Scarlett inquires becoming visibly agitated."Nothing! Nothing at all. Right, Drei?", Caleb glares at her as she shrugs."Señor, it is ok.", Camilla assures him caressing his hand. Caleb looks into her soft eyes at a tug of war with himself. The side that decided to trust her won out."Sooooo what is it exactly you guys wanna tell us and why is it such a big deal?", Jocelyn inquires as the rest turn to Camilla and Caleb expectantly. Caleb glances at Ein, who wavers deciding to trust her sister knows what she's doing."Alright, so...it's basically like this.", Caleb started....A few minutes later...Scarlett, Hana and the other Devils sit flabbergasted their jaws agape trying to comprehend what they just learned. Caleb and Camilla had explained what happened prior to Caleb's kidnapping; the proposal of the multi-spousal marriage and how Caleb was now working to deepen his bond with his girls."So...yeah, that's kinda where we are now.", Caleb says, "Any questions?""Several!", Sharon stated, "So you're building your own version of our species harem?!""Keep your voice down!", "Gah, don't say it out loud!", Ein and Caleb simultaneously jerk from their seats to quietly shushing her. She quickly apologizes."Hahhh looks it's not like that all.", Caleb says."Kinda seems like it. So does this mean Camilla's your favorite of the bunch or is that title to one of the other girls.", Sylvia inquires as Camilla blushes looking to Caleb."N-No! No *sigh* look...I'm still knew to all of this. I tried to make it JUST about me and Mirabelle but...I couldn't deny any longer what I feel for Lyca and Camilla. It's not about FAVORITES, it's about loving each of them equally and loving what makes them unique.", Caleb lovingly touches Camilla arm to her surprise, "I'm just doing my best...for all of them.", he finishes as Camilla smiles adoringly at him. The devil girls watch amazed at the display; except Scarlett who gives a skeptical glare at Caleb."Loving them all equally?", Hana utters in a thoughtful tone."I didn't know that was even an option. It's never like that in my clan.", Sylvia says to herself."M-Maybe it's different with humans.", Jocelyn says looking to Caleb then biting her lip."*clears throat* Anyway, it's really, really important none of you tell anyone about this, please.", Caleb almost begs them."O-Of course we wouldn't! Right girls?", Hana stated as Jocelyn nod voicing their collective agreement, "We owe you so much. It's the very least we could do.", she says as Scarlett scoffs in disgust"Yeah, our lives are in your debt Cutie. We'll keep the promise no prob but...you deserve SO much more that just that.", Sharon spoke staring longingly at him as Jocelyn does the same. Camilla narrows her eyes at them. Scarlett gives an irritated glare not wanting or liking the idea of being indebted to this man."NO you don't!", Caleb stated surprising all of them, " None of you owe me a damn thing. All I want is your word. Nothing more. You are all sweet ladies and I'm happy you're all doing so wonderfully on your own. That's all that should matter, to me at least. So...I trust you'll keep our relationship at secret."Camilla grins sweetly and Hana and the rest stare at the human their hearts warmed by the selflessness and genuine care for them. Ein couldn't help smiling as Drei nods in approval. Even Scarlett was profoundly shocked by his kindness."Of course, Caleb-kun", Hana shifts, "Um, Caleb-kun?""You can just call me 'Caleb', don't need the 'kun'. I ain't no popcorn mascot.", Caleb replies taking a swig of DD Pepper."Hehe, right, Caleb. Um...after I finish the GED program for liminals and get citizenship...I...", Hana blushes then touches her claws together nervously, "A-And it's ok if you say 'no'. I...I would like to join your harem."Caleb gets drinks strangled on his drink coughing as Camilla, Ein, and the Devil girls jaws drop. Drei raise an amused eyebrow. Camilla pants Caleb's back as he assures he was ok."M-Me too!", Jocelyn stated raising up throwing her hat in the ring, "When I finish my message therapy training, I'd like to join too. ~I'll even give you a free session.~", she smirk with a flirtatious tone as Ein tells her to lower her voice."I'd like to get in on this too. Not sure what a clan with a HUMAN head would be like but I'll try anything once.", Sharon stated in an equally flirtatious tone.Camilla clenches her fist trying to contain her annoyance. Ein facepalms thinking 'this was a mistake.'"Ok, I'm done.", Scarlett stated raising up from the table, "You guys are just...Ugh!", she says before stomping off to the restrooms. The rest silently watch her leave.Camilla raise up, "I will go speak with her.""I'll go too. Theres still quite a few patrons besides us here. We do not want another incident like-", Ein gestures to the people on the other side of the food court."There won't be!", Camilla interject then turn to Caleb, "Señor I will return shortly."Ein decides to trust her instincts and watch the restroom location for anyone else that may enter."Yeah. Meanwhile, I have get a few things straight over here.", Caleb spoke in serious tone like a dad at Disneyland tired if his children's shit making the other Devils recoil nervously."Please do.", Camilla utters softly then leaves as the others refocus on Caleb, "Alright, where the fuck to begin?"...in the women restroom...Scarlett stared intently into the mirror her hands on the counter and one of the sinks running for white noise. She inhaled and exhaled to calm herself like her therapist said. Suddenly, she hears someone enter and already guessed who it was. Camilla walks into view; she guessed right."Right on time. Come to give me a big sister talk about 'why he's different?' or 'I shouldn't close myself off like that'?", Scarlett mocks not even bothering to turn around; only look a Camilla reflection."No, I came to give a typical woman-to-woman talk about why ju are choosing to throw away your progress.", Camilla replied leaning her back against the sink counter, "What is wrong miha?""I'm fine. What wrong with you?! You and the others acting all cutesy and loving toward that human man. All because you think he's your Destined One? Come on, you know that's load of bullshit. A stupid dream we believe in to keep ourselves going when we're at our lowest.", Scarlett rebuffs.Camilla crosses her arms, "I do not THINK, I know. And Jes, I did not believe it was true either. Until I felt it, deep inside, it is unlike anything I had ever experienced.", Camilla replies as Scarlett rolls her eyes."Oh please, everyone believe they feel a connection to someone. Hah shit, I felt it with Blake. I felt it probably the same way you do. I gave him everything I had, body, heart, and soul, and HOW did he repay me?! With an enslavement collar and selling me like property. Everything is HIS fault.", Scarlett stated her body become engulfed in shimmering red aura, "Then there's Hana and rest fawning on being part of his harem as if having a human male is any better than a male Devil. Men are assholes no matter what species! He says he doesn't want anything from us NOW but just wait, he'll throw his hero act in our faces sooner or later! I refuse to be indebted to him nor matter what he's done!"She then feels Camilla lay a hand on her shoulder. Their eyes met and Scarlett sees the stern but caring look Camilla gave her."Listen miha, I understand ju completely. Ju have every right feel the way ju feel. However, after living with Señor the past month, I can say ju and the rest have nothing to fear. He is not like the men we have seen before. He IS a bit strange and hard to read at times. Sometimes I do not believe he is truly human at all but I also feel it is not right to lump him in with the other vulgar swine out there. I know it is hard trusting anyone like him but think about it. Can ju honestly say he is anything like the rest, like Blake?", Camilla gently squeezes her shoulder.Scarlett looks away; the scowl on her face softening and aura dying down when she thought about the night at the hotel. The way he looked at them without a hint of lechery or disgust. The way he talked to them as if they just regular people. Her aura dissipates completely before crossing her arms."Can ju honestly say ju sensed a single lie that escaped his lips? Can ju say he would use his debt as a reason to extort ju?", Camilla inquiresScarlett remains silent but then slowly shakes her head 'noCamilla brushes her hair fixing it up a bit, "It is ok. Give Señor a chance Scarlett, he will not hurt ju. Even on the off chance he does, ju know I will beat his culo (ass)"Scarlett snorts a laugh, "Hehehe, yeah, you would. Alright I...guess I could give him ONE chance. But that's it.""That is more than enough. Come let's get out of here, it smells odd.""Ugh, I wonder how many of our friends he's added to his little harem.", Scarlett says"Um, huhu, mi guess...zero.", Camilla says earning a surprised look from Scarlett, "Come, ju will see."The two of them leave the bathroom much to Ein's delight who was glad not to stress over toilet patrons anymore. As they approach the table, Scarlett was surprised seeing Caleb standing up finishing a mini tirade as the other sat listening like children that were fiercely reprimanded. Even Even the Zyklons were impressed how he asserted himself. However, it was clear their harem passes had been revoked."Now is there ANY part of this any of y'all don't understand?", Caleb stated with the firmness of Judge Judy."N-No sir.", Jocelyn spoke softly as the rest agreed."Dulca caótica, what did ju do Señor?", Camilla inquired."He gave us a verbal spanking that's what?", Sylvia says raising her head up."I seriously think you missed your true calling as a tv judge.", Drei commented."I'm camera shy.", Caleb replied as Camilla sighs in relief. Relief that she wouldn't have to give some of the girls HER version of a spanking. Caleb then turns to Scarlett, "Anyway, are you doing ok."Scarlett gives him an inquisitive look, "I'm fine. Don't worry about it.""Good, look just...ignore all of that whole harem stuff ok? We're just a group of friends just hanging out together(even though this WAS just supposed to be a date). In fact, let's just start over. Nice seeing you again Scarlett...I don't even know your last name.", Caleb says extending a handshake to her.Scarlett raises an eyebrow realizes Camilla wasn't joking when she mentioned how weird he was. She shrug extending, "I don't have one. It's a monony-", she stopsThe second their hands touch Scarlett heart palpitate and her entire body pulsated with an unknown energy as time itself seemed to screech to a hault. Her eyes met Caleb's and, for a moment very brief moment, she felt...whole. Suddenly, Caleb releases the handshake."Heh, cool, kinda like SinBad", Caleb said snapping her to attention."U-um, y-yeah if you say so.", she utters avoiding eye contact and hiding her blush before quickly going to her seat and proceeding to eat the rest of her food. The other Devil girls see the display and were speechless. They never met a guy exhibit such a commanding yet caring demeanor at such a fairly young age. Caleb and Camilla set together and proceed to finish their meals."Damn, I'm actually getting really turned on over here.", Sharon whispered to Jocelyn."It's Niagra freakin falls in my tights right now.", Jocelyn whispers back shifting her legs togetherAs Caleb eats his curly fries, a thought occurs to him and decides to check his phone, "Oh dang! The musical starts in 20 minutes. Let's finish up so we can get some good seats.""Yes Daddy.", Jocelyn and Sharon spoke simultaneously without thinking and immediately blush deeply in embarassment as every one looks to them. Camilla eye twitches in annoyance.Caleb pauses a second, "Kayyy, I don't like that.""You will soon.", Drei commented"Shut up."WRSup Fam? Happy 4th! I sorta made it on time this time. I meant to post this early last week but mom's doctor appointments been keeping me busy. Unfortunately, it turns out she does, in fact, have cancer. My siblings and I are doing all we can at the moment and we have another appointment coming up to determine treatments. We're hold out hope. I mean shit, SHE hasn't given up and is still as optimistic and still smiling. So imma keep smiling for her.I hope you all enjoyed this chapter it was pretty fun to write.

    Chapter Text
    After finishing their lunch, Caleb and the group quickly made their way to the area where the mermaids and other aquatic liminals were performing. A large open circular tank with a huge mound of sand and watery depths surrounding the perimeter. There was a relatively large crowd of people but they managed to find decent enough seats near the upper-middle of the bleachers. They, specifically Caleb, recieved looks from other audience members ranging from curious to plain nasty seeing him with a group of Devils. Ein and Drei took their position with the latter surveying the surrounding crowd. Camilla took her place next to Caleb which immediately sparked a minidebate over who would take the spot next to him; embarrassing Caleb and testing Camilla's patience. Fortunately, Drei suggested it'd be best that Ein sit next to Caleb to guard him more effectively and quell their petty squabble. Then again, her making Caleb let Hana sit in his lap for a 'better view for a fellow shorty' felt more like a troll move only served to annoy the other Devil girls, especially Camilla, and make Caleb more nervous. At least Hana was happy.The actual show was a spectacle to behold. It was essentially an aquatic liminal rendition of the broadway play 'Chicago'. As such, it wasn't open for children to view for...obvious reasons. The sets were quickly sculpted and deconstructed from sand by the Crab liminals during performance which was obscured by a generated cloud of bubble foam curtains. The lead, a blonde mermaid with bright yellow scales, and the other mermaids delivered every song with knockout vocals that enchanted everyone in the crowd. There was a Scylla that performed a lovely rendition of "When you're good to momma". However, performance that killed it in every possible way was the Shark girls and their rendition of 'Cell Block Tango' '. Every emotional inflection, provocative movement, and the vicious demeanor of the girls perfectly brought out the songs atmosphere of danger and seduction. Camilla, the devil girls, even Ein couldn't help getting pumped and try singing along. Though Caleb was quite happy to see the girls enjoying themselves, he would sometimes catch Scarlett staring inquisitively at him before quickly averting her gaze when he glanced her way. She must still be suspicious of him.After the performance ended, they realized they needed to kill a little extra time before Hana and the rest had to board the bus back to I.A. facilities. Luckily, it just so happened that during the performance several...fish-headed people in black tuxedos (seriously, wtf Okoyado?) had been busy setting up souvenir and snack stands to gain revenue for their first performance debut. There were foods from mermaid and crab person (Yes, I know they're called Cancer) cultures and a ring toss game with small animal prizes like fish, turtles, and hermit crabs raised by merfolk. There were also trinkets like beautifully crafted glass vases and sea stone figurines."HA!", Hana exclaims tossing the last metallic ring on the bottle, "I did it!", she hops in place joyously."Wundervah!", "ALright Hana!", Heidi and Sylvia praised as the Blue devil blushes bashfully at their praise of her skill."Here you are little girl. Take care of this little one", said the Crab lady presenting a small tank with little turtle with blue markings on its head. Hana eagerly accepts."I will name him 'Rohan' and he shall be mine and he shall be my Rohan.", Hana spoke lovingly tapping the turtles shell creating a blue magic seal and having it recede into nothing along with the tank in her skirt pocket.Across from them at another stand operated by a Mermaid with platinum colored scales, Camilla, Scarlett, and the other Devil girls were admiring the colored glass jars, cups, vases and small figurines of different aquatic liminals."Wow, these are so pretty!", Julia spoke with twinkling eyes holding a clear magenta stained vase. It's like they're made our of rainbow light.""Huhu, not quite but close. They're refined from sea stones and hand polished by yours truly and her fellow glass workers. As you can see, we take our work very seriously.", the mermaid spoke proudly flaunting a figurine of herself."That's pretty obvious. I would feel like a sea princess wearing this.", Sharon says admiring the pearl necklace and other sea stone jewelry."I always thought of you more of a handmaiden.", Jocelyn playfully taunts."Then I'll be the most elegant handmaiden in all the land!", Sharon spoke in a mock renaissance tone putting on a sea stone tiara, "Let all basic, skinny bitches look upon my thighs and weep with envy!", she emphasizes posing showing off her luscious curves."Oh I'm weeping, just not with envy.", Jocelyn spoke before chuckling heartily then being joined by Camilla and the rest. Well, except for Scarlett, who was in deep thought. She couldn't stop thinking about what happened at the food court. The second she touched his hand...it as if something called out from deep inside her. What was that?"Alright, I'm back!" Came the voice of Caleb snapping Scarlett from her thoughts. Camilla and the others turn to see Caleb carrying a bag full of snack containers as Ein stood beside him keeping a close eye on any suspicious personnel before stepping away from the group, "Thought you guys might like some post performance treats.""Oh, gracias Señor.", Camilla spoke beaming an appreciative grin as the other devils turned to him with a smile. Scarlett purposely averts her eyes. Jocelyn and the others walk up ."Thanks hun!", Jocelyn stated taking her tray followed by Sharon, Julia. They open them to see a varied assortment of sweet confectionery designed after sea creatures like starfish and clams."Eeeeeee so cute!", Sharon squeals happily before taking the little wooden scewer and popping the little cheesecake clam in her mouth the squealing louder, "Oooh, shoooo good."Caleb stops at Camilla, "For you milady I have what the nice lady over there says is the girlfriend pack.", Caleb says pointing to the at stand operated by a Selkie before handing her a container decorated with coral pink hearts."Awww, I am special.", Camilla croons accepting his gift as Jocelyn and Sharon look on feeling a bit jealous. Scarlett scoffs turning her attention elsewhere before Caleb approaches her."Heya, would you like one too?", Caleb says offering a container to red haired Devil.She grumbles refusing to look at him."No no it's cool. It's organically produced. No animal products. I know you're vegetarian right? It's a little more expensive than the rest but...eh...making healthy choices usually is.:, Caleb says Scarlett gives him look surprised he remembered such a small detail about her from so long ago and went through such effort because of it. She reluctantly reaches out and takes it."Fine, since you clearly don't want me to say no, thanks.", Scarlett replies. As she takes it, she accidentally brushes her fingers against Caleb's fingers. The feeling from earlier returns and she pauses as her body pulsates and her heart begins to flutter before turning to him locking her sharp red eye with his chocolate brown."Oh, s-sorry about that.", Caleb apologizes taking a step back from her much to her surprise and slight disappointment.Scarlett turns away hiding her blush, "W-Whatever just be more careful! Idiot.", she stated before walking away from him.'Yeah she definitely still doesn't like me.', Caleb thought running his neck."Hi everyone!", Hana called out to them rejoining to group along with Heidi and Sylvia."Oh hey! I have something for you guys as well.", Caleb says before going to hand them eat a container. Scarlett watches him while standing away from the group as he interacted with Hana and the rest."Ahh, niche ghut (so good), it is like eating a fluffy cloud made of an Angels anguish tears.", Heidi spoke happily enjoying the treat."Oookay, whatever floats your boat.", Caleb replied"Thank you, Caleb-kun. Hehe, this reminds me when you did the same thing for us at the hotel.", Hana reminisces taking a bite of the mini cheesecake seahorses humming blissfully."Hey yeah! ~Guess it's just in his nature to treat girls to nice meals.~", Sharon spoke suggestively winking at him. Camilla glances at her from the side."I...don't know about that. Just doing what I think is fair.", Caleb answered with a shrug."Well, just we deeply appreciate you Caleb-kun. You're a very nice person.", Hana spoke looking up with sparkling, adoring eyes and a dark blue blush. The other Devil girl voice their agreement as Caleb sheepishly tries to telling it's not a big deal. Camilla softly grins at Hana. Suddenly, a thought occurs to Hana, "Oh! I haven't introduced you guys to Rohan yet!"Who's Rohan?", Caleb inquires as turns her attention curious as well. Hana taps a blue magic seal making her turtle and small tank appear in her hands."This is Rohan!", she stated presenting the turtle. Camilla recoils her face immediately turning pale."Gahh! Put that disgusting thing away! Mi demonio, ¿cómo puedes tocarlo?(How can you even touch it?)", Camilla shrieked. Hana gives a puzzled look as Caleb snorts a laugh followed by Sharon and the rest.Meanwhile, Ein continued to diligently observing every passerby that even came close to Caleb's group. She feels a gentle breeze caress her shoulder."See anything?", Ein inquires before Drei appears behind her in a flash."No weapons. Also I neutralized all possible security risks.", Drei says pointing to the people who currently in a fit over their phones being covered in a rubbery glue-like substance. Ein gives a skeptical look."Well, I guess either way, they shouldn't be taking photos of him without permission. I got things down here, continue watching from above.", Ein ordered."The best position right behind cowgirl.", Drei spoke before vanishing with a gentle breeze.Ein went back to sentry duty observing all the surrounding patrons."Hey Ein?", Caleb says getting her attention."Oh. What is it Mr. Bizzell? Is something wrong?", Ein inquires."No no, I just wanted to give you this.", Caleb says handing her a container. She at then to him tempted to take it but quickly averts her eyes."I-I appreciate it sir but...I need to focus on your safety. Besides, I...really shouldn't.", Ein replied in a slightly shameful tone."Dieting still?", Caleb inquires"Yes, and it's not going well.", Ein admits"Whaddaya mean? You look great to me. Besides, these are sugar-free and organic. All that good stuff. Go ahead.", Caleb says to making Ein blush slightly at the sudden compliment."Oh, um, well if you insist. Thank you sir.", Ein graciously accepted with a slight bow."No prob.", Caleb taking out the last container. Ein watches curiously as he places it on top of one one of the cylindrical concrete structures. She grins immediately understanding what he was doing. The second he turns and walks away he feels a gentle breeze blows behind him. He turns and sees the container was and Ein nods to him. He rejoins Camilla hoping Hana didn't freak her out too much with her new pet....The gang spent the rest of the time playing games at the stands and generally enjoying each others company. Camilla and Caleb had a little fun playing a couple merfolk games then sitting down feeding each other snacks from the container. Although Jocelyn and Sharon took any opportunity they could get to flirt with him forcing the Elder Devil to 'pacify' them. All in all, things were pretty chill.Also, during that time Scarlett would observe him and Camilla together. Barely a few hours ago she thought of him as no different than any other worthless man. But now, it's like as if something awakened inside her. Something making her see him in a different light. What?'Hahhh, what's wrong with me? Why am I feeling like this?', Scarlett sighs sitting alone at a bench watching her friends and Caleb enjoying the rest of their time before the I.A. bus arrives. She looks at her phone seeing it should be here in ten minutes then puta it away. She folds her arms leaning with back against the planks closing her eyes in deep thought. Oh well, the bus from"Hey.", came an unfamiliar voice she opens eyes and gives a dry look at the random tan guy standing in front of her wearing baggy jeans, a black tank, sunglasses, and a dumbass smile, "You lookin kinda lonely over here. Thought I'd come...keep sweethearts like you company.", he says plopping down beside her trying to look open and invitingScarlett scoffs dismissively, "I'm fine over here. Tell ya what, there's a pile of dogshit in street why don't you spew your crap to it?""Awww come on mama no need to be like that. I'm just tryin' to be friendly. You right though, you are fine over here like a bottle of red wine in the fall time.", He uttered huskily to her disgust.Scarlett then notices not too far from them four other guys looking in her direction pointing and snickering. She digs her claws into the wood making it crack."You know, I heard alot a news lately about liminals like you.", the guys persisted as Scarlett recoils feeling his arm snakes itself behind her. She sees him gazing lecherously at her body, "Why don't you and me get outta here, grab a drink or something and uh... make some news of our own?""GET AWAY FROM ME!", Scarlett shouted knocking him back then gets and storm away angrily."Whoa what the fuck?! Hey, Hey?! Look if you worried about the dough, I got ya babe", the man says taking out a small roll of money before Scarlett form a red magic seal around his burning his hand and setting the money on fire, "GAHH! FUCK! You fuckin' bitch!"Scarlett proceeds to storm off teeth clenched and fighting back her tears....Caleb and Camilla were surrounded by the other devil girls enjoying one last chat before the bus arrives while Ein stood close by. Saddened at the idea of not seeing Camilla again for an indefinite amount of time, Caleb decided to share his Zoom ID so she could stay connected with them. They were delighted, especially Hana who was more experienced with it than the others."Alright, so just message us whenever you guys get a chance.", Caleb says"Of course! I can't wait!", Hana stated cheerfully."Yeah, I'm still not that good with computer stuff. You sure we can't just have your number? Specifically, me?", Jocelyn spoke innocently."I'm sorry but that is too high a security.", Ein stated firmly."Welp, you heard the woman, that's a no.", Caleb replies, "Besides, you're not the only non-tech savvy person here. I'm still teaching this one how to use the internet.", Caleb teases gesturing to Camilla."Watch it Señor.", Camilla says shooting a warning glare at him.Suddenly, Heidi notices Scarlett approaching, "Oh, here comes Scarlett-fraudline-", she stops seeing her very expression, "Oh no, something is wrong."Caleb and the rest turn to see Scarlett approaches them looking very upset. Camilla walk up to her."Scarlett? Scarlett miha, what happened?!", Camilla says very concerned as she refused to look at her."It's nothing, I just want to leave.", Scarlett past her only to be stopped by Caleb."Sure doesn't seem like nothing! Come on tell us, we'll try to help you.", Caleb spoke assuringly."You get out of my way! JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!", Scarlett shouted at him angrily. Caleb notices the hurt in her face and the tears she was holding back."HEY!", came an angry man's voice causing Scarlett to flinch suddenly. Caleb, Camilla, and Ein turn to see five men approaching them with one clenching his hand. Camilla started piecing together what happened, "You think you can get away with this?! You fuckin' SLUT! HUH!?"Upon hearing that word Jocelyn and Sylvia step up."The fuck you just call her prick?!", Jocelyn barked angrily flaring her wings a bit as the other Devil girls crowd beside each other doing the same to look more imposing.Ein steps between the two groups, "Stop! What is the meaning of this?!""Who the hell are you?!", stated another slightly muscular tan guy in polo shorts and blue tank top."I'm Agent Zyklon of ICEP'S MON division. Now, I ask again, WHAT is the meaning of this?!", Ein spoke demanding an answer."Well, Ms. Agent, that red haired demon over there attacked my boy for no reason!", stated a bald headed darker skin guy in camo pants pointing accusedly at Scarlett. Scarlett glares at him as Jocelyn and the rest moved to her side protectively."No reason my ass! He was bothering me when I was alone then tried to PAY me to have sex with him! So I burned his hand along with his allowance!", Scarlett shouted back"That's a lie and you owe every last cent back bitch!", the man shouted pointing his burned finger at her which led to the other Devils and the guys shouting back and forth. Pretty soon, other patrons and the shop owners stopped what they were doing to watch the scene."ENOUGH! ALL OF YOU!", Ein shouted stomping her foot creating a small shockwave that knocked everyone back slightly. She turns to Scarlett, "Ma'am, I cannot say your response is entirely without fault and will discuss more on that soon."She then turns to the man with a serious glare and steps up to him, "As for you, sir, if what she says is true, keep in mind the merfolk do have hidden camera around this entire area. If it turns out you did attempt to solicit sex in broad daylight, well, let's just say that incinerated pocket change will be the LEAST of your worries. Do you understand?"The man goes quiet swallowing hard with a frustrated look on his face. He says in a begrudging tone, "Yeah, I understand."Suddenly, the I.A. bus pulls up audibly coming to a screeching hault. Ein backs up with a stern but cocky look."Excellent.", Ein turns to Camilla and the rest approaching and leads them to the bus while whispering something to Scarlett. Camilla glared at the men before Caleb takes her squeezing a bit."It's alright. They're not worth it, let's just go back to the car.", Caleb whispered to her. She glances at them before following him. The men behind them notice and begin snickering."Hey yo! Devil in the jean skirt!", hooted the burly dark skin man, "After you done with him, how bout I show you what a real man looks like?!", He emphasizes grabbing his crotch. Camilla tenses trying to ignore them as Caleb tried keeping her calm"Maybe she got him under her spell. That Devil pussy good man?! You do her from behind or do them big ass wings get in way hahahahaha.", the polo shirt guys jeered as the other guys joined in laughing. Caleb clenched his teeth stifling his own irritation then noticing the agitated look on Camilla's face.Just ahead of them, Ein was talking to Scarlett with the Devil girls as a line of other liminal students boarded the bus. Scarlett appeared to scoff at Ein indignant to her explanation. Hana then turns to Camilla and Caleb."U-Uh, Ms. EIN?!", Hana called outEin, Scarlett, and the others looks to see the guys harassing Caleb and Camilla now. Ein notices look on Camilla's face realizing she's almost at her breaking point."Move aside, just get on the bus! All of you!", Ein stated pushing past them and the other liminal I.A students."Watch this.", says one of the guys lighting up a cigarette then flicking it into Camilla's hair. She shrieks before swiping it out of her hair. She pants angrily stopping on it glaring murderously at the men mocking her."Tirarme mierda? ¿Eh? ARREGLARÉ TODOS TUS POLLOS Y LOS ABANDONARÁ TUS GARGANTAS QUE ERES INOLVIDOS, RESPIRE CERDOS(Throw shit at ME? Huh?! I'll TEAR OFF ALL YOUR COCKS AND THEM DOWN YOUR THROATS YOU WORTHLESS, BREATH WASTING PIGS)!", Camilla screams at them as Caleb grabs her arm holding her back.She attempts to create a large black magic seal in her free hand pointing at them but Caleb steps in front of her throwing his arms up to block her." Move Señor!", she demanded."NO! Don't give them the satisfaction Camilla that's what they want! You'll just give'em grounds to say YOU attacked them!", Caleb reasoned."I do not care Señor! They deserve to die! ALL OF THEM!", Camilla stated."Oh, what was that? Come on, Señorita Satan say it again!", taunted one of the guys recording her on his phone. A couple other guys took out their phones too."Please listen Ms. Sartana! If you care about Mr. Bizzell then don't engage them.", Ein added as the other Devil came up to check on her as well each of them pleading for her to stop."Uh-Oh look at this getting more devils in on the action. Might have a orgy on our hands boys!", the man continues to taunts trying to rile them up. Caleb glares at him then turn back to Ein."Ein, just hurry get them to the bus! Camilla just go to the car I'm right behind you! GO to the CAR! Everything will be alright. I'm not going to leave you.", Caleb stated as Camilla began to calm down a bit. She looks at the men again then to Caleb seeing the assuring eyes she come to find sanctuary. She, along with Ein turn away from the men walking back to the bus while Caleb and Ein guided the from behind blocking them from them men."Look at this nigga here.", Said the dark skin guy ( so it's fine), "Act like he a Devil advocate or some shit.", he mocked as Caleb tried to ignore him turning away."Bruh yo mama must be real proud having a son who's the Devil's fuckboy!", the guy with the burned hand stated. Caleb stops in his tracks. Ein turns to him questioningly before flinching in shock seeing dark expression he was making along with a menacing purple glow in his eyes. He then turns around facing the men."Mr. Bizzell wait...", Ein stated as Camilla and the other devil girls turn to see what was happening."I'm sorry...I couldn't hear you. Say it again.", Caleb spoke in a low, threatening tone.The man smiled wickedly, "I said your mom-"*zoom* Caleb teleports in front of the man's face causing him to fall back on his butt dropping his phone. The other men back away in fear. Scarlett and the other devil girls look on in shock and astonishment."W-what the fu-", The man uttered before going silent seeing Caleb's menacing glowing purple eyes glaring down with killer intensity as a light purple aura enraptured Caleb's body. The other men look on uncertain of what he'll do."Apologize.", Caleb demanded to which the man remained speechless, "APOLOGIZE!""ALRIGHT! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! H-H-H-Hey you, uh, S-Scarlette? I'm sorry! Ok?", the man apologized profusely. Scarlett merely glares at him wordlessly.Caleb then looks to the other men expectantly as they throw their hands up."Bruh, I didn't mean NONE of that. She seem like a nice lady for real though.""We're sorry man. We were just playing around man. H-He's the one started this shit anyways.", the polo shirt guy stated pointing to the burned hand guy who gives a look like 'wtf man?!'."Leave now, and don't talk to or even LOOK at any of them.", Caleb spoke in an eerlly calm tone. The guys did as instructed quickly running leaving the premises and their 'friend' to fend for himself. Caleb looks down at man's burned hand, "Consider that as a reminder that 'No' means 'Fuck off' "As Caleb turned away facing a still stunned Ein, Camilla, and the other Devil girls, he didn't notice the man glaring at him then taking something out his switchblade."Look out Caleb-kun!", Hana stated breaking Ein out of her trance."Fuckin freak!", he yelled preparing to stab Caleb in the back. Ein rush to deflect it with he blade. At that second Caleb instinctively turned putting him arm back to defend himselfA surge of purple aura expands from his hand creating a glowing barrier that stuns the man and Ein before repelling them back ten feet with the guy landing hard on his groaning at the pain. Camilla, Scarlett and the other Devil girls are left speechless as Ein regains her bearings equally surprised.The purple aura fades from Caleb's body and his eyes return to normal. He then stumbles back feeling dizzy. Camilla catches him."Señor?!", She says in a concerned tone slinging his arm around her shoulder to support him."We gotcha.", Sharon spoke supporting his other side."Haaahhh, I'm fine you guys. I just...got a little dizzy that's all.", Caleb assured proving it by standing on his but shaking off a headache.Further away, the man tried getting to his feet to try making a run for only to be tripped up again as gentle breeze blew around him. His legs and arms were quickly bound together by rainbow colored ropes."Wha-What the fuck?", He utters before Drei appears then jams her folded up empty container in his mouth muffling his voice. She then takes out his phone deleting the video before slicing the phone in half with her scythes and tossing them at his head."WHAT WAS THAT?!", Jocelyn stated getting up close with sparkling eyes of admiration. The other Devil girls crowd him as well with expectant. Ein approaches from the side wanting an answer as well."I...I don't know! Honest! It's the first time that-well, the teleporting isn't THAT new but the glowing barrier just...happened.", Caleb stated."That was so cool! You were covered in a purple aura! A deep purple!", Hana stated enthusiastically. Caleb rub his neck slightly before looking to Scarlett then Camilla."A-Anyway, are you both alright?", Caleb inquires"I am fine, gracias Señor.", Camilla replies.Scarlett looks away, "Y-Yeah..."*HONK HONK HONK*The bus driver blows the horn impatiently signalling it was time to leave."Whoa! We have to go, the bus is about to leave!", Julia stated."Ohhhh, shit! You girls need go now! Hurry!", Caleb urged."But I still have more questions!", Hana stated."We'll talk tomorrow on Zoom! Now go!", Caleb replies to which she nods accepting before rushing to board the bus with the others."Well what about THAT asshole?!", Scarlett pointed in his location before noticing he was gone, "Wait, where did-?!""Don't worry, we'll take care of him.", Drei says getting her attention dragging the struggling man by his bound legs like a ragdoll."Sis, what are doing with him?", Ein inquires."Taking him back to his friends.", Drei replies rounding the corner.Ein and Scarlett then notice the other Devil girls along with the other passengers on bus pointing and laughing with their windows down and some of them with their phones out. Ein, Scarlett, Caleb and Camilla walk around the corner surprised to see the other men all stuck together hand to leg to butt like a piece of living modern art. They were each gagged muffling different crap. All their phones were broken and their pants were down.Caleb and Camilla burst out into laughter as well with Scarlett lightly chuckling as well."Sis, what is this?!", Ein inquires incredulously."I call it...'Life of the Douche'!", Drei stated in a grandiose tone before Ein groans facepalming."Hahhh oh, Scarlett, hurry or ju will miss your bus!", Camilla informs as Scarlett realizes the bus was still waiting."R-Right!", Scarlett turns to run before looking back at her then to Caleb, "Um...thanks for...you know.", she says in a less agitated tone with a slight rosy cheeks."It was nothing really. Hell, Drei got to do the fun part.", Caleb replies smiling at her."Please don't encourage her sir.", Ein pleads knocking a couple guys loose.Scarlett then boards the bus with the other Devil girls. Hana and the rest hang wave to goodbye as Caleb and Camilla waves back. As they pull off, Scarlett leans back in her seat the pulls out the container of snacks from her bag Caleb gave her earlier. She feels her heart flutter and body react the more she thought of him and, strangely, she was starting not to hate it. She knew she had to explore it further....Caleb and Camilla stayed behind to answer questions when police showed up to apprehend the men that were harassing them. Ein and Drei gave their statement as well along with the statements from patrons and shop owners who witness the events. The guy who harassed Scarlett was arrested and charged with attempted murder on Caleb. The other four men were released with stern warnings; after the adhesive wore off.When that was done, Camilla and Caleb decides to call it a day and go home with the Zyklons tailing them the entire way. On the way home, Camilla wanted to listen to more of Caleb's music to which he was happy to oblige. He decided to treat her to a little 'Despacito' which she seemed to instantly fall in love with.Eventually, they arrive home and pull into the driveway before proceeding to exit the car. Ein and Drei appear behind them. Caleb then notices the Monoeye agent lady's car still parked on the curb. He takes out his keys but before he could unlock it, the door suddenly flies."HEEYYYY! The prodigal son returns!", Zwei enthusiastically welcomed with open arms blocking the doorway."Uh, hey Zwei. Can ya move? I would like come inside now.", Caleb replied"Geez Boss buy a girl dinner first, HA! Got'em.", Zwei stated laughing out loud."Just move!", Ein demanded."Alright, alright.", Zwei spoke nonchalantly as Camilla, Caleb and her sisters make their way inside. Ein looks around suspiciously."Chief's back!", Lyca stated lunging at Caleb wrapping him in a hug which he instinctively catches so she doesn't knock him to the floor. Good thing his reflexes have adapted to Lyca's sudden display affection. Her tail wags excitedly as she nuzzles his chest before pushing off to look up with those soft amber eyes. Camilla takes a seat on the couch relaxing herself. Drei joins her picking up the tv remote."Welcome back! All of you!", Mirabelle stated exiting the kitchen cleaning a cup with a towel."It feels like you guys have been gone for days!", Lyca stated."It's been like...9 hours. Mayyyybe we should shout get you a clock besides the lunar cycles.", Caleb jokes pinching her cheeks.Lyca playfully pushes his hands away, "Come on, you know what I mean Chief."Caleb pets her head, "I hope you and Moon pie enjoy y'all selves today.""Yes, but this house always feels less like home when you're gone." , Mirabelle says in a whimsical tone."Wowww put THAT on a hallmark card.", Caleb teased making her giggle."Uhhh, Zwei? Where's Agent Monika?", Ein inquired slightly uneasy."Oh yeah, almost forgot about her! Thought SHE would let us in.", Caleb stated in realization as he and Ein narrow their eyes at Zwei."Oh, she's...around.", Zwei saysSuddenly, Agent Monika the Monoeye appears from the hallway. Caleb, Camilla, and Ein eyes widen in surprise seeing she was now wearing one of Caleb's aprons and nothing else. Her demeanor was that of a woman who had part of her spirit broken."Ok, 'Mistress' Zwei, your bath is-", the woman spoke in a defeated tone before noticing Caleb standing there with a dumbfounded expression. She face turns bright red in embarassment, "AHHH W-W-W-W-WHAT ARE DOING BACK SO-w-wait?! What time IS it anyway?! Uh, please listen sir I can expain!""Actually, YOUR not the one who needs to explain!", Ein stated gripping Zwei's head like a vicegrip."Owowowowow hey HEY come on! It's just a little hazing!", Zwei defended herself wincing from the pain, "Gah, come on sis it's good for building her character!""What KIND of 'character' are you trying to turn her into?!", Ein stated pointing at the woman's attire making the Monoeye cover herself even more wanting to vanish.Mirabelle teleports next to Caleb and whispers into his ear, "Yeahhh, Zwei was still upset after you left. I tried to comfort her so she'd ease off the poor girl. You don't want to know what her first outfit choice was.""Noted.", Caleb says then turning to the Monoeye, "Alright you! Change back to your work clothes! Your off the clock.""Ehh?! B-But what about-", Monika uttered."It's fine! I, or ANY of us, lookin at you Zwei, will tell anyone about this. You did a great job today. You can keep the apron as a bonus, wear it, burn it, I don't care.", Caleb stated as Zwei pouts crossing her arms.Monika's eye widens becoming watery as she smiles widely at him, "Oh thank you Mister!", she tries to lunge arms outstretched before Caleb blocks her by arm thrusting her face away at arms reach."No! None of that! Shame on you! Now go change and leave!", Caleb stated. The Monoeye apologize then walked backwards into the hallway to retrieve her clothes."Hmm, seems a new Thot Slayer has awakened.", Drei says touching her chin....After saying goodbye to Agent Monika, Caleb and the girls began relax in the living room talking about their day. Mirabelle and Lyca didn't really have much to talk about. Aside from watching a really interesting movie they found on Netflix that Zwei told them about called 'Monsters Inc' which they greatly enjoyed. Next, Caleb and Camilla told them about their date together along with showing them pictures Caleb took on his phone of all the marine life there; especially the one with Camilla playing with the otters. They talked about meeting Hana, Scarlett, and the rest of the Devil girls and mentioning how Camilla told them about the Multispousal marriage plan. Mirabelle and Lyca were shocked and worried but Camilla assured them her Amigas would not tell a single soul. They accepted deciding to trust the trust she has in them. Lastly, they talked about the guys who harassed them today along with Caleb intimidating them and unlocking a new ability to create barriers similar to Mirabelle's. Understandably, the girls, espescially Mirabelle were shocked by this revelation. Caleb tried replicating what he did but was unable to make the purple aura project the way it did. Eventually, they decided to leave it alone for now but Mirabelle pensively observed CalebA couple hours pass and, after a quick movie, it was time to turn in for the night. Mirabelle and Camilla decided to have a bath together and the Zyklons did their usual rounds before eventually deciding to turn in for the night as well."Yawwwn, good night everyone.", Lyca yawns sluggishly walking to her room."Night Lycs, night Boss.", Zwei says with a wave following Drei out the front door."See ya tomorrow.", Caleb says finishing straightening up the living room.Caleb maneuvers past the furniture brushing off any crumbs from the cushions."Mr. Bizzell?", Ein says getting his attention."Sup?", Caleb says turning to the wind weasel."Sir...I...I need to apologize.", Ein spoke candidly."For what?", Caleb raises an eyebrow."I failed to properly protect you. If I had been a better bodyguard things wouldn't have gotten out of control! I shouldn't have left you and Ms. Sartana alone to deal with those men. I was just barely able to stop Ms. Sartana from attacking them! And worst of all, you could have been killed by that man's knife had it not been for you awakening that new ability! You might as well have protected yourself and I simply got in the way! I'm so sorry! I'm a poor excuse for an agent!", Ein stated clenching her fists in frustration as she berated herself."Hey, come on now, I think you're overreacting. You did a great job today. I wasn't the only one who needed you ya know. Hana and the others were in just as much danger. Plus, Drei was there as well to pick up slack as well.", Caleb assured only for Ein to turn away."But that's the problem. It seems whenever that I'm the only of my sisters who done the least for you as a bodyguard! Drei was there with you when the Angel attacked. She protected you and healed you after we injured you during the full moon! She even helped you come to terms with your feeling for Ms. Sartana and Kessler! Even Zwei, as impetuous as she is, has done her job more effectively than I have. While I struggled against that Baphomet, Fantina, she was easily able to subdue her. Then there's I, who hasn't done anything substantial! I'm a failure!", Ein stated her entire body trembling as she struggled to hold back her tears. Suddenly, she feels a hand rest on top her head before seeing Caleb standing right in front of her with a serious look, "S-Sir?""Hey, what did I say earlier about the 'sir' stuff? Call me 'Caleb' ", he says proceeding to pet and stroke her soft, rounded ears making her sigh in comfort"Hahhh, Si-I mean, Caleb, what are you doing?", Ein inquires sheepishly as he massaged her ear to her reluctant delight."Calming you down so we can talk without you yammering about dumb stuff.", Caleb answered much to her confusion, "Now listen, you are NOT a failure! You are a wonderful agent. It doesn't matter what your sisters have done that you haven't and vice versa. You three have your own way of doing things that I've come to know so far. Each one of you has been incredibly helpful to me as more than just bodyguards. So don't sell yourself short like that when you've been a much bigger help than you realize.""B-But I...I could do so much more than-", Ein uttered before Caleb interrupts."You ALREADY do so much. You keeping me along with Moon pie and the rest safe, always being that vigilant eye against any possible threats, being one of the most effective planners and organizers I ever seen, and always shielding innocent people from harm. You are a wonderful person AND bodyguard Ein. You are anything BUT a failure!"Ein goes silent staring at him with a slight blush before a small grin crosses her cheeks, "T-Thank you. I needed that."Caleb smiles back patting her head, "Anytime. Also, keep up the great work and I'll keep trying to be someone worth guarding.""Of course you are si-Caleb! You're a very kind and patient person. It's no wonder your homestays, even the other Devil girls from earlier, adore you so much. A-Any girl would be lucky to be with you", Ein affirms blushing awkwardly at what she said."Heh, I'm glad you think so. I don't really see it.", Caleb admitted, "Anyway, it's getting late. You and your sisters get some rest now you hear? I'll see y'all tomorrow.""Of course!", Ein utters touching her fingers together thoughtfully, "One more thing, c-could you...perhaps do that again? You know...pat my head?""I...I don't see why not?", Caleb says before reaching up petting the top of her head. She grins contently as he massaged her ears and side of her head making her croon sweety. Her tail stands erect as she begins to make tiny delighted weasel sounds."Hahhhh, papa", Ein sighs before her eyes shot open in realization and Caleb gives a surprised look. She then pulls back blushing in heavily in embarassment, "I-I meant...Caleb...no that sounds worse! I mean, I didn't mean it like that! T-That just...it was-""It's fine! It's fine, Ein. Really, don't stress it too much. Things just...slip out.", Caleb replies diffusing the tension."I didn't mean that si'-Caleb. It just...I-I think...I better go. Have a good night!", Ein says turning out hiding het redeemed face. She closed the door begins her and Caleb arms the security system."Hahhh, Jesus Christ, how many girls with a daddy complex am I gonna come across in my life?", Caleb sighed before turning to head to his room. Unbeknownst to him, a set of tiny ears poked out from behind the chair. It was Drei, who had been quietly observing the whole scene."More than you think.", Drei quietly answered with a faint smirk before going over to the front door, entering the code, then quietly exiting making sure to rearm the system....As Caleb approaches his bedroom, he is then stopped by Camilla."Oh, Señor?"Caleb turns to her, "Hm? What's up?""I...I would...for tonight...I would like for us to sleep together in my room.", Camilla spoke before noticing Caleb's skeptical look and hastily corrects herself, "Oh, by "sleep" I don't mean that. I just want us to share the same bed tonight.""Uhhh...I don't know about this...", Caleb says in an uncertain tone as Camilla gives a worried look."It's ok Dear.", Mirabelle says getting his attention, "She came to me earlier and explained. I...I'm fine with it."Camilla gives her a thankful smile."Soooo, you guys just got together and decided that I would spend the night in another's bed without saying a word to me about how I feel?", Caleb says in a skeptical tone. Mirabelle and Camilla awkward looks of realization."O-oh? Well...when you put like that...", Mirabelle uttered softly."Sounds inconsiderate doesn't it?", Caleb finishes her sentence before noticing their shameful expressions, "Guys, look, I'm not mad or anything. I'd just like to be in the loop about what you girls want to do with me. Don't just decide for yourselves that I'm going to do something.""Does that mean my do not want to sleep together?", Camilla inquires."I...didn't say 'no' but...", Caleb stops seeing the longing expression on Camilla's face then looking to Mirabelle who nods forcing a supportive grin, "Sigh, alright, just for tonight Camilla."Camilla smiles widely, "Gracias! Gracias Señor!""Just...let me change into some pajamas.", Caleb says"Of course! ~I will be in mi habitacion(my room) getting ready as well~ ", Camilla gives a flirtatious wink happily swaying off to her room. When the door closes, Caleb turns to Mirabelle."You...sure you're ok with this?", Caleb inquires"Y-Yes Dear, of course. Listen, I'm fine with this, I know nothing will happen that you don't want. I want you two to bond as well.", Mirabelle confirms to him not wanting him to worry to much about her."Well, if you say so, I trust you.", Caleb accepts before cupping the side of her face, "I love you.", he spoke before gently planting a kiss on her lips to which she happily returns it."I love you too Dear.", Mirabelle spoke in a sweet tone."Sleep well...or, at least relax for awhile.", Caleb said knowing her species didn't require much sleep to begin with."I will.", She nods as he enters his room to change. She stands there for a moment trying to ignore the pang of doubt in the back of her mind before receding back into her room.Minutes later, Caleb emerges from his room in his black and red checker pattern pajama bottoms and plain red t-shirt and carrying a pillow. He approaches Camilla's door, takes a deep breath to mentally prepare himself, and knocks."Come in, Señor!", came Camilla's voice.Caleb opens to door seeing her room in it's usual neat state save for the nighttime atmosphere giving a more haunting but inviting atmosphere."~Over here Señor.~", Camilla spoke in a sultry tone. Caleb turns his attention to her canopy queen size bed with red silk curtains and immediately feels his heartrate increase seeing the black silhouette of Camilla curvaceous body as she lie in bed. She visibly beckons him with her finger, "~It's not polite to keep a woman waiting~"Caleb gulps feeling wiping his palms on his sides, "Y-Yeah...sorry."He walks over to the side of the bed where he could tell she was facing towards the door. He pulls the silk curtain aside. His eyes widen dumbstruck at the breathtaking sight of Camilla lying on her side wearing her pajamas consisting of red lace panties along with matching bra and silk stomach veil and black knee length socks. Caleb heartrate skyrockets and mouth goes dry as he's takes in ever little detail from her thick, juicy latina thighs, plump I-Cup breasts barely contained in their red prison to her bewitching, seductive red eyes and shiny, flowing brown hair. Her wings were draped limply around her back and her tail swayed about. Camilla's plump, full lips contort into her trademark devilish grin at his reaction."~Huhu, are ju going to join me or stand there all night?~", she teased.Caleb snaps out of his trance realizing what her was doing and blushes, "S-sorry. I'll just uhh...bed."He utters inciting a giggle out of her which only slightly put him at ease. He lies down on his back purposely keeping his eyes focused on the ceiling and a few inches of distance between them. Camilla notices and closes the distance. She then playfully traces Caleb's chest making him shudder slightly."Relax Señor.", Camilla spoke."That's easier said than done. This is all still new to me.", Caleb says still avoiding eye contact. He then feels her soft hand caress his cheek."Señor, look at me.", Camilla requests to which he reluctantly complies. Immediately, he feels his heart skip a few beats seeing her demonic but warm and loving upturned eyes couple with her incredibly adorable features, "Ju do not have to be nervous. I trust ju. I know the kind of man ju are and that makes me happy to share a bed together."Caleb eyes widen, "...Yeah, I'm not opposed to enjoying your company too."Camilla smiles happily at him.Suddenly, Camilla moves closer allowing her breasts to push into his arm as Caleb trembles again before feeling her head rest against his shoulder then drapes her arm across his chest. She adjusts herself as to not let her horns press uncomfortably into him. Caleb settles himself down giving himself a chance to admire how beautiful she was. He reaches up and gingerly pets her head even stroking her horns making her sigh happily"Hahhh Senor? I had so much fun today.", Camilla utters softly, "I'm *yawn* so happy I met ju.", she spoke becoming drowsy her eyelids becoming heavy."Me too Camilla. Me too.", Caleb whispers comfortingly."Buenas noches mi amor(Good night, my love)", she murmurs. A minute later could hear her softly snoring. Caleb couldn't help smiling thinking she couldn't get any cuter.Suddenly, he feels her tail instinctively slinks around his legs possessively. Caleb gulps feeling her soft thigh brush against his. She shifts slightly as Caleb notices her bra coming dangerously close to spilling out with every heave of her chest.'This is gonna be a long night.', Caleb thought tiredly......WRSup Fam! I'm still here! Sorry, if I've been gone for so long. I have been busy with work, getting ready for class this fall, and helping my mom. Well, things with mom aren't much better. The type of cancer she has is malignant and...treatment will only delay the inevitable. She was given one year like my father but he made to three without treatment and she's STILL in high spirits! I'm currently in the process of getting her a new place to live and I'm determined to work my hardest for her. Pray for me. Pray for her. And I'll do the same for all of you.Anyway, I decided to break this chapter into three parts. Part 3 will be out soon. If you have suggestions PM me and what not. Writing these storied is pretty cathartic for me now, especially in these times.That's about it. Remember to Fav, follow, and comment. As always, Peace Fam!
  
    Chapter Text
    Clothes Shopping 2: Electric Boogaloo****These events take place between Chapter 16 and 17 ****It was noon on a Friday Huntsville's Lane Plaza shopping district and Caleb and the girls were off on another little shopping trip. Since the full moon fiasco the other day, there had still been an air of awkwardness lingering in the air. Caleb decided a good way to fully restore order was to spoil them a little with the extra ICEP stipend money they got since adding Camilla to the house. The trolley pull up to sidewalk allowing Liminal and human passengers to disembark. Caleb steps off followed by Mirabelle, Lyca, and Camilla. The three liminals look around at the unfamiliar surroundings curious by all the different liminals and humans going in and out of stores. There were even liminals working in stores or running small stands selling wares. Caleb feels a light breeze and looks up to see the Zyklons hiding atop one of the shops signalling to him to which he discreetly signals back."What is this place Dear?", Mirabelle asks."Lane Plaza, it's another shopping center we have down here.", Caleb answers as the follow him."There are certainly many liminals around here.", Camilla comments cautiously looking around."Yeah, that's cuz ICEP been trying to get more liminals out in the workforce. Everyone needs somewhere to start.", Caleb answers."Oooh, something smells good! I think they're cooking meat over there! Can get some chief?!", Lyca stated pointing to the stand where a muscular Red Oni man was grilled Japanese dishes."Later sweety, promise. First we need to get some clothes shopping done.", Caleb says easing the disappointed She-wolf with head pats"Again, Señor, I am perfectly fine with the clothes I was given before moving in. I do not need any more than necessary.", Camilla says."I am also quite fine with the clothes I have now Dear.", Mirabelle adds."Sure, but I want to have some nice clothes. You espescially Camilla. I'd feel awful taking y'all stipends and not getting y'all nice things you want or need. Don't have to get much if you want just get what looks good to ya.", Caleb replies as Camilla blushes surprised he'd care enough to use his money anything she wanted."Ohh very well Dear.", Mirabelle relents knowing it was fruitless to change his mind, "If you are proper keen on having us indulge in your capitalist lifestyle then, how about letting me purchase more manga. I saw a small book stand further ahead I would certainly like to check out. Oooh maybe I can find a few sailor moon chapters.''"Heh, you sure don't miss a beat do ya?", Caleb replies smirking knowingly as she playfully stick out her tongue and giggles. They cross the street using the crosswalk and come upon their destination."Alright, here we are girls.", Caleb says stopping in front of a clothing store titled 'Weaves tale" with mannakins of human and various liminal body in the display windows dresses casual clothing ranging from skinny jeans to polo shirts. The girls stare curiously before Caleb politely holds the door open for them.They step inside and are instantly greeted by a wide assortment of liminal beautifully crafted liminal clothing ranging designer dresses, shirts, and pants to casual jackets and shirts for liminals with sections mostly tailoring to women but there were clothes for men as well. Changing rooms were in the fare corner next to the display of gorgeously crafted silk dresses.y They were several liminal women shopping and trying on outfits; some with hosts others with day passes. Camilla looks around in amazement having not seen so many nice clothes in one place."Oh, what have we here? New faces?", came a feminine voice. Caleb and the girls look up surprised to see Arachne women descend by a single thread from the ceiling. She had long black legs, black armor clawed carapace hands, her abdomen featured a red star shape black carapace, and her six eyes with bright crimson red. She wore a black and red nylon zip-up jacket that was kept partly open for her I-Cup breasts to be on display. She stares at them with an almost predatory smirk as Camilla gives her a skeptical glare, "Welcome to my shop, my name is Mabeline. ~You may call me May for short~ How may I be of service?""We were just...I mean, THEY were just looking for some clothes and stuff.", Caleb says gesturing between the girls trying not to appear nervous."Ah, then you've certainly come to the right place. My shop offers some of our best work in Arachne silk woven clothing.", May emphasizes spinning some thread from her clawtips."Oh my. You run this whole store on your own. Must be quite the daunting task.", Mirabelle says"Perhaps. Luckily for me, I have a few extra hands on deck. *clap clap* Lovelies!", May claps her hands. Immediately, 4 other Arachne women of slightly smaller size but same black armored bodies and red stars on each of their abdomen from two to five stars."Yes Madame.", the Arachne girls spoke simultaneously in an obedient tone."Wow, that's convenient.", Caleb spoke in intrigue. He fails to notice the two star Arachne girl staring at him curiously."Right? Anyway, anything you need just say so. We have a multitude of fabulous outfits sure to please anyone of any species, lifestyle, or beliefs. If you have anything specific you want, you may also browser out catalog for specially crafted clothing you can place order for.", She says presenting a catalog with multiple outfits and liminals posing. Mirabelle, Lyca, and Camilla eyes sparkled as she flipped through some of the pages."Whoaaaa, I like this place Chief! It's way better than that other clothing place we went to.", Lyca stated.May gives a skeptical look, "Oh? I'm guessing they didn't have what you all were looking for?""Nope! No they suuuurre didn't! We over here now so let's LEAVE it at that!", Caleb stated not wanting to reopen that can of worms. May and the other Arachne give a confused look. Mirabelle and Lyca avert their eyes knowing EXACTLY what he meant.Camilla lightly nudged Mirabelle and whispers, "Did...something happen?""It's not a pretty story.", Mirabelle whispered back. Camilla decided not to press further."Alright then, so you ladies follow April and June, they will get you squared away.", May says as the three and four star Arachne girls proceed to guide Mirabelle and the rest as Caleb wished them to 'have fun'. May then turns to Caleb, "What about you sir?""I think I'm check out what you got in y'alls comically small men's section. I assume that was on purpose by the way.", Caleb answers slyly"Huhuhu, could have been.", May replies with a smirk."Excuse me, do you have this in tiger stripes?", spoke a Blue Oni woman holding a red croptop."Yes, I have exactly what you're looking for.", May guides the woman as Two Star nudges Five Star."Hey Augusta, don't you think that human man looks familiar?", Two Star whispered gesturing to Caleb as he walked away."Yeah...I think I seen him before actually but-", Five Star(named Augustus) eyes widen in realization, "Gasp, wait, Julie, I remember now! You know that news story from a couple weeks ago? You know with those mafia guys and the devils getting rescued by a dark skin human?"Yeah...w-wait...you think?", Julie's eyes widen and Augusta smiles and nods assuredly. Suddenly, a Lamia woman with snakes for hair (Medusa) slither toward them"Excuse me, I'm looking for something to wear for my boyfriend's acceptance speech.""Oh, of course miss right this way.", they spoke simultaneously deciding to take care of her first....Meanwhile..."Oooh, this is cute.", Zwei smiles stand near a large circular rack of shirts admiring the lime green t-shirt with Zen Buddhist symbols then placing it in with small pile on her arm, "Hmm, let's see what else we got here."She then pauses sensing on oncoming threat. She leans to the side and skillfully blocks a chop to the head."HA! Not th-OWWW!", her triumphant was cut short feel a pair of fingers pinch and pull her ears. She turns to Ein who wore an annoyed scowl."What are you doing in here?! You're supposed to be surveying the outside perimeter for hostiles!", Ein stated."Well instead I decided to survey the INSIDE perimeter for hot styles. Ha!", Zwei cheekily replied."Zwei, this no time for shopping. There's no telling who may be observing Mr. Bizzell's movements. Besides, we have clothes at home.", Ein says to her."Come one, all we have are our clan's hanfu (Chinese dresses similar to Kamaitachi base MGE outfit) and ICEP uniforms. We're in the state's we need more variety. ", Zwei says before turning on her persuasion mode, "Besides, we could find some pretty good casual disguises here. You know, blend in with the crowd. Give the baddies a false sense of security, the BAM, nab'em like a mouse in a box."Ein wanted to rebuke but touches her chin in thought realizing she did have a point."*Pop* She's got a point you know.", spoke the voice of Drei as said wind weasel pops her head out from the clothes rack, "Plus, statistically, the closer we are to our enemy's target the harder it is to get to the target. And we could use some clothes. I'm not a sewing machine. I'm a weasel with a needle.""We just got our last pay transfer from our old branch was just converted to American money. It's plenty to splurge a little on new outfits! Get yourself some nice jeans. Make those thighs pop!", Zwei stated pointing to the racks with stylish jeans and shorts. Ein blushes in embarassment self-conciously touching her thighs together. She had to admit they looked rather nice."Well...ok, b-but make sure you each have a visual on Mr. Bizzell's location.", Ein says trying to maintain a serious tone."Understood.", Her sisters answers simultaneously."I'm gonna go do some scalping.", Drei says.Zwei raises an eyebrow, "Don't you mean 'scouting'?""No.", Drei answers before leaping inside clothes rack like some kind of short weasel Spiderman."Cool, imma check out what that 'Petite' section is all about. You should check out that section there.", Zwei smirks pointing up to Ein's left and walking off.Ein looks to wears she pointed and recoils with a deep blush seeing a pink and white that said 'Curved and Sexy' in Arial Black. She sees a few other liminal women with...well-endowed figures picking out different outfit combinations; even lingerie. Ein glances about unsure where to start them her eyes focus on a two-piece green shorts set with stripe pattern jacket and green shorts with white crop shirt underneath. She picks it up with an intrigued look and was surprised that it was for a pretty reasonable price. She then turns her attention to another lovely outfit....a good half-hour passes...Mirabelle and the girls managed to find several nice outfits with the help of the Arachne girls. They were now at the changing room."Ohhh, this a right proper fit. I wonder if it's too audacious.", Mirabelle says admiring the purple faux button V-neck ribbed long sleeve shirt with the top buttons unfastened giving an eyefull of double-D cleavage. Her lower horse half had only the upper half covered by a black tight fitting satin cloak leaving her leg fully exposed; a horse miniskirt. However, it also meant her both of her womanhoods were partly outlined much to her embarassment, "A-And I think this cloak a bit tight around the knickers. It's a bit tricky to move.", Mirabelle shyly spoke arm holding up her breasts and other hand shifting between front legs while the cloak hugged the curves of her rear."Hmm, we can get you a bigger size but, frankly, I think you absolutely gorgeous.", complimented April the four star Arachne girl.Mirabelle blushes a bit harder, "T-Thank you but I just don't-""Gah, maldita sea estas grandes alas!(Gah, damn these things!), cursed the voice of Camilla in the dressing room next to Mirabelle's. She stood in mirrors in her red multi-button top that accentuated her massive breasts and sexy midriff. The cause of her grievance being the pair of designer jeans she was struggling fasten. They just refused to budge past her thick latina butt."Is everything alright in-Oh.", Apriil opens the door eyed widen getting a full view of Elder Devil booty. She clears her throat, "Mayyybe we should try a something in your size?""This IS mi size. I err do not ERR understand the problema.", Camilla uttered trying to pull the defiant jeans up."Well perhaps...you've...outgrown it then?"The second April utters those word the entire room grows heavy with a menacing atmosphere as dread spread throughout he being. She flinches upon seeing the Elder Devil glaring at her with murderous intent and a crooked malevolent grin as if ready to drag her straight to the 9th circle of Hell."Oh? What do ju MEAN by that?", Camilla spoke in her demonic voice."Oh! I-I-I just meant you've outgrown that type of fabric. Clearly you need some more form fitting to compliment your fabulous body anyone would die for, hahahahaha. I know just the pairs you need (so please don't kill me.)", April waves her black carrapace hands forcing a smile.Camilla smiles back with the atmosphere returning to normal, "Excellenté. Kindly bring them here."April nods fervently prepared to leave before Mirabelle stops her."I-I could use this in a larger size, please.", She says gesturing to her cloak."Of course miss, right away!", April spoke before scuttling off."Huhuhuhuhu", Camilla giggles crossing her arms leaning on the doorway."What's so funny?", Mirabelle inquires poking out of her dressing room."Oh nothing Señora.", Camilla replies, "Ooh that top really brings out your eyes.""Thank you, s-so does...yours.", Mirabelle replies glancing at her cleavage trying not to notice the size difference."This is awesome!", Lyca stated bursting her door open getting Camilla and Mirabelle attention. Lyca wore a skin tight camo colored athletic bodysuit that accentuated her toned abs along with her firm thighs and butt, "It's like getting hugged all over but none of my moves are restricted at all!", She giggles happily striking different poses and flexing."I'm not surprised. That piece, and others like it, were synthesized from Arachne silk proteins and polyester blend to create a fabric for liminals like yourself with more active lifestyles. As you can see it's strong and incredibly flexible.", June the three star Arachne girl explained pushing up her regular glasses."Not sure what half that means but I'll say! It's almost like I'm wearing nothing at all.", Lyca twirls showing off her sexy back muscles and firm rear barely obscured by her black tail. Mirabelle and Camilla smirk snarkily at the She-wolf's enthusiasm before the latter slipped on a pair of biege yoga pants and admiring them."Oof! *crash* Xiǎo xiǎo de tā mā de lāliàn( 'Fucking tiny zipper' in Chinese)", came the sound of falling followed by the frustrated voice of Ein.Julie scuttled over and throws open the door to the fourth changing room next to Lyca's, "Miss, are you alright?!""Y-yes! The zipper just got stuck!", Ein assures as lay on her hands and knees butt in the air exposing her white panties and thick heart-shaped thighs and butt with her bushy tail dangling limply. The green shorts from earlier are caught around her legs and wearing the stripe pattern jacket and white top. Lyca peeks inside."Oh, hi Ein. You trying on clothes too?", Lyca statedImmediate realization hits Ein's and she turns her head and with a horrified expression seeing the door was wide open failing to utter a single coherent word. Her face becomes pale as a ghost upon seeing Camilla and Mirabelle(now back in her old cloak) peak around to see what was going one."*snort* pfffft Bhhahahaha! Ahahahahahaha! Diablos mia ahahahahaha...", Camilla laughs uncontrollably holding her sides as Ein blushes beet red in embarassment. Ein turns over trying regain her footing and end hopping keep her balance."Close the door, CLOSE THAT DAMN DOOR!", Ein stated mortified"Whoaaaa! What's going on over here?", came the voice of Zwei. They turn to see Zwei holding a medium pile of clothes and dressed in mint green tank top with the 'Zelda triforce symbol, a black choker, black belt spike collars on each wrist, and mint green form fitting Capri shorts. While casual, the outfit accentuated her C-cups and surprisingly plump butt. Zwei then notices the scene focusing on Ein. She immediately peices together what happened, sets her clothes pile down and walks in front of the doorway to salvage her sister's dignity. "Oookay, looks like I arrived in time. Alright, nothing to see here folks, just a thicc girl with thicc girl problems. This girl gets it.", she says waving them off gesturing to June who blushes. Ein faceplants to the floor groaning in despair."Ohhh, you look so cute Zwei!", Lyca stated.Zwei grins then strikes a couple poses, "Haha, really? Thanks, I wanted something to really bring out my swagger. You're looking pretty fine yourself Lycs. Tell ya the truth I-""Will you just help me already?!", Ein growled."Alright alright. Be back in a minute guys.", Zwei stated before closing the dressing room door, "Ok try wriggling thighs while I fool around the zipper.", spoke her voices from behind the door followed by the sound of rustling."You guys look great too Mira and Cami!", Lyca compliments her packmates."Hehe thank you very much Lyca. Black really suits you.", Mirabelle giggles ."Muchas gracias Señora.", Camilla replies."I'm back. Here we are ladies.", April spoke descending from the ceiling with a mini-stack of jeans and Centaur cloaks. Mirabelle and Camilla accept they're requested clothes and prepare to try them on."Oh! Let's see if Chief likes them too.", Lyca excitedly suggested.Mirabelle and Camilla pause a moment at her suggestion then letting the idea sink in."Ah, you must mean the man that was with you? Splendid idea, I'm sure he would love for you to model for him.", June enthusiastically stated winking suggestively."Heck yeah, let's do it! Let's model for Chief!", Lyca stated as Camilla and Mirabelle gave surprised looks wanting to protest but also becoming very intrigued by the idea."Fantastic!", April stated before Spider-Manning herself away via a strand of web from her abdomen. Camilla and Mirabelle tried to voice their opinion but she was already gone.They look to each other quizzically then to their respective small pile of clothes. Their imaginations started drumming up scenarios of what his reaction would be when he saw them in these clothes. What would he say? ...~What would he do?~ They both blush shaking the naughty thoughts away*BAM* Zwei kicks open the door dramatically."Someone call a Siberian warlord, the bombshell have fallen!", she stated. Lyca and the rest turn to see Zwei presenting Ein like a trophie. Ein stood fidgeting in embarassment now fully dressed in the outfit. Not only did the color scheme go well with her eyes, hair, and fur but the outfit perfectly highlighted her luscious curves and gymnast-like physique."Z-Zwei! Can you please? I already look ridiculous enough as is.", Ein says not liking the prospect of everyone seeing, or worse, pointing out her body fat."Wowww Ein, you look so pretty!", Lyca stated with starry eyes. Ein gives her a surprised look."Indeed, you look quite stunning Ms. Ein. It really brings out your eyes.", Mirabelle commented."Really?", Ein uttered hopefully, "I thought it might be a little...not my style.""Que? What IS your style then? A potato sack with a smiley face?", Camilla replied incredulously, " Ju have a nice a body. Do not be afraid to show it."Ein smiles happily, " Oh, well, thank you!", she chirps with a happy weasel squeak."Seeee? Three five star reviews in a row sis. Told ya you were being modest", Zwei stated assuredly patting Ein's back ."Hehe, I guess so.", Ein admits."Hey guys! We're gonna model for Chief! You guys should join in too!", Lyca stated as Camilla and Mirabelle shot her a confused glare.Ein and Zwei give her a questioning look blinking comically."Say what?", both weasels uttered simultaneously...Meanwhile, with Caleb...'Well, it's official. I have looked at every single shirt on this rack...twice.', Caleb thought to himself in a bored tone. He looks around at the four other guys that were occupying this small island of masculinity. Two of them occupied the ONLY two dressing rooms for the guys while one guy with hipster glasses and jeans sat on one of the stools on his phone. Next to him was a bald guy in red shirt watching with somber expression as his homestay shopped like there's no tomorrow. Caleb shakes his head blowing lethargically then looking around to see if he could find his girls. Unfortunately, this section of the store only offered a view of women's clothes and accessories and different liminal women scurrying about. He then walks over to the other guys and sits down next to baldy."Sup?", Caleb says noticing the man looking at him.Baldy sighs and speaks in a clear Southern accent, "Not much man. Not much at all."Caleb nods knowing this didn't feel like engaging at all and takes out his phone trying to distract himself by catching up on an update to a fanfic story he started a while back. Out the corner of his eye, he could swear the hipster was looking at him weird but decided to ignore it thinking he was imagining it."Excuse us?", came the voice of the Two Star Arachne(Julie). Caleb and the guys look in slight surprise seeing her and Five Star(Augustus) descend from the ceiling. Julie scuttles up to Caleb with an almost excited grin, "Um sir? Sorry to bother you and all but, aren't you the guy from that news story a couple weeks back? The 4th of July Distaster? You're Caleb Bizzell right?Caleb tenses up nervously. He then notices the two other guys turn to him with intrigue jaws dropping in realization."Uhh No. Nope. You got the wrong guy.", Caleb insists hoping they'll buy it."Don't be ridiculous! Of course you are. You're the guy who saved those Liminal girls from the mafia!", Augusta gushes admiringly at him."Gah, will you please lower you-", Caleb tries to rebut until Baldy stops."Holy shit, it is him.", the hipster guy says showing an article he saved from the internet."Well, I'll be goddamn! I thought ICEP took all them down.", He chuckled heartily, "So It is you! My wards and I saw you all over Facebook! You a hero man.""No I'm-! Listen, can you all please just-""What are you saying?! Of course you are. You know you really shook things up in the liminal community.", Augusta urges."She's right. Hearing your story made me decide to give ICEP a second chance. Now I work here and make wonderful accessories!", Julie stated emphatically giving Caleb suggestive smirk and a good view of cleavage."Hey, are you gonna be here awhile? I need to go get my wards they are gonna love this!", Baldy stated before going to get his wards."No! Don't go get-", Caleb stated before Augusta gets up in his face."I heard there were Hellhounds too! A whole pack! How did you survive?!", Augusta inquired with all 8 eyes locked on him, "They said one dragged you off into the woods! Is that true?""I...", Caleb pauses at the memory of being dragged like a ragdoll through twigs and foliage. His heart starts to race and a nervous sweat begins to build, "I-I don't-""Ah, dude hang imma go get my homestay so we can get a picture with you.", the hipster guys says getting up."Oh! How did you escape the warehouse with those Devils? Weren't you scared?", Julie inquires."Pretty much!", Caleb stated as his anxiety slowly increased as more Liminals who were passing by stopped to see what was happening to which Augusta "kindly" tells them adding to Caleb's stress, "Can we PLEASE stop now? I just want-"Before he could finish, he's surrounded by more liminal girl; two Lamia, a Minotaur, a Harpy, a Kobold, even a Wyvern began bombarding him with dozens of questions. Every second triggering a painful memory of that day. He notices Baldy return with his wards(two Tetra arms and a Mosquito) and piling on more stress. He then feels someone tug against his pants and looks down to see a dwarf girl."Hey...did...did you really take a bullet in the heart for a Devil?", she inquires.A surge of fear rips through his being as one sound enters his mind. BangCaleb shoots up from his seat, "OK! THAT'S IT! Let me though! LET ME THROUGH!", he demanded pushing through the small crowd. Julie, Augusta and the others give him a surprised looks."I-Is everything alright sir?", Augusta says worried she did something wrong."Yes yes! Just...haghhh!", Caleb groans wiping his face and trying to take deep breaths. Suddenly, June drops down scaring the crap out of him, "Gah! Jeezus christ!""Oh, sorry Sir! Are you alright?", She says apologetically."Hahhh yeah...in a cosmic sorta way.", Caleb answers sarcastically."Excellent! I just had to find you. Your homestays are need of some assistance. That is...if you're not to busy over here?", June says looking to the small crowd of liminals and their host then lingering on Julie and Augusta."Nope! Not at all!", Caleb turns to the group, "Sorry y'all I am needed somewhere else. Goodbye. Let's go.", Caleb says walking off as June quickly catches up to show him where to go and leaving the slightly disappointed crowd behind. Augusta and Julie glance at each other feeling rather ashamed."Ummm ok everyone, nothing to see. Return to your shopping.", Augusta urged dispersing the crowd.'Hahhh hopefully I can make it outta here without having a fuckin seizure.', Caleb thought following the spider lady....Meanwhile, with Drei...Drei stood admiring the Arachne silk-vinyl business suit she found in the 'Super-Petite' liminals section at a good bargain along with a pile of clothes. Mostly short pants and petite shirts with classic rock designs like Nirvana and Jimi Hendrix."Yes. This pleases me.", she spoke stepping out of the dressing room."Aww so you cute. You got a little suit. Guess that makes you a business woman", Says a red Oni woman looking down with a wide grin at Drei."Thanks, nice Hooters shirt. Guess that makes you someone's disappointment.", Drei commented as the Oni gasps with a scowl, "I assume your mad but all I can see looking up is two red bean bag sized meat sacks."The Red Oni recoils immediately covering her underboobs then dashing to a nearby dressing room while cursing something at Drei. The little weasel didn't care in the slightest admiring her suit before turning her attention to the direction she left Caleb. She had observed him in the Men's Playpen(as she called it) for awhile and saw he was quite content looking around the clothes and decided to do a little quick shopping for herself. She should really get to him.'Eh, I'm sure he's fine. How much could he get into in 10 minutes?', Drei though with a shrug then posing and doing a 'Boss ass bitch' walk. Oh yeah, she's getting this....back to Caleb..."I'm gonna have a fuckin seizure.", Caleb muttered softly."Get a load of this one Chief!", Lyca stated bursting from her dressing room wear dark blue hot pants that showed off her firm butt and thighs with a tight tank top with a cartoon wolf head on it. Lyca twirls and poses for him."Don't forget about me!", came Zwei who comes up from behind dressing in a camo skin tight bodysuit that hugged her curvy, slender form and accentuated her firm apple butt and perky C-cups. She strikes a few sexy poses with pouty lips as Lyca mimics her, "Whaddya think Boss? Too much or juuust enough?"Caleb blushes a little averting his eyes, "Y-You both look great, okay? Why do you need my opinion anyway?""Aww, come on Boss, you're their host. Your word means more than any rando on street. Don't bd shy. You know a girl's sex appeal is paramount to her self-esteem.", Zwei spoke flashing a naughty smirk, "I mean you couuuld go back to the men's section-""Nope! Nonononono! I am fine here.", Caleb cuts her off."Great! Come on Lycs, give him more incentive.", Zwei urged.Lyca turn around and flexes giving Caleb a good look at her strong, firm sexy back, thighs, and toned legs. Caleb heart skips a beat as he stared at her. Zwei laughs at his reaction."Hahahaha, I guess Boss likes THAT outfit Lyca. It's a keeper!", Zwei chuckled as Lyca smiles happily and Caleb glares daggers at her."Hahh, sister, please stop tormenting Mr. Bizzell. Why are we even doing this?", Ein scold cracking the door to her dressing room open."Why not? Thought it would be fun. Besides, you can't deny getting a guy's opinion couldn't hurt." , Zwei debated, "Come on, show the Boss your inner sassiness."Ein wants to retort but couldn't deny her curiosity."Sigh, just come on out and get it over with.", Caleb says as Ein blushes in embarassment."Y-Yes, Mr. Bizzell.", Ein replied before stepping out. She was now dressed in a beige colored eith emerald green leaf patterned sundress that flowed gracefully and accentuating her cream-colored skin, green fur, and curvaceous figure. The hem had opening allowing her sexy thighs and legs to be on display and accentuated her plump butt and allowed her bushy green tail to hang freely. The v-shaped opening allowed a good view of her bountiful creamy G-cup breasts. Caleb found himself staring way longer than he intended which Ein noticed. Ein blushes looking away, "P-Please don't stare at me like that sir."Caleb blushes, "Uh, s-sorry...you...look beautiful! That dress really suits you Ein."Ein blushes with a small grin instinctively hugging her hips together, "Oh, uh, why t-thank you sir."Dawww, it's like a scene from one those lame senior prom movies.", Zwei chortled"Shut up!", Caleb and Ein stated simultaneously before Ein chucks a neatly folded stack of jeans at her face. Zwei groan on the floor as Lyca stood over her puzzled. Caleb sighs as Ein flashes a smile at him then closes her door to try another outfit."Señor? I am ready.", Came the slightly muffled voice of Camilla from in her dressing room."M-Me as well, Dear.", added the voice of Mirabelle.Caleb inhales mentally preparing himself, "Alright."He moves over to sit in front of their dressing rooms."Okay!", Caleb alerts them."~Here I am Señor~", Camilla as her door swings open on its own with a little magic seal on it. Camilla steps out wearing a black long-sleeve floral lace blouse that exposed her sexy midriff and bellybutton and allowed her massive I-Cups to be more pronounced and attention catching. She wore a dark red skirt with a single opening for her left thigh that accentuated her luscious thighs and wide hips and made her plump butt pop out. As black slender tail sways alluringly, she leans against the door seductively crossing her leg, which revealed she had on black stockings, smirking at Caleb, "What do ju think Señor?"Caleb mouth is agape feeling a 🎵shot to the heart🎵 that took his breath away the more he drank her in. Lyca stared with starry eyes. His mind raced as lots of naughty thoughts tried their dambdest to push past his barrier of self-restraint. He clears his throat."I-I-I you look...*slap* *inhale*...You look amazing Camilla. Really, really amazing; just...drop dead on your head in a Temperpedic bed gorgeous!", Caleb stated after slapping the stupid out his mouth then beaming a nervous grin. Camilla smirks devilishly at him amused at his reaction."Yeah, you look awesome Cami!", Lyca stated.Camilla chuckles in satisfaction, "Hohoho, Gracias Señora and especially ju Señor. ~What do ju like about it in particular Señor?~", Camilla spoke hand on her hip, wings unfolded, posing seductively with a wink.Caleb tenses his heart racing a bit, "Ahaha, well...several...things honestly hehehh. You have...great uhh...physique? And you really bring this air of sassiness that any guy would find charming really.", Caleb rambled his imagination working it's tricks. Mirabelle listened from the crack becoming a bit uneasy.Camilla touches a finger to her chin, "Hmmm, that is a bit vague Señor. ~Perhap ju should take a closer look~", she spoke gesturing with her finger for him to come closer to which Caleb swallow nervously"A-Are you ready Dear?!", Mirabella stated cracking open the door interrupting the scene." Y-Yeah! Yeah! Come on out Moon pie! Let's see!", Caleb encouraged happy at the interruption as Camilla softly grumbles.Mirabelle door open as the Centaur steps out wearing a purple and white long sleeve silk keyhole shirt with in the design of a cute pony. It hugged her curvaceous waist snuggly and the top opening had little horse ear designed connecting straps gave a wonderful view of her D-cup cleavage. Her lower half appeared to be a dark blue nylon bodysuit that perfectly outlined every detail; especially her more feminine one. They were like yoga pants for horses. Caleb sat speechlessly drinking in every detail of her adorable and entrancing appearance. Mirabelle notices him not saying anything."H-How does it look Dea?", Mirabelle inquires sheepishly hugging her waist."You...You look fantastic Bae!", Caleb stated"It's even better than the last outfit Mira!", Lyca added.Mirabelle eyes widen before a smile crosses her lips, "You really like it?""Like it? I love it! Really fits with your personality and British Centaur swagger!", Caleb commented supportively flashing two thumbs up. Lyca mimics him beaming her a toothy grin."Hahaha you're incorrigible Dear. And Thank you Lyca sweety for that but...Dear...~are you sure that's all you like about it~", Mirabelle chuckles before leaning in hugging her arms giving him a good view of her cleavage. Camilla notices tensing up then seeing Mirabelle quickly glance at her.Caleb smirks, "Heh, nope, I also see some big...beautiful...soft...purple eyes!", Caleb half-joked as she puffed her cheeks in annoyance."Errrr, you're such a right bloody tosser(British for obnoxious male) sometimes Dear, you know that?""Aww, thanks Moon pie. I still don't speak Brit so I'll just assume it's a good thing since it came from the mouth of a sweetheart.", Caleb slyly replies as Mirabelle playfully groans in agitation followed by the two of them sharing laugh together. Camilla looks between them saddened and slightly annoyed that she's being ignored now. Caleb glances at Camilla as well trying to pretend what almost happened didn't happen...The girls spent the rest of the time trying on more outfits with Caleb as their begrudging judge. It wasn't too bad as they all found several nice things to wear with assistance from the two Arachne girls. However, Caleb quickly noticed how their outfit became increasingly...suggestive; especially with Mirabelle and Camilla. He reached his limit when, with urging from said Arachne girls, the girls decided to model lingerie. Ein was one of the first objectors but was quickly outvoted by the other girls. Instead, Caleb opted to pay for the clothes Mirabelle, Camilla, and Lyca already picked out as an escape. The ever so "helpful" Arachne girls spun up all their clothing into a large net and had a lizard woman carry them for him.Caleb stood at the checkout counter as blonde Elf woman rung the last of his items."That'll be...584.67 sir.", she spokeCaleb recoils, "Yeesh, well alright. I using my ICEP host card.", he says taking our a small grey debit card with the ICEP logo.""Ah, then you qualify for our 15% discount. That'll be...496.97.""Ah, so it's only KINDA breaking the bank.", Caleb replies typing in the pin as the elf girl giggles.Suddenly, Caleb notices Julie and Augusta descend from the ceiling."Great, now what?", Caleb murmured under his breath not wanting to deal with them again."Excuse us, Mr. Caleb?", Julie spoke softly."We...would like to apologize. We didn't know-", Augusta spoke before Caleb cuts her off."It's fine! Don't worry about it! Now if you'll excuse me.", Caleb rebuffs about to walk away until..."Hey there bud, we finally found ya!", Came a familiar as the hair on Caleb neck stand and dread creeps up his spine. He turns to see Baldy approaching with his homestays, two Tetra Arms, in tow. Both of them with dark brown complexion and black tribal tattoos on different parts of their bodies, four arms, black hair, and golden earrings in each of their ears. One wore a yellow M&Ms shirt and the other worse a red M&M shirt.'Oh god fuckin dammit.', Caleb thought averting his gaze."Hey man, what was that all about? You just...bolted like you saw a ghost or somethin'. ", Baldy inquired."Yeah, we wanted to meet the 'Devil Savior' himself, Caleb Bezel.", spoke the Tetra in the red shirt."Hahhh, it's PRONOUNCED Bizzell and listen I really don't want or like to think about that night so can we please not talk about that?", Caleb says as the clothes are hoisted up to the ceiling by one of the spider girls. Caleb nods to June who takes the wrapped up clothes back to dressing rooms then prepares to follow her back. He's stopped when the yellow shirt Tetra grabs him by the arm with two hands."Aww, come on now handsome, no need to be shy. My little sis and I are doing one of those podcast things and we've been in need of a good subject to kick things off. And it just so happens your story is pretty popular right now so we're sure to rake in loads of viewers! That'll mean more subscribers, more subscribers means sponsorships and sweet ad money baby!", red shirt stated, "So how about letting us interview you?""Uhh, no thanks, I really don't want to talk about thi-Hey!", Caleb says pulling away only for the red shirt Tetra to pull yank him back."Come on dude?! We just need ja to answer some questions and stuff!""Yeah, don't be selfish! Lots of people wanna know your story.", Yellow shirt Tetra stated grabbing him by the other arm.'Hey, stop!", Caleb stated."Whoa, girls! What are you doing?", Spoke Baldy."Both of you stop! Let him go!", Augusta stated"Come on, bae! You know we can't pass up this chance for more viewership!", Yellow shirt Tetra retorted as Caleb struggled in her grip, "And would you stop being difficult and do the interview?!""No!", Caleb stated reaching his breaking point."Why not?!", Red demanded."I SAID NO!", Caleb shouted stomping hard on Red's foot."Hey!", Baldy angrily stated."Ahghhh son of a-!", Red stated releasing his arm to grab her foot hopping around as Yellow releases in surprise. Caleb uses the opportunity and bolts."Hey! You get back here asshole, you don't do that to my sis!", Yellow stated chasing after Caleb."Yeah you go sis!", Red stated following behind her."Hey, y'all get here! Don't be starting nothing!", Baldy stated going after them"Oh no, quick, go get Ms. Webster!", Augusta stated as Julie nod before stringing herself up to the ceiling.Caleb pushes through clothes racks with the two Tetras right behind him barking insults. Finally, he reaches the dressing room noticing Ein waiting patiently outside hers while Zwei changes."Ein! EIIIIIN! Help me out here please!", Caleb calls out to her"Mr. Bizzell?! What's-", Ein rises to her feet tail standing erect."Gotcha now asshole!", Yellow shouted tackling Caleb pinning him to the floor with all four arms.Ein lunges forwards grabbing the Tetra and ripping her off Caleb with seemingly little effort. Yellow Tetra swings on Ein, who easily dodges before performing a swift chop to her side, then knocking her off her balance."Dear!?", "Señor?!", "Chief?!", all three girls call out respectively bursting open their doors. All of them wearing nothing but their lingerie. Mirabelle in her black satin shoulderless bra with black lower body tights covering her body and legs like tights for horses. Camilla in her light blue lace bra and panties with light blue stocking and garters and matching translucent veil attached to her bra. Lyca in her black sports bra and matching panties. They're greeted with the sight of a Ein wresting a four armed Liminal to the ground and Caleb on the floor rubbing his head with another Tetra standing over him."The hell's going on out here?!", Zwei stated bursting from her room. She was dressing in her green lace lingerie before noticing the scene."A little help Zwei?!", Ein calls to her."On it!", Zwei stated pulling out a length of rope from...somewhere then hurrying over." You get off my sister bitch! This is between us and this guy!", Red stated pointing to Caleb as he tries getting yo his feet."Well now ju have to deal with me punta!", Camilla threatened forming a magic seal speed walking toward her ready to tear her to shreds." Ms. Sartana.", Mirabelle says worried she'll do something excessively violent."Yeah! Leave Chief alone!", Lyca snarled baring her fangs as Mirabelle turns to her. Her eyes dart around unsure just what to do."Hang I got THIIIIIIS!", Zwei exclaims tripping on the stack of jeans Ein threw at her earlier landing face first in front Camilla path."AHHHH!", Camilla exclaims tripping over Zwei wings unfolding instinctively to soften her fall just as Caleb was getting. She lands on top of him smothering his face with her face with her voluptuous breasts. Mirabelle shrieks at the sight as Caleb arms flailed and the others saw the scene."S-Sorry Señor!", Camilla stated raising of him covering her breasts while straddling his waist as Caleb sharply inhales catching his breath."Let go of my sister!", Red stated angrily"No, I am Ein Zyklon, I am with MON and you are both under arrest!", Ein stated back."For what?!", both Tetra stated simultaneously"Yeah for what?!", Baldy stated walking up to them standing front of Mirabelle's dressing room."EEEEEEEAAAAA!", Mirabelle shrieks covering herself from the strange man.a"Oh shit, I'm so sorry ma'am!", Baldy stated as the Centaur shuts the door."Don't you hurt Mira fatso!", Lyca snarled at the man."Don't you talk to him like that you mutt!", Red glared at Lyca."Don't YOU talk to her like that you fuckin weirdo!", Zwei shouted back defending her."Shut up rodent! This has nothing to do you! Our business with this assholes on the floor!""The hell it is! Ju touch him and I breaks all TWENTY of your fingers", Camilla threatened while still straddling Caleb."Camilla will you get off me please?!", Caleb stated not liking this position they're in."Everyone be quiet a calm-", Ein shouts but stops when spider silk attaches to her arm, "Down? WAAHHH!", Ein shouts before she, along with Caleb and everyone else (except Mirabelle) is hoisted up to the ceiling and wrapped up in spider silk. Mirabelle pokes her head out stunned by the scene. As they all dangle upside down squirming, complaining, and cussing, Mabeline appears arms folded in disappointment. Julie, Augusta, and June descend down beside her after wrapping everyone up."WHAT GIVES LADY?!", Red Tetra shouted at her."YEAH WHAT THE-MMPHH", Yellow shouted before Mabeline fire silk from her wrists wrapping up both their mouths."Now then, can someone PLEASE CALMLY tell me what all this is about?", Mabeline spoke authoritatively. Her three Arachne subordinates proceed to disband the small crowd that stopped to watch the scene. Among the them, Drei hid among them watching the scene with a dry expression."Sigh, so this is what happens when the protagonist looks away for ten minutes.", Drei uttered before noticing a few liminals women with phones out. She reaches and pulls out some green marbles sized balls, "Aaaand time to protect our image. Flick", Drei flicks one of the balls splattering a hipster human's phone with green goo then proceeding to do the same to other 'impromptu journalists'...After some time for everyone to decompress and properly explain themselves, they were able to resolves their grievances. Baldy and the two Tetra apologize, mostly the latter, apologize for how they behaved towards Caleb and Ein apologized for treating his homestay so roughly. Of course, Caleb and the other girls were a bit less willing to forgive but with some 'persuasion' by Mabeline they quickly did so. As a consolation, and so nobody presses charges against the other in her store, she also offered 30% discount on the clothes Baldy and Caleb's girls currently picked out. She even made arrangements to their delivery crew to drop all the clothes Caleb purchased to his house while they enjoy the rest of their day. Caleb paid for the rest of the girl's clothes and decided to leave along with the Zyklons. Baldy and the Tetra bid them farewell with the latter disappointed at not getting their interview. However, before they could leave, Caleb gave them ONE thing to use for their podcast: "I am not a hero. Nobody is. When shit happens, you just do what you feel is right. Anybody can do that, just put aside the trivial stuff."The Tetra left in slightly higher spirits as his quote seemed to please Mirabelle and the rest. Augusta and Julie, both eavesdropping on the scene, wanted to try apologizing again but they both decided to simply let him be.Feeling the need to forget the last half-hour, Caleb and the girls decided to have lunch at the outdoor barbecue place from earlier much to Lyca's delight. He also insisted the Zyklons join them.They all took a seat under the shaded canopy and take their orders. As the two Gargoyle men work their culinary magic permeated the area in delicious hickory smoked meats and veggie kabobs made exclusively for Mirabelle. The Zyklons sat to Caleb's right with their bags of new cloths right behind them and Mirabelle, Lyca, and Camilla to his left. All of them sat in rumination over today's...debacle."Alright. We are just gonna order our clothes from home from now on, K?", Caleb spoke up."Abso-bloody-lutely.", Mirabelle answer."That seems practical.", Ein agreed." We can do that?", Lyca inquires."We COULD have done that?!", Camilla stated." Eh, fine either way.", Zwei adds with a shrug."I make no such promises.", Drei replied."Good, we're in agreement. Hey, sir, get some drinks over here? You don't have Diet Dr. Pepper do ya?", Caleb asks the Gargoyle man." Heh, you're in luck bruh. Last one. That be a buck.", He says reaching into the cooler pulling out the can of perfectly chilled DD pepper as Caleb handed him a dollar. He then gives Mirabelle and the rest their own respective drinks. Caleb then notices another cooler and sticking out were yellow and black cans which he instantly recognized, "Hey, is that Alabama Slammers? I'll take on of those too.""Sure thing bruh.", He says in a chill tone as Caleb pays him for it. He then give him a clean glass and straw." What's a 'Alabama Slammer' Chief?", Lyca curiously inquired"It's a type of alcoholic drink exclusively sold in this state.", Caleb says opening both cans combining them both in one glass, "By itself it tastes like crap, but it gives DD pepper some kick. I call it a 'Dr. Slammer.' ""Sir, I really don't think you should be drinking so early in the day like this!", Ein stated."Ein, sweetheart, I haven't drank anything alcoholic in over a month and today's one those days that FEELS like a fuckin month. Please let me have this.", Caleb says before taking a swig of ."Yeah sis, let the man relax. Hey boss, mind if I try some of that?", Zwei says pointing to the half can of slammer. Caleb gives it to her to Ein's disapproval. Zwei tastes some and recoils, "Yick, yeah this...this definitely tastes like crap. Ugh, here try some Drei.""Passing pain unto your loved ones, song as old as time.", Drei commented before taking a swig.Caleb sighs before feeling a gentle caress on his arm."Don't feel bad about today my dear. We all got some wonderful clothes out of it. Plus, we're going out again tomorrow, let's rest when we get home. We can plan our list for Kame House!", Mirabelle assured.Caleb cracks a smile, "Yeah, you're right.""Sorry to keep you guys waiting. Enjoy!", the Gargoyles man stated putting trays of food in front of them. They all sat enjoying their meal chatting and slowly letting the memories of today fade away. As Caleb enjoyed his grill steak burger, he thought about what Mirabelle and looked forward to whatever tomorrow's outing had to bring.Narrator: "Again, oof."

Everyone else, enjoy.****...3:19 a.m...Mirabelle sat in her room in the dark of night legs folded inwards and eyes closed with head bowed in deep contemplation. Her entire body illuminating the darkness with a shimmering purple aura. At the same time, her astral form stood near the doorway observing her physical body. Her body was ethereal almost ghostlike with rippling light purple energy surrounding it. This was a common occurrence for her as since she didn't require much sleep anyway, she'd use the excess time on hobbies or keeping the skills of her clan sharp. It also allowed her time to think.Her astral projection proceeds to phase through the wall walking down the hall then stops at Camilla's door. She reaches allowing her hand to phase through before quickly retracting it then shaking her head. She knew deep in her heart it'd be wrong of her to do this especially after her promise to Camilla and the trust she has for Caleb. She turns away dissolving whatever doubt she had. Besides, there was another matter that heavily weighted on her.She walks through the dark, silent living room before turning to the sliding glass doors easily phasing through them until she was in the backyard. She walks around admiring her small garden even running her intangible fingers through the flower heads. She looks up at the night sky listening to the crickets chirping and other Southern nighttime sounds.'Hahhh, how could I let this happen?", Mirabelle sighed touching her fist to her chest. She couldn't deny she's becoming increasingly worried about Caleb's new abilities. Yesterday's example where he manifested a barrier made it too clear; he was manifesting HER abilities. She knew she needed to confront him about what it means...but even SHE doesn't have a clear answer. What could she do?...Meanwhile...Caleb, despite his initial reservations, was eventually able to relax alongside Camila. As he lay there lighly snoozing, his body suddenly shifts in discomfort feeling something pulling his chest. As he tries to fall back asleep he feels something sharp prick into his arm."Erk!", Caleb utters jerking awake welcomed by the darkness as grogginess, "uughh what the he-""Hhhnngh.", came a strained voice.Caleb stops upon seeing Camilla lying beside him pulling at his shirt and in deep slumber. Her entire body was trembling accompanied by the sound of whimpering slowly transitioning into quiet sobbing. Immediately, Caleb instincts kicked into action."Camilla?", Caleb says gently shaking her shoulder which seemed to only make the Elder Devil recoils more groaning in sorrow. Caleb heartrate quickens becoming even more concerned."No para No para No para"(No stop 3x)" , She sobbed in her sleep."Hey. Hey, Camilla!", Caleb shook her a bit harder only for her wings to suddenly unfurl almost smacking him and almost making him fall out the bed. He opts for a another method of waking her crawling to her say clearing seeing tears running down her cheeks and eyes clenched shut. He reaches up to brush her hair back."Camilla, come on, wake u-agh aghhhhh", Caleb uttered as, the second he touch her head, his eyes glowed bright purple as did the hood mark on his chest. His body spasmed as it became heavier and heavier before collapsing beside her straining out a few last grunts. Everything went black....Caleb lie on his back unconcious before his eyes shot open and he jerks his body upwards into a sitting position gasping for air. After a few seconds of heavy breathing, Caleb finally takes in the rather familiar. The purple mist and seemingly endless void of nothing made it clear he was in the dreamscape. However, something felt...different...foreign even. Whatsmore, there was no sign of Mirabelle anywhere. Caleb gets to his feet."Moon pie?", Caleb calls but gets no answer only the distant echo of his voice, "Moon pie, where are you? If your gonna pop out and scare me, please don't. I'm not in the mood...something...doesn't seem right."There was still no answer which made Caleb become more on edge. Despite it all being a dream, the danger from shock is very real.No. No. No. No., repeated a familiar voice.Caleb turns to see a winged silhouette standing just 20 feet from him. He immediately recognized that it was...Camilla. How the hell was she in the dreamscape? He quickly goes over to her noticing her attire being the same as when she went to bed"Camilla?! How are...how are you here?", Caleb inquires only for the Elder Devil to continue repeating the word "No" over and over. Caleb recoils knowing something wasn't right. Not only her chanting the word repeatedly but her entire demeanor gave off an aura of fear and, though he couldn't explain it, but her entire form felt...statue-like almost hollow.Caleb reaches out for her shoulder as she continued repeated the word and beginning to gradually do more rapidly the closer her he got, "Camilla? Are you ok? Hey! Camilla come on!...Hey, come on snap-", the second he touches her shoulder...NOOOOOOOOOO! , the Elder Devil violently elicits a deafening scream as the world around them is cast into bleak darkness and the sound shakes the surroundings like an earthquake. Caleb covers his ears trying to muffle the painful sound and feeling his entire body feeling as if it was being crushed at every angle. "Feeling" but actually it WAS being violently distorted into different shapes as the world around them changed into a blinding light forcing Caleb to sheild his eyes. The light soon dissipates.Opening his eyes and looking his hands to see they weren't distorted anymore, Caleb takes a moment to get his bearings. He looks around to find himself standing in the middle of some kind of ancient stone ruins. Despite that, he notices the surroundings appeared to have been well taken care of. There was very little overgrown vegetation. The stone structures, statues, and stairways appeared to be well taken care of. Taking a closer look he sees the symbols appeared be from the Mayan civilization that he read up on once. Walking around, he sees a stone channel along the ground with water flowing rapidly. There were even a small collection of apple trees further away. He looks up stunned to see a dome shaped stone wall with a large skylight allowing the natural sunlight in.His eyes widen realizing he had forgotten Camilla and was about to call out for her. Suddenly, he hears another voice call out instead."Madre!(Mother!)", Called the voice a female child. Caleb turns surprised to see a small Devil girl running towards him with an excited grin wearing a small polka dotted dress. He noted she looked kinda like Hana except with light brown skin instead of sky blue and her horns being slightly bigger. Caleb pivots to the right as she passes him. He then turns and sees the little Devil girl run up and hug another taller, older-looking Devil woman holding a basket of apples. She was dressed in an old fashioned dresses Mexican women wore in the mid-1800s with white, frilly shoulderless top, long red skirt reaching down to her ankels, and what appeared to be moccasins. She was very beautiful with a voluptuous hourglass figure, long flowing brown hair, four large black horns with two large matching batwings ,long slender tail ending in a spade, and sharp, piercing red eyes. She looks to the Devil girls with the sweetest smile Caleb had ever seen a woman give."Ohh, hola cariño! No te he visto desde esta mañ é has estado haciendo? (Oh, hello sweetheart! I haven't seen you since this morning. What have you been up to?), the woman spoke her words and tone sweet and smooth like honey to the ears. Caleb is surprised by the fact that the two of them are clearly speaking Spanish yet SOMEHOW he's able to understand what their saying. Maybe because it's dreamscape it just automatically translates in his brain? He didn't know."Hoy me levanté más temprano porque estaba practicando para mostrarte algo!(I wanted to practice a little more before I showed you!)", The Devil happily taking a ripe yellow apple from one of the several hand baskets that just noticed were all filled to the brim, "Mira esta mamá(Watch this mama!)The Devil girl holds the apple straight up in her palm then twirls a free hand above creating a small magic seal. The apple rotates in her palm as the skin goes flying off the apple in one long curly strand leaving a freshly peeled apple in hand."Ta Da!", The Devil girl stated proudly as the older Devils smiles widely touching her hands to her mouth in delighted surprise, "Quería ayudarte a que pelar las manzanas sea más fácil para ti( I wanted to help make peeling the apples easier for you.)""¡Ah! ¡Camilla Eso es fantástico! ¡Hiciste un nuevo hechizo tú solo! ¡Realmente eres mi adorable pequeño genio!(Ah! That's fantastic Camilla! You made a new spell all by yourself! You truly are my adorable little genius!)", The older Devil woman praised daughter pulling her daughter into a hug.'Wait...d-did she just say...Camilla? That's Camilla?! Is this her when she was...', Caleb thought to himself shocked by the revelation. Now it starting to make sense. These must be Camilla's memories manifested in dream form. Or whatever. Admittedly, there were some things Caleb didn't fully understand about the dreamscape and it's full capabilities.The Devil girl chuckles happily as her mom tickles her neck giggling sweetly at her daughter.""Oh, mamá, te hice esto también para ti("Oh, mama, I made you this for you too.), Baby Camilla stated presenting a small leather strand woven necklace with azure and turquoise beads.Jimena eyes twinkle, "¡Ahhhh, es hermoso bebé! Siempre lo apreciaré.(ahhhh, it's beautiful baby! I'll always cherish it.), she says before tying it around her neck.Caleb couldn't help smiling at the sight and noting how happy Camilla was back then."Oye, Jimena, ¿ya terminaste?(Hey, Jimena, you done yet?) " came an impatient female voice. Caleb turns to see a darker skinned Devil woman in a similar dress but with dark green skirt and beige top. Her arms were crossed under her I-Cup breasts with a judgemental expression. She was accompanied by 6 other Devil woman in different colors dresses, some with jewelry like bracelets, necklaces, and earrings. Each of them looking at Baby Camilla and her mom with coldness and even hints of disdain."¡Necesitábamos esas manzanas para el banquete de hoy hace 20 minutos! Darse prisa! (We needed those apples for todays banquet 20 minutes ago! Hurry up!)", spat another Devil woman in red skirt and a turquoise necklace.Baby Camilla looks to them slightly worried as her faces them with a plain expression."Ya está hecho, Adalia. Hubiera terminado antes si el resto de ustedes me hubiera ayudado. También es parte de tus quehaceres.(It's already done, Adalia. I would've finished sooner if the rest of you would've helped. It's part of your chores too.) ", Camilla mother answered back plainly."¿Qué? Y negarle a la gran Jimena el honor de recoger la fruta más fresca para nuestro señor. Después de todo, pareces ser el experto en frutas(What? And deny the great Jimena the honor of picking out the freshest of fruit for our lord. You seem to be the expert on fruit after all.), the green skirted Devil woman, apparently named Adalia, jeered before shooting a glare at Baby Camilla causing the latter to recoil slightly.Jimena takes Baby Camilla's hand comfortingly before conjuring a large yellow magic seal. Immediately, all the baskets become surrounded in yellow aura and begin to levitate."Empezaré los preparativos ahora si te parece bien(I shall start the preparations now if that's ok with you?), Jimena inquired in a calm tone, "Ven cariño(Come along honey)"Jimena and Baby Camilla proceed together as the other Devil women step aside allowing them to pass while the baskets floated behind them in single file line. As the passed, Baby Camilla sees the cold, envious glares of the other Devil women; especially Adalia.Suddenly, one of the baskets rips at the bottom spilling all the apples on the ground. Baby Camilla and her mother turn to see the apples on the ground and, for a split second, Adalia dissipating a magic seal in her palm."¡Oh querido! Parece que no podría soportar su propio peso. Deberías limpiar esto antes de que nuestro señor se entere!(Oh dear! It looks like that couldn't handle it's own weight. You should clean this up before our lord finds out.), Adalia spoke in a haughty tone wanting to get a rise out of her.Jimena narrows her eyes at her knowing she's trying to provoke her. Then, to other Devil's surprise, Baby Camilla goes to the torn basket and creates a small blue magic seal and instantly repairs it before proceeding to put them all in by hand."Está bien, madre, conseguiré estos y los limpiaré du siente.(It's ok, mother. I get these and clean them off for you.), Baby Camilla smiles supportingly as her mother's expression softens."Gracias cariño( Thank you honey)",Jimena spoke sweetly as then shooting a side glance at Adalia. The darker skin Devil scowls at her as the rest look on with envy in their eyes."Tch, lo que sea (Tch, whatever.), Adalia scoffs before walking ahead then the others followed behind her. Adalia stops next to Jimena and whispers what sounded like, "No dejes que esa pequeña mierda te haga olvidar tu lugar aquí, perra. Pure Luck, eso es todo lo que es. Una vez que dé a luz a un niño fuerte, volveré a estar en la cima. Recuerda eso.(Don't let that little shit make you forget your place here bitch. Pure Luck, that's all she is. Once I give birth to a strong child, I'll be back on top. Remember that.), she spoke before grabbing an apple and taking a bite.As she walks by the other devil women tauntingly grab an apple as well following Adalia out of the courtyard. Baby Camilla watches as her mother stands there silently before turning around with a slightly forced smile on her face assuring her daughter all was well.Caleb walks up to Baby Camilla then reaches out to her. Before he could even touch her, the surroundings distorts and violently change creating earthquake-like tremors that through Caleb off balance causing him to fall on his butt. He notices the new surroundings. This time he was in an ancient burial chamber except there were large wooden tables and stone coffins fashioned into seats. Several Mayan statues and clay structures could be seen littered throughout the room but with strange black marking such as pentagrams and demonic symbols painted on them. However, what caught Caleb's attention the most were the were dozens upon dozens of Devil women of various species and size all around him. He could see a line of them bringing in plates of food from batches of cooked corn to roasted pork, chicken, and goat to what looked like stacks of tortillas with chili beans. The even brought in crates of alcohol; mostly tequila brewed on their own."¡¿Que demonios?! ¡Esto sabe a mierda!(What the hell?! This tastes like shit!), screamed a male voice.Caleb turns around shocked to see a man standing up from what looked like a hand carved stone chair with demonic symbols painted all over. He was a tall, tan-skinned Devil man with a very muscular physique, her black horns, claws, and tail, sharp, knife-like teeth, and piercing red eyes made even more intimidating by his very agitated glare. He was dressed in loose brown pants and open dark brown vest showing his defined abs, along with black heeled boots He was clutching what looked to be a roasted goat.Caleb steps back from him out of fear. He then notices Camilla's mom next to him with an even more fearful expression."Lo-lo siento ... cariño, creo que podría haber cocido demasiado la carne un bi - ¡AGHH!(I-I'm sorry...darling, I guess I might have overcooked the meat a bi-AGHH!)", was all she could get out before the Devil man delivers a hard, claw swipe across her face; the sound resinating throughout the room."Fuck!", Caleb shouted in utter shock. He looks on seeing Camilla's mom on the floor clenching the side of her bleeding face and whimpering. Caleb could also see Adalia near the table smirking in satisfaction."Mama!", Baby Camilla shouted running towards only for a another Devil woman to grab her holding her back."¡NO! ¡Cariño, quédate atrás! ¡Mami está bien!(NO! Sweety, stay back! Mommy is ok!), Jimena urges still clenching her cheek as is starts to regenerate."Ese pequeño. Escucha a mami, al menos ELLA podría convertirme en un heredero medio decente. ¡Incluso si no puede cocinar para una mierda!(That right little one. Listen to mommy, at least SHE could make me a halfway decent heir. Even if she can't cook for shit!), The Devil Man stated sadistically before throwing the goat right at Jimena's face. Caleb flinches at the sight before clenching his teeth in anger."Pfft.", scoffs Adalia crossing her armsThe Devil Man heard her and turns his attention to Adalia. He walks up to her until they were face to face."¿Oh qué? ¿Me equivoco? ¿O simplemente estás enojado porque es verdad? A diferencia de ti y de los demás, ELLA en realidad me dio un hijo y APRAMENTE lleva aquí medio siglo. Ni siquiera puedes hacer que dure un mes.(Oh, what? Am I wrong? Or you just mad because it's true? Unlike you, and the others, SHE actually produced me a child and she's BARELY been here half a century. You can't even make it last a month.), The Devil Man taunted her and the other Devil women before focusing solely on Adalia as she clenches her fists trying to restrain her anger."Bueno, pasaste tus noches con ella desde que llegó. ¡Ya casi no quieres tocar a la mitad de nosotros!(Well, you spent of your nights with her since she got here. You barely want to touch half of us anymore!), Adalia shot back breathing hard in agitation."Oh, ¿estás diciendo que te estoy descuidando? ¿Crees que puedes hacerlo esta vez?(Oh, you saying I'm neglecting you? You think you can do it this time?), Devil Man spoke to which Adalia simply nods affirmatively. A wicked grin crosses his lips, "En ese caso, demuéstrelo ahora mismo!(In that case, then prove it right now!)Devil Man grabs Adalia by the throat dragging her as she gasps and struggles. A throws her on the table bending her over then proceeding to yank her skirt up as she squirms. He chuckles heartily at her reaction then commands two more Greater Devils to hold her arms down. Caleb turns away in disgust then notices Baby Camilla struggling in the Greater Devil's grasp before her mother comes over and tears her away wrapping her daughter securely in her arms.Caleb covers his ears trying to block out the sound of Adalia moaning and ragged shrieks along with the DevilMan's boisterous laughing echoes throughout the room. Caleb notices, to his shock, that some of the Devil women at the table simply continued eating as if nothing was happening. He then sees Baby Camilla touch her mother's face which had mostly healed up. She looks to her so called father relentlessly thrusting the other Devil woman against the table then glares at him. Suddenly, her body begins to radiate a strange red aura.Suddenly, the world distorts and dissolves into shapeless colors and forms followed by violent tremors shaking the area."Oh God, not again?", Caleb stated expecting to be transported to another memory. Instead, he is bombarded with more visions of Camilla's life in her clan. There were happier memories like ones where she helping her mother cooking, her mother teaching her spells, or Camilla practicing drawing her mother. Then there were...not so happy ones where her mother was bullied and harassed by the other Devil women or forcing her to do their chores for them. Her "father" verbally, physically, and sexually abusing and humiliating her mother; especially in front of other Devil women. Even days where her would be caught sobbing when she thought no one was watching. Most of the time, when her mother was busy, Baby Camilla would be by herself as there were no other children to play with and the other Devil women wanted nothing to do with her. Then, Caleb sees a memory where Camilla was at a river and she witnessed Adalia caring a wooden bucket weeping as three other Devils comforted her. She then dumps the remains of her failed pregnancy into the river. She then notices Camilla watching them before an angered scowl crosses her face. At the moment, Caleb could sense Camilla realized why they hated her. Each memory causing waves of emotion from anger, resentment, sadness, love, and happiness flooding Caleb's mind with overwhelming force that threatened to rip him apart.Caleb clutches the sides of his head in agony and shrieks, "STOP!"At that moment, the flood of emotions stops and he finds himself standing in some type bedchamber. He heard a small whimper and turn to see Baby Camilla standing there with a horrified expression holding a wooden plate of freshly peeled fruit, roast chicken, and a bottle of tequila."AGHH!", shouted the voice of Camilla mother. Caleb turns horrified to see Devil Man pinning her against the stone wall, "P-¡Por favor, señor, estoy tan cansado! Los otros no me ayudarían(P-Please my lord I'm so tired! The others wouldn't help me-)*Smack*, Devil Man backhand slaps her across the face."¿Por favor? ¡Dáme un respiro! ¡Eres la gallina de los huevos de oro! Además, ¡que te molesten los demás realmente hace que este coño sea agradable y apretado!(Please? Give me a break! You're the goose that golden eggs! Besides, you getting all bothered by the others really make this pussy nice and tight!), Devil Man stated jamming his middle and ring fingers in her womanhood causing her to lurch backward in pain. Camilla trembles placing the food on a nearby table."Madre(Mother!)", Baby Camilla stated with uncertain eyes."Está bien, cariño, solo vete. Mami estará bien como siempre.(I-It's alright sweety, just go. Mommy will be ok like always.), Jimena assured in a strained voice trying to force a smile."Madre.(Mother)", Baby Camilla whimpers as tears start to form. Caleb frowns sorrowfully at her then is interrupted by Jimena's strangled gasp as Devil Man grabs her throat."JA, ¿qué crees que eres una mamá REAL? Eres solo un arranque abierto para sembrar mi semilla. ¡ESO ES! ¡Ese es tu propósito! ¡Ahora vas a dar otro genio como ese de allí!(HA, what you think you're a REAL mom? You're just an open snatch to sew my seed. THAT'S IT! That's your purpose in our species! Now, you're gonna give me another genius just like that one over there!), Devil Man mocked choking her harder forcing her into submission. He lifts up her skirt then grabs under her thigh lifting her leg up showing Baby Camilla her mother's soaking wet pussy, "¿Ves a este pequeño? Eres solo la placenta de mi semilla que se deslizó fuera de esta abertura. Afortunadamente, no eras totalmente inútil o te habría echado hace mucho tiempo.(See this little one? You're just the afterbirth of my seed that slithered out of this opening. Luckily, you weren't totally worthless or I would've thrown you out a long time ago.)"P-Por favor, n-no la d-dejes ver esto! AH!(P-Please d-don't l-let her watch this! AH!)", Jimena begs before he slaps her." ¡Cállate tú! Ella necesita aprender tan temprano de todos modos. Dónde está su lugar y dónde estará cuando sea mayor. ( Shut up you! She needs to learn this early anyway. Where her place is and where she'll be when she's older.), DevilMan stated looking back at Baby Camilla with a lecherous smirk as he unfastened his pants before turning his attention back to Jimena.Caleb clenches his fist looking for some way to stop this. He reaches and grabs for the tequila bottle only for his hand to phase right through it with a cloud of purple smoke. He curses figuring that his body can't physically interact with a memories.Suddenly, to his surprise, Baby Camilla grabs the tequila bottle and charges DevilMan."¡Deja de lastimar a mamá!(You stop hurting Mama!), Baby Camilla shouted before smashing the bottle against his back digging shards into his wings and back. He releases Jimena as her hunches over grabbing his bleeding lower back before turning to Camilla with rage-filled eyes."GAHH! ¡PEQUEÑA MIERDA !(YOU LITTLE SHIT!), He bellows before smashing his fist against Camilla's face sending her body smashing through the wooden door of the room. Caleb's jaw drops as anger fills his being."SON OF A BITCH!", Caleb rushes him and swings his fist only for his body to phase right through DevilMan's body then tumbling on the floor from loss of balance and phasing through the wall landing next to Camilla body. Caleb smacks the floor trying to get a hold of himself. He knew none of it was real...but still. He looks over to Baby Camilla in a fetal position clenching her broken, bloody nose and whimpering. He notices the other Devil women surrounding them curious of what was happening.Devil Man approaches, his body radiating a rippling red and black aura, "Guh ... maldito miserable. ¡¿Me levantas la mano ?! ¡¿Eh?!(Guh...you miserable little fuck. You raise your hand at me?! Huh?!)", he spoke every word laced with venom and rage. He clenches his bleeding back picking the shards out and flick a couple at Camilla. It was around this time that Caleb spotted Adalia emerging from the group with a shocked expression. Devil Man stands over Baby Camilla before reaching down and grabbing the horns on the side of Camilla's head before yanking her up so her feet can't touch the floor."AGHHHHH!", Camilla elicits an agonizing shriek desperately flailing and kicking her legs to free as tears trickle down her face."¡SI! SÍ, ¿eso duele? ¡Conoce tu lugar, pequeña mierda débil! ¡No vayas pensando que eres algo especial! ¡Siempre puedo hacer otro diablillo como tú!(YEAH! YEAH, does that hurt?! Know your place you weak little shit! Don't go thinking you're anything special! I can always make another imp just like you!), Devil Man screams at her brandishing his claws fingers like a dagger at Camilla's neck drawing some blood. Adalia and several other Devil women give horrified expressions while some turn away not wanting to look."NO STOP!", Caleb shouts to the top of his lungs. At that moment, a bolt of red lightning concentrated into a solid straight laser struck DevilMan's arm severing it from his body in a splash of blood. Camilla falls to the floor the severed limb still clutching her horns. Shocked silence befell Caleb and the other Devil women as the only could be heard was DevilMan's wailing cries."MI BRAZO ! FOLLAR FOLLAR FOLLAR FOLLAR FOLLAR FOLLAR FOLLAR ! MI BRAZO(MY ARRMM! FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK! MY ARM!", He screams in agony as blood spurts all over the floor. He turns around to see Jimena pointing a large red magic seal with a cold, furious expression black aura around her body, "¡DIOS ESTÁ MAL CONTIGO, PERRA ESTÚPIDA !(THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU, YOU STUPID BITCH!)Jimena sways toward him, "No me importa lo que me hagas, dímelo, piensa en mí ... ¡pero YO SOY su madre! Y...no... TOQUES A MI BEBÉ !(I don't care what you do to me, say to me, think of me...but I AM her mother! And you...do not TOUCH MY BABY!), she shouts before punching him across the face knocking him to the floor as the other Devil women watch unable to fully process what was happening.Baby Camilla rips the severed limb from her head before her falls to her knees scooping her daughter in her arms cradling her."Mama.", Baby Camilla murmurs weakly."Está bien. Está bien cariño, mamá está aquí, mamá está aquí.(It's ok. It's ok sweetheart, Mommy's here, Mommy's right here.), Jimena assured wiping daughters tears away and rocking her body. The other Devil women, particularly Adalia, watch them with, not envy or disdain, but genuine yearning. Caleb couldn't help letting a smile cross his lips. It was short-lived however.DevilMan creating a small purple magic seal around his wound to stop the bleeding then glares at the pair with crazed malice, "¡Vas a pagar por esto! ¿Crees que puedes hacerme esto y salirte con la tuya?(You're going to pay for this! You think you can do this to ME and get away with it?!)He then turns to the other Devil women, "¡MATARLA! ¡MATARLOS A LOS DOS! (KILL HER! KILL THEM BOTH!)At those words, the other Devil women hesitate to react at all some feeling very conflicted. Adalia is the first to step up. Jimena immediately scoops Camilla up about to run only for several other women to block her path. She then sees Adalia quite reluctantly raising her arm as a blue magic seal forms above. A beam of blue energy fires down which Jimena dodges before creating a yellow magic seal."¡Cúbrete los ojos cariño!(Cover your eyes sweety), Jimena whispers to Camilla. Camilla does as instructed as Jimena throws a ball of yellow energy upward before making it burst in a blinding flash of light. Devil Man, along with Adalia and the other Devil women, sheild their eyes as Jimena uses the opportunity to perform a vertical leap over the Devil girls blocking her way before making a run for it.After a few second the light dissipates. Caleb feels himself transported to the scene of Camilla her mother fleeing."¡No se queden ahí, idiotas! ¡Después de ellos!(Don't just stands there you idiots! After them!), Caleb heard Devil Man commanded as Adalia and several come sprinting or flying after them. He watches as Camilla turns corner after corner dodging magic attacks before seeing the entrance in sight. Jimena looks behind her seeing multiple Devil women on her tail. She forms of black magic seal before form a large black and purple ball of pulsating energy and firing it in their direction. It exploded in torrent of black and purple flames badly burning some of the Devil women. She continues forward with Camilla in her arms. Jimena could see the light shining through but as soon as she close enough to freedom she sees a figure standing in the entryway with a red magic seal pointed at her and comes to a hault. It was Adalia glaring at her intently readying her spell.Jimena shields Camilla and puts up her own red magic seal. Caleb watches as the two Devil women have a stare down seeing who'll make the first move. Baby Camilla then turns around herself toward Adalia with a pleading expression. Adalia's expression softens in a saddened frown as she slowly lowers her arm dissipating the spell much to Jimena's and Caleb's surprise. Adalia arms hang limply to her sides looking at Jimena and Camilla with defeat in her eyes. She sidesteps then walks by Jimena allowing her go free. She looks back as Jimena nods to her."Ve ahora(Go, now)", she uttered in a low voice. Jimena smiles solemnly at her before turning and running away. Caleb finds himself dragged along the scene again, seeing from Camilla's perspective, Adalia watching them silently with a somber expression. Jimena comes to the edge of the mountain clifface. Baby Camilla looks out at the sunset covered vast canyons and breathing in the fresh air mountain air.Jimena spreads wings catching the flowing breeze."Agárrate fuerte de mí, cariño.(Hold on to me tight, sweetheart.), Jimena advices her daughter who nods in understanding wrapping her arms tightly. Jimena does a couple test flaps then gets a running start then leaping off the cliff. As the updraft carries her wings, Jimena smiles to her daughter who happily returns it; both feeling truly as the fly into the sunset. Then...*STRIKE*"AAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!", Jimena elation is replaced with agony as a bolt of red and black lightning pieces her back through her chest. Camilla and Caleb jaws dropping as time seems to slow to a crawl. Camilla looks behind her and Caleb is able to see, from her perspective, what appeared to be Devil Man stand at the cliff edge. His body surrounded by blood red aura and a very large red magic seal with covered in ancient demonic symbols. Behind him, Adalia lay on the ground motionless. As Jimena and Camilla take a dive, the chilling sound of his sneering laughter echoes throughout the canyon.They go into a corkscrew dive as Jimena falls in and out of consciousness with Camilla desperately try to keep her awake."¡MADRE! MOTHERRRR ! ¡POR FAVOR DESPIERTA! ¡POR FAVOR! ¡MADRE!"(MOTHER! MOTHERRRR! PLEASE WAKE UP! PLEASE! MOTHER!), Baby Camilla pleads as they get closer and closer to the jagged canyon rocks. Camilla sees her mother unconcious and the ground getting closer and closer. Caleb could feel every rush of emotion even the feeling of impending death overwhelming his senses. On pure instinct and with a sharp cry, Baby Camilla creates a large blue magic seals fires a beam of blue energy( similar to Adalia's) and vaporizes the jagged rocks into dust producing an updraft that slows their momentum. The two of them tumble on the ground. Camilla goes unconcious as Caleb finds himself in total darkness again."Oh God...", Caleb murmurs to himself regaining his bearing and feeling like he needed to throw up."...Mill...a...Por...Ca..illa", a distorted voice spoke in the darkness. It gradually becomes cleared until."CAMILLA!", stated the voice of Jimena. The world changes and Caleb finds himself in a small cave illuminated by three small glowing balls of yellow energy. Baby Camilla eyes shot open rising from her slumber."M-Madre?(Mother)", Camilla uttered languidly before Jimena wraps her in a tearful hug."¡Gloria al caos! ¡Estás bien! ¡Mi bebé está bien!(Glory to chaos! You're alright! My baby is alright!), Jimena wept pushing Baby into her ample bosom."M-Mamá ... no puedo respirar.(M-Mama...can't breath.), Baby Camilla uttered pushing herself up from her mother's iron grip.After a minutes, the two get their bearings. Jimena could be seen pointing a small blue magic seal sending ripples of blue energy throughout Camilla's body healing her wounds."Ahí todo mejor.(There all better.), Jimena spoke finishing up before dissipating the seal. Camilla thanks her then looks out to the pitch blackness of the nighttime atmosphere. She could hear coyote howling and crickets chirping in the distance. Caleb watches them silently."Mamá, ¿dónde estamos?(Mama, where are we?) Jimena look off into the night, "No lo sé, cariño."(I don't know sweety.), she then positions herself making direct eye contact and a serious expression, "Cariño, nunca volveremos allí.(We are not going back there.)Baby Camilla nods in understanding."Estaremos bien. Vamos a vivir solos, ahora solo nosotros dos.(We will be alright. We are going to live on our own, just the two of us now.), Jimena says reassuringly touch a hand to the necklace beaded necklace."¡S-sí, madre!(Y-yes, mother!), Camilla replies with a grin."¡Así es! Nosotros - NGGHHH !(That's right! We-NGGHHH!", Jimena cuts herself off lurching forward clenching the left side of her chest."Mama?!", Baby Camilla stated very concerned as Caleb watches equally as concerned. Camilla then notices the dark black and red circular burn wound around the upper left section of her chest. She then remembers DevilMan's attack from earlier and anxiety sets in.Jimena notices her daughters panicked expression, "Estoy bien, cariño. Es solo ... una pequeña herida. ¡Solo duele por un tiempo pero se curará eventualmente!(I-I'm fine Sweety. It's just...a little wound. It only hurts but it will heal eventually!), she assured her.Camilla looks at the wound again them to her mother and decides to trust her words.Jimena and Baby Camilla sit near the entrance of the cave together listening to the nighttime atmosphere and looking up at the crescent moon."Cariño, una cosa más, recuerda lo que dije sobre los humanos."(Sweety, one more thing, remember what I said about humans.), Jimena spoke cautioning her daughter, "Debemos hacer todo lo posible para que nunca nos vean o nos atrapen. Son criaturas simples que matan lo que no entienden y su miedo no conoce límites. Pueden ser peligrosos cuando demasiados temen a un enemigo común. ¿Entender?(We must do our best to never let them see or catch us. They are simple creatures that kill what they don't understand and their fear knows no limits. They can be dangerous when too many fear a common enemy. Understand?)"Si Mama.", Baby Camilla replied.Caleb watches them sitting staring into the night sky Suddenly, everything in the world dissolves into blackness followed by a rumbling that shook the entire area. Caleb finds himself launched forward like a rocket by an invisible force."Ohhh hell! Where we going now?!", Caleb calls out to the uncaring void. The darkness fades replaced by a faint light along with theater screen like projection flood Caleb's vision. All of them telling the story of Camilla and her mother's life surviving on their own.. From he could gather so far, things for them started off well. By day, they hunted and gathered food and water while avoid human detection. By night, they found shelter or moved about under the cover of night.It didn't last however. Around this time, the country was in a dark period of war and upheaval between the Mexican forces and the indigenous humans Camilla's mother knew as the Apache and Comanche tribes through HER mother's encounters with them. U.S. also became involved in battles against the Mexican army. Whatsmore, the social and political unrest led to a rise in bandit activity. Caleb eyes widened seeing gruesome and horrific images flooding his senses. Camilla and her mother bore witness to many violent, barbaric, and horrific displays of human behavior. Apache and Mexican villages raided, burned down, by Mexican and U.S. army men; enslaving, killing, dismembering, humiliating, and raping whatever unfortunate survivors. Native tribes raiding and killing Mexican farmers and miners. Banditos raiding Comanche villages; murdering and kidnapping young women.Not only did it become harder for the two of them move about undetected but overhunting and land seizures made it harder for the two to obtain food and drinkable water. Eventually, to her mother's reluctance, they resorted to stealing from army supply carts and village storehouses. For shelter, they'd typically set up small camps in caves, abandoned villages, or even an abandoned covered wagon. There were times where they came across other liminal species. Some were friendly, some indifferent towards them, others hostile and unwilling to share in any food or safe haven they occupied. It was for situations like this Jimena began training Camilla to properly defend herself against these dangerous non-humans. Angels in particular.Nineteen years pass and, as she got older, Camilla fear soon grew to loathing towards the humans who she saw as no better, possibly, WORSE than her 'father'. Her only comfort being her ever supportive mother who constantly made her feel at home no matter where they ended up. However, she could always her mother was hiding something from her. Whenever they were close to each other, she always seemed to purposely cover up her upper chest as much as possible. She also seemed to have less energy to travel. Not to mention her mother gradually began using her magic less and less often, especially when it came to when any human came dangerously close to discovering them. She always assured Camilla she was fine however. Camilla didn't mind honestly. She didn't know what her mother was hiding but chose not to push her to answer. She trusted her. She would've done anything to protect her mother. Anything."Wah!", Caleb stated suddenly finding himself near a flowing river near the base of a mountain with patches greenery close to the waters. It was daytime possibly late afternoon. He then notices Teen Camilla standing ankle deep near the river bank with her sandals close to by. She wore a light brown hooded cloak covering her horns and wings and a long knee length red skirt. Caleb notices how much she's grown. She now looked to be in her mid to late teens( despite the fact that, chronologically, she's about 63 years old.) with more defined feminine feature. She raises her hand concentrating as a green magic seal appears on the water. Five fish come levitating out of the water flopping and wiggling before going limp when Teen Camilla hits them with a jolt of green electric sparks. They then go floating piling up in a basket Teen Camilla held in hand." Perfecto", Teen Camilla spoke in satisfaction at her successful catch of the day. She holds them under her arm, puts her sandals back on, than proceeds back to her and her mother's new hideout. Today, her mother felt especially tired and stayed behind to rest. As she begins to make her way back...*bang bang*Teen Camila stops in her tracks before hearing a few more gunshots. Using her hyper sensitive hearing, she could tell they were coming from...the direction of their hideout. Accompanied by it were, horses neighing, men laughing, and... her mother's shrieks!Immediately Teen Camilla springs into action dropping the basket as she sprinted towards her mother's location. Camilla soon arrives at the hideout, her eyes widen in horror a seven Banditos and their horses at their hideout. Three of them hooting ecstatically while shooting at the glass jugs of water Camilla collected earlier and rummaging through the supplies they collected. Four of them surrounded Jimena on horseback taunting as they circled her like a merry-go-round. Jimena also was dressed in light brown cloak to hide her less human features."VUELTA Y VUELTA LA CHICA BONITA VA! ¡DÓNDE SE DETIENE SOLO YO LO SÉ!(ROUND AND ROUND THE PRETTY GIRL GOES! WHERE SHE STOPS ONLY I KNOWS!), the men taunted boxing her in tighter and tighter. One of them jumps off their horse tackling her to the ground then ripping her cloak exposing her breasts as Jimena screams in shock as the other men dismount their horse to join the fun. The man then rips her hood from her head. The other men are struck speechless upon seeing her devil horns and tail. The guys on top her face turns pale and freezes in shock. Jimena proceeds to deliver a solid punch to the attempted rapists jaw sending him flying a couple feet back. She gets to get feet eyed darting at the men staring wordlessly at her realizing her cover was blown." Dios mio(my God)", one of the men uttered.Camila takes opportunity creating three green magic seals on each of the men who trashed their stuff lighting them up with green electric sparks as the shout in intense pain before collapsing to the ground. The other men turn their attention two Camilla who pull off her hood exposing herself as well."¡Demonio! ¡Esbirros de Satanás!(Demon! Minions of Satan!), one of the men shouted hysterically before firing his gun at Camila. She dodges then delivers a hard sweep kick to the man knocking him into his horse startling the other horses into running away. Jimena one of the other bandits reach for his gun and points her hand protecting a magic seal only for it to suddenly flicker before disappearing."Muere Satanás(Die Satan!)", The man shouts before shooting Jimena in the chest."AGHHH!", Jimena shouts.Camilla eyes widen as her mother collapses to the ground. Everything around her fades. The only thing she feels right now...is rage."RAAGHHH!", Teen Camilla screams quickly creating a red magic seal firing a red fireball that burn a hole right through the man's chest. He falls to the ground convulsing in agony. She turns to the other bandit Jimena kicked who was staggering to get up the shoot a bolt of compressed red energy. It rips through his skull slicing off the top half. His body fall leaving only the lower jaw attached to his body. She then turns to the three unconcious men creating a large energy the launching it at them. Their bodies are engulfed in huge flames incinerating them. Camilla couldn't help smiling in satisfaction."Jesus Christ!", Caleb stated in profound shock.Teen Camilla turns to the bandit who tries forcing himself on her mother; leaving him for last. He lay on his back muttering gibberish as fear overtook his body. Camilla approaches him with bloodlust and anger in her eyes.She creates two orange magic seals around his knees. The man screams in agony as both kneecaps feel like they had a machete driven right through them and painting the dirt red with blood. Teen Camilla does the same to both his arms totally crippling him as he hollers out in sheer agony. Camilla plants her foot on his chest towering over him wings unfolded blocking the sun, eye glowing red, and teeth bared in a rather imposing display."Dios te salve, María, llena eres de gracia, el Señor es contigo. Bendita tú entre todas las mujeres, y bendito el fruto de tu vientre, Jesús. Santa María, Madre de Dios, ruega por nosotro-(Hail Mary, Full of Grace,The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinn-), The man quickly utters his last prayer tears in his eyes before Teen Camilla pushes hard on his ribcage elicits a pained groan."¿Crees que vas al cielo? ¿Escoria vil como tú? No, definitivamente no." (You think you're going to heaven? Vile scum like you? No. Definitely not.), Camilla stated readying a magic seal directly on his forehead."CAMILLA ! ¡Es suficiente! ¡Detener! ¡Por favor deje de!(CAMILLA! That is enough! Stop! Please stop!), Jimena begged grabbed her daughter by the shoulders.¡Pero madre, nos atacaron! ¡Te dispararon!(But mother, they attacked us! They SHOT you!), Camilla then glares hatefully at the man on the ground, "¡Éste!(This one!)Jimena steps in front of Teen Camilla. A horried expression on her face.Lo sé cariño, ¡pero estoy bien!¡Mira, ya estoy curado! ¿Ver? (I know sweetheart but I am ok now! I have already healed! See? It's OK.), Jimena assured showing her now healed bullet wound, ¡Vámonos, AHORA! ¡Olvídate de el!(Lets just leave, NOW! Forget about him!), she urges.¿Cómo puedo cuando hay cientos MÁS como él? CIENTOS hombres más ... como él, todos los días a nuestro alrededor.(How can I when there's hundreds MORE just like him! HUNDREDS more men...just like him, all around us everyday.), Teen Camilla stated her words filled with venom gesturing to their ruined hideout then point an accusatory finger at the bandit.¡Lo sé bebé pero no seas como ellos! Somos que ellos, somos mejores que ÉL ! Por favor bebé. Cio.(I know baby, I know, but don't be like them! We are better than this, we are better than HIM! Please baby. Stop.), Jimena spoke caressing her face forcing direct eye contact. Camilla's rage filled expression softens for a moment.*Click*Teen Camilla and her mother are brought from their tender moment by the distinct sound of a gun cocking it trigger. Without hesitating, Teen Camilla pushes her mother to the side before receiving a gunshot to the shoulder. She screams at the burning pain. The bandit pulls the trigger back firing again hitting her in the side making her lurch holding her side. He quickly pulls the trigger back again."NO!", Jimena shouts creating a blue magic seal only for it to flicker away. He points and aims the gun at Jimena head."RHHAA!",Teen Camilla screams as a large red magic seal forms around the man's body, much to his befuddlement. Before he could utter a shriek, his body is diced into pieces leaving a pile of dismembered body parts with pool of blood washing over the dirt and grass. Jimena and Caleb look on in profound horror. Teen Camilla pants trying to catch her breath as a satisfied smirk crosses her lips which her mother notices.¿Ves lo que quiero decir madre? ¡La basura SIEMPRE será basura! Madre, no sé qué está pasando con tu magia, pero no tienes que preocuparte. ¡Te protegeré! ¡NADIE te apartará de mí! ¡Mataré a cualquiera que intente tocarte!(See what I mean mother?! Garbage will ALWAYS be garbage! Mother, I don't know what's going on with your magic but you don't need to worry. I will protect you! NOBODY will take you from me! I'll butcher anyone who tries to touch you!), Teen Camilla ranted with maniacal bloodlust in her eyes as her wound regenerate. Caleb backs away trembling slightly the smell of blood, burning bodies, and death filling his nostrils.Jimena stares at Camilla slowly shaking her head with a deeply saddened and horrified expression. Suddenly, her mother falls to her knees coughing and clutching her chest."¿Q-qué pasa madre? ¿Madre?(W-What's wrong mother? Mother?), Teen Camilla utters in a worried tone rushing to her side. Her eyes widen seeing the blood her mother cough in her palm. The second Camilla touches Jimena arm, her eyes widen in fear."¡N-NO! ¡Quedarse atrás!(N-NO! Stay back!)", Jimena stated yanking her arm away to Camilla's shock before standing up covering her arm and chest. Jimena realizes what she had done, "Espera, no nena, eso no es lo que yo ... yo ...(W-Wait no, baby that's not what I meant...I...), Jimena assured trailing off. Her heart wrenching seeing her daughters hurt expression."Madre?(mother?)", Teen Camilla uttered in a low voice."¡Tenemos que irnos, antes de que vengan más bandidos o apaches!(W-We have to go, before more bandits or Apaches come!), Jimena informs proceeding to grab whatever undamaged supplies she could. The whole time she refused to look at Camilla and deliberately cover her arm and chest"¡Madre! Madre, por favor, dime qué pasa!(Mother! Mother, please, just tell me what's wrong!), Teen Camilla calls as the world around Caleb distorts again. He's bombarded with images of the days that followed since that incident with the bandits. In that time, Camilla mother had become noticeably more distant towards. Though she assured Camilla all was well, the latter knew her mother was indeed hiding a secret. It hurt Teen Camilla even more noticing how she even LOOKED at Teen Camilla differently since then. Teen Camilla herself surprised by her 'transformation'. However, she couldn't deny the rush and...excitement she felt killing those men. She had never felt so powerful, in control, free even. However, she decided she'd only channel that side of herself to protect her mother. That is until...The world around Caleb dissolves again this time he's transported to the inside of a small damaged house. Apparently, it had been raided in an attack by Apache with the inhabitants killed much to Camilla's and her mother's fortune as they now had an actual bed to sleep in.Caleb notices Teen Camilla sitting up from the old fashioned bed stretching herself out. She then looks behind her surprised to see her mother not lying beside her anymore. She raises in eyebrow guessing she was already up. She puts on a brown cloak covering her wings and horns then exits the room."Madre.", Teen Camilla calls out only to get no response. She listens closely with her sensitive ears getting no signs of life in the house. She figures maybe she's outside the house maybe picking out whatever livestock that's left to eat. She opens the front door and goes outside. Caleb is immediately taken aback upon seeing two people, a man and a woman, lying dead on the ground their bodies little with arrows sticking out their bodies. He was even more shocked seeing Camilla just casually steps over the wife's body."¡Madre! (Mother!), Teen Camilla calls out a bit louder still getting no response. She feels her heart starting to race before quickly going back inside frantically searching the entire for any sign of her mother. She finds one of the canteens missing along with some of the rations they stole from a U.S. caravan. However, what really caught her eye was the necklace she made for her mother lying on the kitchen table. She gingerly picks it up immediately going into panic mode as Caleb watches feeling especially bad for her. She runs out of the house, clutching the necklace, leaving the small settlement frantically looking around the vast open rocky plains with shadbushes and sages grasses."Madre donde esta?! Mother!( Mother, where are you?! Mother), Camilla screams getting no response. Nothing.She then spent the next three hours searching desperately for her mother. To no avail.Camilla could be seen returning to the small farmhouse once again stepping over the remains of the inhabitants. She walks inside going to the bed and sitting down on the bed. She clutches her mom's necklace to her chest proceeding to sob lowly as tears trailed her cheeks. Caleb watches feeling every emotion she was feeling. Confusion. Fear. Guilt. Sorrow. Where was her mother? Why would she go anywhere without telling her?She was broken out off her thought upon hearing horses galloping coming closer and closer to the farm. She goes to one of the windows able to make out what looks to be a some Apache warriors approaching the farm. She frantically glances around before hiding under the bed.The sound of the back door being forced open followed by audible thuds and footsteps could be heard. She could hear them talking, speaking their tribal language which she could not understand. She could hear them opening and closing stuff, throwing things around, or ripping things off surfaces. She didn't know why they came back despite having already stolen or killed most of the livestock and killing the inhabitants but she assumed they were looking for other things to trade or sell for more guns and ammunition.One of them enters the bedroom, going through the drawers and closet. She covers her mouth stifling her voice seeing his deer skin boots and pants quickly moving around the room. He calls out to his cohorts from the other room as Camilla could sense him ripping the blankets from bed.Suddenly, he drops something metallic on the floor startling Camilla. It was a canteen landing in front of Camilla. Her eyes widen seeing the carved magic symbols on it instantly recognizing it as her MOTHER'S canteen. Why did THIS man have her canteen?! She digs her claws into the wooden floor glaring at the canteen intently as a red aura began to swirl around her body. A small red magic seal forming in her palm.The Apache man curiously notices the strange light emanating from under the bed. He carefully reachs grabbing the beds lower edge. He quickly lifts it up and Camilla launches a small blast of red energy at his larynx searing his vocal cords."AGHH!", the man elicits audibly while lunging backwards knocking down the open dresser drawers and nightstand before falling to the floor writhing and clenching his throat in pain. He picks himself up enough looking to see Camilla. A look of panic crosses his face upon see the demoness. Camilla takes the metal canteen and bashing him on the head as hard as she could as he falls to ground dead from hemorrhaging.As he lay unconcious, Camilla gives a cold glare before looking at the canteen with her mother's inscriptions on it."Haskįįyįį! Ndeeń!", she heard one of the other Apache call out footsteps audibly thumbing towards the bedroom. Camilla lunges herself up with a flap of her wings to the upper corner of the ceiling just behind the door then holding herself in place.The two men entire the room surprised to see their comrade dead body with a bloody wound on his head. While they were distracted, Camilla creates a red magic seal on the back of one of them. They scream out in intense pain as red lightning pulsates from the body then falling to the floor convulsing violently. The last one turns around taking out his knife to combat the assailant. He freezes in shock at the demonic woman on the ceiling.Camilla fires a blue energy blast directly into the Apache man's head leaving a searing hole in his face as he collapses next to his other dead comrade. Camilla turns to the one still convulsing the floor with red lightning illuminating and eyes widen and red to bursting as he forms at the mouth. Camilla releases the seals effects on him as he coughs frantically now able to breath.She grabs him by the collar and throws him against the wall sitting him up. Getting a good look at him, Caleb notice the man couldn't be no more than nineteen or twenty."¿De dónde has sacado esto? ...¡¿De dónde has sacado esto?!(Where did you get this? ...Where did you get this?!)", Camilla demanded showing him the canteen. The man trembles still regaining his bearings he then nervously makes hands gestures.From what she could make out, he says he found it floating the river two miles east of the farm. Camilla glares at him with demonic red eyes. She touches his chest creating an orange magic seal on his chest. She makes a gesture saying "don't move" before leaving out the room grabbing her cloak with the canteen at her side.She finds the horse the Apache used waiting outside. They begin to freak as she appoaches. She then waves her finger in a circle motion, eyes glowing brightly, as the horse begin to fall under a hypnotic trance. Two of the horse turn and gallop away as she mounts the one left behind."AGhhhhhhhh!", screamed the Apache man from inside the house and flicking red light could be seen from the window. Camilla simply shakes her head before commanding the force to gallop towards the direction of the river.'No sé dónde ni por qué dejaste a mamá ... ¡pero te prometo que te encontraré! Cualquiera que se interponga en mi camino ... lo mataré. ¡Los mataré a todos!(I don't know where or why you left mother...but I promise I'll find you! We're all we have right?! I don't care who stands in my way...i'll kill them. I'll kill them all!), Camilla thought venomously while clenching her mother's beaded necklace.The surrounding begin to dissolve and change again as Caleb feels every nerve in his being getting a surge of emotions overwhelming his senses.He is then bombarded with visions and memories of Camilla's solo crusade to find her mother. He saw images of demoness surviving on her own while looking for clues to lead to finding her. In her pursuit, she'd come across whatever unfortunate soul bold or stupid enough to harass her.Apparently, the incident with the bandits and the Apaches at the farm house awakened something dark within Camilla. Rather than continue to run and hide from the humans, she decided THEY were the ones who should be afraid. THEY were the ones that should hide. She has the power and she was going to use it.What follows are a collection of scenes bombarded Caleb's vision. All of them featuring the demoness rip, cut, dismember, crush, decapitate, and eviscerate any human and sometimes liminal that crossed her path.There was one scene in late evening where a bunch of U.S. calvary soldiers sitting around their camp with some counting up the scalps they took off the Comanche warriors they killed today. Suddenly, one of the soldiers wordlessly stands up as if under a trance before shoot and killing several of his comrades before being killed by the leader. Then the leader falls under a trance and turns and shoots more of her own men before a few soldiers restrain him. At that moment, the other soldiers scream in terror along with choked gargling as they all drop to the ground their throats sliced open squirting blood all over each other. The soldiers restraining the leader look on in horror and confusion. Then small green magic seals form near each of their necks before slicing deeply through their neck splurting their blood all over their leader as they gargle inarticulately before collapsing to the ground dropping dead or going into shock. Around that time, the leader snaps out of his trance and notices, to his horror, his camp burning, his men all dead, and a hooded figure approaching him staring with demonic red eyes. Out of panic, he pulls for a nearby handgun and immediately drops it wailing in agony as his fingers are sliced off by a green magic seal. He cradles his hand as the figure stared him down carrying dufflebag of supplies. It then a small sac full of Comanche at him before creating a green magic seal on his crotch."Entonces, te gustan las niñas pequeñas, ¿eh?(So, you like little girls huh?), it spoke glancing to the dead teenage Comanche girl inside his tent.He begs the figure before screaming in agony having his genital brutally sliced to pieces as the figure smiles.Caleb recoils wanting to throw up not wanting to see any more. To his dismay, he's then greeted with another scene.This time of a younger Camilla stopping to rest a small stream wanting to take a quick bath. She pulls off her worn down sandals before exposing her shapely legs dipping her feet in the cool waters. She sighs in relief preparing to fully disrobe before stopping upon hearing footsteps behind her. She turns her head seeing four Mexican soldiers approaching her with lecherous grins. The most handsome-looking one comes up attempting to coerce her into their 'protection' as 'murderer' has been killing 'indians, Mexicans and U.S. soldiers, travelers, even bandits'. She quite rudely rebuffs him even spitting in his face as his comrades laugh at him. He wipes his face before speaking politely again while stifling his anger inviting a beautiful flower like her to come with them. Or else. Camilla sees him pulling his gun from his holster as the other men close in on her boxing her in. Camilla sighs removing her legs from the water covering herself again.She shoots a red glowing glare at the handsome thug putting him under a hypnotic trance. He then gun out, opens his mouth, shoves the barrel down to the back of throat as his men squawk in confusion before spraying his brains all over the lush green grass before His body drops dead beside an indifferent Camilla. The other men scream in horror, shock, and confusion seeing their leader spontaneously committed suicide. Camilla rises up slowly turning toward the men. She creates two black magic seals on three of their chests. They look down in surprise before an huge black bristled spike fires from the seal impaling through their chests. Another spike shoots up from through their throats out the tops of their heads before a more spikes shoot out from everywhere orifice on their face. They each drop dead to the ground as the spikes disappear leaving behind massive vacant holes through their bodies. The last remaining man scream to the top of his lungs before Camilla silence him putting him under a trance not wanting him to alert more soldiers. She brings him to his knees muttering unintelligible gasps."Estabas interrumpiendo mi baño. ¿Y sabes qué más? Ese 'asesino' que mencionó ... Creo que solo se están deshaciendo de la basura.(You were interrupting my bath. And you know what else? That 'murderer' he mentioned...I think they're just getting rid of trash.), Camilla spoke removing her hood exposing her demonic features and flowing brown hair. The man tried to scream in terror only utter gargled muffled before Camilla taps his head forming a red magic seal on his forehead. She turns walking back to the river as the man's head in engulfed in hellish flames burning him down to the skull. His screams of agony fall on deaf ears as Camilla resumes her bath. She notices the blood on her hands and part of her skirt and attempts to wash it off.Caleb is left feeling from the scene unable to believe this what Camilla was like. He's then bombarded my more scenes like this.This continued for years and in that time Camilla had grown more used to this lifestyle filled with bloodshed and manipulation; even at times actually ENJOYING killing these worthless humans. Overtime, she had built up a reputation from whatever few survivors around the country as La diablesa de Chihuahua(The She-Devil of Chihuahua). With every scene, the screams, the smell of blood and burning bodies, consumed Caleb's sense."Oh god make it stop! MAKE IT STOP! I DON'T WANNA SEE ANY MORE! LET ME OUUUT! !", Caleb screams as a purple aura surrounds his body distorting the world around him in to purple aurora-like hue.He's then greeted by scenes with Camilla all alone with a somber, depressed look. She continued traveling, still in search of her mother, not wanting to lose hope, but never finding more clues. Every night, she'd lay awake thinking of her, wondering what she did wrong? Caleb could feel the sadness and loneliness she felt on those days where she was forced to sit alone in relative silence just thinking to herself. Unsure if her mother even WANTS to see HER. The only really thing really keeping her together was to necklace she made for her mother which she clenched every night before falling asleep seeing it as her only connection to her mother. Caleb looks on feeling the pain she felt. He fought back his tears as short visions of his own mom flash around him.As more seems play out showing Camilla's journey through the decades; eventually looking more like a woman in her twenties. The wars eventually came to an end with the country succeeding independence to the U.S. before slowly rebuilding it's infrastructure. Camilla learn many of the surviving Apache and Comanche human tribes had been relocated and confined to settlements by the humans in America; a fact she always thought didn't make alot of sense. Over the decades, human technology drastically changed around her. From the adoption of railroads and trains, farming machines, and little boxes with human voices inside called 'radios'. Not to mention, the automobiles! The machines humans now ride in that's basically a faster horse they don't have to feed. All that and more was enough to make her head spin.This new era since the war's ending, and with her reputation still plaguing Mexican civilians, meant Camilla was in less danger of being discovered. She hadn't had to bloody her hands for quite some time save for the unfortunate, foolish human she'd hypnotically control into leaving her alone. Unfortunately, around this time, Angels had begun flooding into the country subtly influencing and assisting the humans of faith to create more territories in the country. This also meant hunting down and attacking any Devil clans that could be found. It wasn't long before Camilla, given her past reputation, attracted their attention.The world around Caleb distorted again. He now finds himself standing outside again at night in the Mexican dessert surrounded cacti and other desert plants. The light of the halfmoon illuminating his view. It was a fairly quite and serene atmosphere...except...Camilla zooms past Caleb to his surprise before he's dragged along in the scene. She sprints at top speed wings tucked into her back( Naruto run) before creating creating a red magic seal then shooting a fireball behind her. Caleb looks up see who she was firing it at shocked to see five Angels wearing Roman-style robes and armor flying behind her. They dodge her attack before two of them create yellow magic seals firing yellow energy balls at her. She turns around deflecting the attacks with two large red magic seal before exploding with impact to the ground. She flaps her wings launching herself in the air levitating in place."Surrender Devil! Your savagery and wickedness upon these children of God ends tonight!", stated the male Angel in the silver chest armor drawing a glowing sword at her. Caleb was surprised he was speaking English, aside from the notable European accent."Parece que estás ansiosa por ser la primera en morir !(It seems you're eager to be the first to die!), Camilla spat back not really understanding a word the Angel said before firing a spray red lightning at the group making them scramble."DIE YOU VILLAIN!", screamed a female Angel in bronze armor rocketing toward Camilla from the side ready to impale her with a spear of yellow energy. Camilla dodges before firing a beam of red energy slicing diagonally bisecting her body. She screams in agony as both halves of her body fall to the ground."ELPHELT!", one of the other male Angels in bronze armor screams before charging Camilla with a battle cry conjuring a glowing axe. She dodges his swing before delivering a hard kick to his jaw sending to ground with a crash.Camilla takes the opportunity to charge up her aura then rocketing away as fast as she could before her energy gives out with the remaining Angels in pursuit. She tries to lose them among a rocky plateau."HAULT! PAY FOR YOUR CRIMES DEMON!", The Angel in silver armor shouted angrily in anguish over his fallen comrades. His glowing sword morphs into a bow and arrow. He takes aim and fires."Aaaaaghhhh!", Camilla screams as the arrow pierces her. She tumbles down the side of the rocky plateau landing in the dirt coughing and holding her bleeding side. She stumbles picking f up and she quickly limps away. Suddenly, a yellow energy blast grazes her burning her arm exploding sending dust flying in her eyes. She then trips tumbling down a small trench. Camilla struggles to pick herself up."Gahhhhhhh!", Camilla screams as her body is illuminated in yellow lightning. Caleb recoils in shock at seeing her in such pain. She falls to her side cringing in pain before seeing the silver armor Angel landing standing above her with his two subordinates joining her. Camilla glares at him creating a black magic seal above him only to destroy it with a slash of his glowing sword.He descends downward standing over her with his sword drawn."Your time has come Devil. No longer will you plague this land with your evil. May you pay your debts with your flesh.", He say raising his sword ready to thrust downwards. Camilla gives an indifferent look closing her eyes accepting her fate.*ZAP*Instead of a sword to the chest, she's greeted by the distinct sound of an attack spell and the feeling of something warm against her leg. She looks up to see the silver armor Angel choking on his own blood with a large open wound through his chest before a beam of blue energy fires through his head. The other two Angels shout in surprise before each receiving a death beam to the head as well. All three Angels collapse dead to Camilla confusion but relief."Hey! Are you alright?! Hey, stay with me!", called an unknown voice as Camilla fall unconcious. The world around Caleb falls into darkness.Caleb goes silent awaiting whatever was to come. The world around him changes again as he sees things from Camilla perspective again. Camilla awakens finding herself lying in a twin bed then around at the contemporary style room with small open window shining light in the bedroom. Camilla pushes herself up in a sitting position curiously looking around before notice her wound had been bandaged and treatedThe door of the bedroom opens and in steps a Devil woman wearing a blue thigh cut dress skirt and matching dress shirt. She had a fair complexion, long silver-black hair, two large horns, black wings with silver outlines, and silver tipped slender black tail. She notices Camilla and beams a warm smile at her."You're awake! Thank Discord I was so worried.", the strange Devil woman spoke happily before taking a chair next to her bed, "I'm glad I arrived before those filthy could kill you. Oh! It looks like your wounds have healed nicely from those magic attacks."Camilla tilts her head in confusion, "Que(What?)""Oh right, this is before she could speak English.", Caleb says to himself."Oh...I guess you can't understand me huh?", the silver haired Devil woman spoke.The door of the room opens again and a short tan devil girl steps in wearing a small polka dot dress."Is she awake yet?", she inquires."Oh, hi Ursula, yes she is awake. But...""¿Dónde estoy? ¿Como llegué aqui? ¿Quienes son ustedes?(Where am I? How did I get here? Who ARE you people?), Camilla demanded."Oh, perdónanos, mi nombre es Ursula y ella es Nadia. Ella te salvó de esos Ángeles(Oh, forgive us, my name is Ursula and this is Nadia. She saved you from those Angels), Ursula answered as Camilla gives her a puzzled look."I didn't know you spoke Spanish Ursula.", Nadia stated in surprise."I grew up in Tiawana remember?", Ursula answered incredulously."Oh yeahhhh, well can you ask her her name?""Si no le importa, nos encantaría saber su nombre.(If you don't mind, we'd love to know your name.), Ursula translated.Camilla looks between them before answering, "Camilla."Nadia eyes light up, "Such a beautiful name! I think it means "noble" in Latin. I'm kind of a bookworm.", she finished bashfully as Camilla gives her confused look before Ursula quickly translates."By the way, that's really pretty necklace.", Nadia gestures to her neck as Camilla gingerly touches her necklace. She then clenches her neck turning away a shooting a warning glare at Nadia, "Oh Nonononono I don't want it! I just-""Oh! Nadia we have to introduce to everyone else!", Ursula stated.Nadia gives a surprised, "Ah! Your right! Our lord has to meet her as well!", She says before hastily grabbing some clothing from a nearby closet then laying them as the foot of the bed, "Put these. Quickly. No offense, but...your clothes look a bit...ragged.", she says noting Camilla's dirty worn out clothing.Ursula quickly translated before Camilla shoots the silver-haired Devil an insulted glare."You didn't to translate that!""Yes I did.", Ursula affirmed.The scene changes again. This showing Camilla in her new clothes consisting on red form fitting vinyl pants with matching keyhole top( a very 60s outfit). He then sees Camilla being introduced to dozens of other Devils as Nadia explains what happened. From what he could gather, Nadia brought Camilla back to her clan after killing the Angels that were hunting her. There were also several others just like Camilla situation that they've taken in as part of their clan. They even explained how this place they were living is in a large mansion in California just close to the border of Mexico that used to belong to some rich humans who all died "mysteriously" leaving their estate unsupervised until THEY fixed it up. They sold off some of the jewelry, fine art, and other treasures in the nearby human city for money for food and supplies. They obtaining water through a pre-built pump connected to a nearby river and generated their own electricity using simple spells.Camilla is then lined up along with several other Devil women that were given refuge in along the large doors of a bed chamber. She has an annoyed scowl after having been informed by Ursula that their 'Lord' was going to 'inspect' the new faces. The doors of the bed chamber opens and out steps a fair-skinned Devil Man. He had a muscular physique complete with washboard abs, several demonic symbols tattooed on body, and a goatee.. He wore nothing but pair of black boxer briefs, black robe with inside gold lining, and wear gold chain around his neck while puffing a large Cuban cigar. Five Devil women exit his bed chamber he heartily slaps each of their butts as the pass."Alright, where's the new batch of bitches at?", He stated in a pompous tone puffing his chest out.Caleb recoils frowning in dread at the total douche before him, "Ohhhh no.""R-Right here my lord!", Ursula spoke up gesturing to the line of girls, "These poor souls are the survivors of the many frequent Angel attacks recently and humbling request-""Boring! Shut up! Let me work.", The Devil Man silences her as he struts around looking each of the women judging each of them. He goes up to tan-skinned peach haired Devil, "What's your name sweetheart?""H-Harl-""Changed my mind, don't care! Spin around.", The Douche Devil Man cuts her off as she does as instructed. He nods approvingly at her peach shaped butt and shapely legs but seemingly disappointed in her lackluster C-cups, "Alright, you're in the 'Peach group' ", he stated pointing to the group of several Devil women with a similar body type. She reluctantly goes over to join them.He goes to the next lady, a blue-skinned Greater Devil with lavender hair and freckles, "What about you freckles? What's your story?""M-My sister and I escaped capture from a band of Arch Angels.", she says gesturing to her twin sister who sheepishly raises her hand.Douche Devil Man raises an eyebrow, "Twins huh? Hmm...why don't you two hug for a minute? Wanna see something."The two give confused looks to each other before reluctantly doing as instructed. The Devil Man watches nodding in satisfaction at the shapely apple butts and G-cups mushing into each other. He the walks up and grabs two handfuls of their luscious rears making them flinch at the sudden groping."Alright, you two in the 'Apricot group' ", he says slapping their butts then pointing to said group before the twins hastily go join them.This continues on for 10 minutes until he finally reaches Camilla who looks none too pleased to see him."Hmmm, well now, Discord sure did give you some assets. Looking like a whole fruit basket.", he says examining her thicc, curvaceous thighs, ample I-Cups and perfectly hourglass frame much to Camilla's revulsion, "Now you just hold still while I get a good look at ya.", He smirks reaching to her chin.Camilla quickly grabs his index finger snapping it like a twig much to Nadia's and the others shock.GAHHH! GUHH FUCKIN'! THE FUCKS WRONG WITH YOU?!", Douche Devil Man shouted recoiling back cradling his hand."Mantén tus dedos mugrientos para ti o los guardaré para ti ... como un collar.(Keep your grubby fingers to yourself or I'll keep them for you...as a necklace.), Camilla says in a venomous tone disturbing Ursula a bit.Douche Devil Man gives her a confused look, "What?! The fuck is that shit?! She can't even speak English?""Uh, no my lord. She's actually from Mexico. We just found her crossing the border after an Angel attack. Basically...she said don't touch her.", Ursups says"No shit idiot! Throw her out! I don't need any violent, bean breath bitches in my life!", Douche Devil Man stated pointing his now healed finger at Camilla. Camilla glared clenching her fists looking ready to kill a motherfucker before Ursula and Nadia step in."Wait my Lord!", Nadia started, "I'm sure she didn't mean to lash out at you like that. She's still dealing with her near death experience last night and...she's just stressed. Please, forgive Camilla.""Camilla? Is that her name? Sounds stupid. Like 'Camel' and 'vanilla' ", he replies shooting a look at the Elder Devil who glares at him."~Please my Lord?~", Nadia spoke fluttering her eyes and mushing her cleavage together.Douche Devil Man raises an eyebrow, "Ehhh...fine, whatever. But you two are in charge of educating the bitch how things work around here! Otherwise, you can drop her ass back to Taco Town. And teach her English dammit! She gonna live here she do like the rest and speak in language I can understand!", he demands"Yes, of course we will my Lord! You can count on us!", Ursula replies as her and Nadia bow to him to Camilla displeasure as she crosses her arms."Hm, ALRIGHT! Listen up all you day forward I, Victus D. Abbadeer, am your husband and you're my...whatever number wife! You will love, protect, and obey me in the name of chaos!", He stated in a prideful tone as Ursula translate for Camilla.Camilla turns her head huffing defiantly.Douche Devil Man scoffs turning to everyone else clapping his hands, "Alright, Alright! That's over with! Chores need to be done, my food needs to be cooked, and kids need to be made! *clap* Hop to it!"Nadia takes Camilla hand, "Come on, let's go."She and Nadia lead Camilla away as the Elder Devil looks back sneering resentful at the man who calls himself her husband.The world distorts around Caleb again."Ok, this getting old now.", Caleb complains as scenes of Camilla's life in Abbadickhead's clan flash by him. From what he could gather, Camilla, while hesitant, began to open up more to Nadia and Ursula. There were scenes showing the three of them together doing things. Ursula showing off her personal library where she would teach Camilla the English language. Luckily, Camilla was a pretty fast learner so It didn't take much time for her be speaking basic sentences. It was also here where Ursula introduced her to the insult to mystical arts that is the Harry Potter series. She and Nadia seemed to be the closest though as they'd spend time cooking, developing spells, practicing different martial arts from human books, or just spending time getting to know each other. It was thanks to the two that Camilla was able to adjust fairly quickly. In fact, the two seemed to be her only friends as the other Devil women were hesitant even afraid to come too close to Camilla. They seemed to be able to sense something wasn't right with her.It wasn't long before Camilla learned that her 'husband' was not only a pompous, childish dickhead. He enjoyed harassing and pulling cruel and harmful pranks on them; even if they were pregnant. He was frequently spiritual and verbally abusive toward the Devil women while constantly praying on their individual insecurities while sexually humiliating and abusing them. He'd especially enjoyed belittlIng and insulting Camilla because of her tenuous English-speaking skill and her Mexican heritage in general. He really enjoyed insulting her cooking and sub par housework calling her a failure as woman. He'd take any chance he could to grope and molest her much to her utter disgust. Several times Camilla would get pushed to far prepared to kill him...as slowly as possible. It was times like these Nadia was there to hold her back reminding Camilla of a male Devil importance to their species. Without him, they'd be discovered and quickly overwhelmed by Angels which frustrated Camilla even more as she's forced to tolerate this treatment.Then, came the day when it was Camilla's time to attempt to bear children.The world distorts around Caleb as he finds himself stand in a large bed chamber in the dead of night. Douche Devil Man lay on his back in his king size, peacock pattern blanket with seven half naked Devil women around his bed. The doors of the bed chamber open and Camilla slowly steps in wearing black stockings with lace black panties underneath and match bra. A cold, expression on her face as she looks back to Nadia was peaking through the door."Please...", she whispered in a pleading tone before Camilla closes her eyes in thought."We-hehehe-ellll, check out the Señorita!", Douche Devil Man chortled bringing Camilla out of her thoughts as she turns a cold gaze at him, "Bout time you came around. I just finished on each of these girls here but I think I got a little more baby gravy in the take tank for you. Now how about you get that latina ass over here while I'm still in the mood."Caleb gives a look like he's ready beat this guys ass. A sentiment he could feel Camilla felt in the moment. Camilla looks back to Nadia seeing her pleading eyes. She sighs to herself."As ju wish...ugh Darling", Camilla forces the words making her sick. She reluctantly walks over to the bed as two of the Devil women go to her side to her confusion. They begin to undress her before DDM stops them."Hold up!", He stands getting up in Camilla face with a lecherous smirk, "More fun if I do this one myself. Put her on the bed and hold her arms down. Don't need her Trying to break anything else on me."The two Devil women seize Camilla by the arms as she struggles a bit as they lay her on the bed pressing their bodyweight against her. Camilla protests before one on them whispers in her ear."It's ok. It'll be over soon, just let it happen and it'll be over quickly.", she assured.DDM grabs a caresses up and down Camilla thighs before forcefully spreading them open. He rips the tights around her crotch allow acces to the lace black panties which he pushes out of the way exposing her pussy. Camilla looks down with sheer hatred in hers eyes as he oggles her womanhood."Yeah, you ready for it? You ready for some of this Chica?", he emphasizes taking his foot long erection in hand. Camilla clenches her teeth in frustration as Caleb looks away not wanting to see that. He then jams his thumb into her opening making wretch at the sudden intrusion. He then sticks his middle finger up her anus making Camilla gasp wriggling in protest. He grin in satisfaction, "Yeah you like that? This getting you in the mood now.He releases his fingers climbs over her body coming face to face. He licks her neck up to her cheek, pushes her bra up allowing her mountainous tits to flop freely, then he aligns himself over her opening before thrusting himself into her."Ghaaa!", Camilla exclaims in from pain having her hymen broken. She violently thrashed as other Devil women restrain her movements DDM ignores her continuing to thrust in and out using her blood as some kind of lubricant."Fuckin hell! YOU'RE a virgin?! Hahahaha this is just too perfect! How's you're first cock taste Senorita? Cuz this pussy nice and tight! Hnnnghh!", He grunts pounding her harder before grabbing her tits squeezing them hard causing her to exclaim in protest.Camilla clenches her eyes biting her to the point of lip drawing blood before turning away not wanting to give him the satisfaction of her discomfort."Haha! This is great! Best part is your lucky number 69! I'm gonna get you GOOD and pregnant! WOOOOHAHAHA!", DDM hooted loudly thrusting harder and faster creating loud sloshing from her blood and juices.Caleb covers his eyes hating every second of the scene as he could also sense Camilla's pain. She didn't want to this bastards child! She hated the very idea of it. She hated everything about her life right now. She just wanted this whole experience to be over already. Then she thought of her mother. She wondered if...THIS is what she went through when conceiving her?! She remembers the woeful expression on her face whenever she ask about the day she was born. The thought alone hurt her more than this bastard.The scene around Caleb changes this time showing the aftermath of Camilla's night with DDM. She sat outside on the balcony on the floor huddled with her knees to her chest. Nadia appears before sitting next to her then notices the blood stain near the opening of Camilla thighs. She touches Camilla shoulder to comfort her only Camilla to jerk away shooting a glare at her. Nadia gives retracts giving a look of understanding. Camilla frowns slightly then hides her face in her knees. The two if them sit in silence neither of them wanting to say a word.The scenery dissolves as more images of Camilla's time in DDM clan. There were several dedicated to her growing camaraderie with Nadia and Ursula but also her deepening hatred towards DDM. It wasn't long before she did in fact become pregnant. However...Caleb is suddenly transported into another memory. This time he's standing behind Camilla with Nadia and Ursula on either side of appearing to be comforting her. They were standing in front of a small perfectly rectangular hole in the ground as Camilla held a large blue blanket. He could see the deeply hurt look on Camilla's face as her lip quivered. Caleb steps to get a better look. Curiosity was replaced by shock and horror upon seeing the bloody, underdeveloped lifeless Devil baby fetus barely any bigger than his hand."Oh...Oh my god...", was all Caleb could utter as he steps away. Camilla kneels down placing the remains of her child in the small grave before slowly raising up. Ursula creates a small yellow magic seal as dirt convers up the hole in a neat oval pile then burning a pentagram in the upper part of the grave."You did good. It made it 6 months. That's...longer than most of us get.", Nadia tries to assure before giving a somber look touching her own stomach. Camilla eyes widen."She's right. Don't feel bad. You're not alone.", Ursula assures.Camilla looks down at her child's grave before raising her head. Then, to Caleb's shock, the scene expanded showing dozen perhaps HUNDREDS of small graves with similar pentagram around them stretch at least 50 yards of California desert. Camilla wipes a tear from her eye as Nadia and Ursula console her.The scenes dissolves being replaced by more scenes of Camilla's life. Her first miscarriage had quite the affect on her. Despite hating him with all her being, she had become indifferent to sex with DDM for procreation purposes. Several scenes play out in front of Caleb where DDM energetically had sex with her while Camilla wore a blank, emotionless expression; treating it as a chore. The scenes that follow show more Camilla's failed attempts at conceiving along with other Devil women burying their stillborn as well. Nadia and Ursula would comfort her in these times. The two continued to be her only true companions throughout her time in the clan to the point where Camilla eventually opened up enough to tell them the story of her previous clan, her mother, and her how she lost her. They were shocked but understood her struggle and didn't hold her actions against her.The scene transition to three decades later. Camilla looks more like her present day self. The world has changed astronomically. Human innovation, technology, politics, and society as a whole rapidly advanced faster than many of Devils thought possible. However, the most alarming news was the human government announced to the public that non-human species like Camilla's actually existed and they were working on 'integrating' species like hers; which they called 'Liminals'. Personally, Camilla wasn't interesting in the humans pitiful attempts to get attention from people like her. If they choose to lump her in with other species under ONE derogatory name, clearly they don't have their best intentions in mind.She and the rest of the clan were facing their own issues anyway. Over time, the treasures and trinkets they sold to obtain the food and supplies they needed became scarcer and scarcer. Coupled with the human's changing market values and technology that haven't adapted to yet only made it harder for them. They hunted some of their food but hare and desert snakes could only feed so many of them. Suddenly, large sums of money started pouring in to which most of the resources went to Abbadickhead and anyone he chose to share the spoils with. This, of course, led to some resentment among the Devil women. However, what was more alarming to Camilla but especially Nadia were the sudden disappearances of some of their clan members. Particularly, Ursula who they hadn't seen in two weeks since her night with Abbadickhead. When questioned, he just dodged the question and his subordinates he'd been spoiling blocked them from continuing further. Nadia and Camilla decided to stay on high alert since then."Wahhhh!", Caleb exclaims as he's pulled into another scene with Camilla and Nadia at banquet table with the other Devil women. A spread of different food from roasted hare or venizen and homemade drinks and bread. Abbadickhead sat at the head of the table with his small posé of Devil women surrounded by a wider variety of food from roast chicken and duck, cooked veggies, fine wines, even desserts like cake and pies. He greedily helps himself as his subordinates enjoy themselves as well. Nadia, Camilla, and some of the others glare at the group with contempt as a few of his subordinates shoot them snide looks.After dinner was over, Camilla and Nadia begun packing up all the dishes along with the others. They all were on cleanup duty...again."HEY, Chica!", Abbadickhead calls out to Camilla getting her attention, "Join me in the chamber with the rest!"Camilla gives a questioning look to Nadia who shrugs before taking Camilla's stack of dishes for her."Go on, I'll see you later.", Nadia assures giving her a grin."HEY! YOU understand English now right?! Right-o this way-o to have sex-o! Rapido! Rapido!", he chides clapping his hands together.Camilla gives an exasperated sigh, "Jes."She follows him and his subordinates into the bed chamber. As the doors close behind them, she glances back to Nadia who was helping the others with their dishes and grins to herself.In the bed chamber, six of his subordinates stood at different parts of the room watching her. Despite this being routine for her, this time, for some reason, something just didn't seem right."Alright Chica, you know the drill. Wall today.", Abbadickhead unhooked his belt letting his pants drop to the floor. Camilla rolls her eyes unzipping her dress skirt pulling them and her panties to the floor leaving her entire lower half naked to the world. Caleb looks away shamefully as she presses her hands against showing her bare pussy to Abbadickhead; a cold, emotionless look on her face all the while.Abbadickhead presses himself against her back and begins pawing at her privates causing her to shift in discomfort."Yeah, you love this position huh?", He whispers lecherously."Just get it over with.", Camilla retorts plainly."Hoho, eager to start I see! Alright, it's daddy dicking time.", He chuckles as Camilla rolls her eyes swearing under her breath in her native tongue. However, instead of him shoving his disgusting thing inside of her, she feels something sharp prick into her neck."GAHH!", She elicits pushing him off her holding her neck. She sees Abbadickhead smirking while holding a syringe, her vision becomes blurry as her body feel like it's being weighed down. She starts to stumble about before two of his subordinate Devil women grab under her arms holding her up. The world around Caleb become warpy like he just took a hit of acid."Heh, I wasn't sure if the usual dosage would be enough for a frisky girl like you so I just mixed in a few other things. Those humans can sure make some drugs.", He spoke his voice sounded distorted to her. He then reaches for her neck and rips off her mother's necklace much to her horror, "Let me just get that outta the way", he tosses it to one of his subordinates."N-Nuhhh...Nuh...", Camilla tries to scream out coming out as tired murmurs before he head drops as she loses consciousness. The would around Caleb going black."Y...ah, sh...bring...n...od...money.", said the distorted voice of Abbadickhead as it fades out leaving Caleb in total darkness again. Unease swept throughout his being as he tried to come to terms with what he witnessed.Suddenly, the world distorts as light fills the areas. Camilla was awakening from her deep slumber immediately greeted by a pounding headache and an unrelenting muggy smell in the air. She raises up her hands to massage it away only to find her hands and feet bound together by cuff and chains much to her surprise. She looks around at the unfamiliar area finally noticing the steel partially rusted bars, solid brick wall and floor, and the dirty small mattress was lying on with bucket of water next to it. She was in some sort of prison cell and apparently she wasn't the only one. Before her were several more cells to her left and right. Straight ahead was a small metal staircase going up to a large metallic door. It was dimly lit with three flickering fluorescent lights on the cieling. She could make out different women non-human women with canines, feline, or other mammalian features and even some species she actually recognized like Echidna, harpies, and even a few Greater Devils all packed up in their cells like livestock. The sound of their whimpering and murmurs could be heard. Camilla and Caleb could also see children cuddled up to their mothers crying. Caleb's heart sinks into his stomach at the sight. Camilla then notices the metal collar around her neck. She second she touches her fingers to it she gets a painful spark to her hand."Ack! Que(what)?!", she exclaims.*Buzz*The metallic door buzzes with a green light glowing near the handle before swinging open. Six men step inside; some of them wearing casual outfits like jeans and white tanks and carrying with looked like bags of different foods. As they approach the cells, several of the prisoners reach their hands through the bars desperately trying to grab whatever food the men handed out. Mothers scrambling the hardest to get whatever they could for their child.One of the men approaches Camilla's cell. He was a fairly tall, wearing beige pants, brown leather shoes, dark green button up dress shirt with beige suit jacket an beige tie. He had black wavy hair, neatly trimmed beard and wore black aviator shades."Ahh, looks like our newest guest is awake.", he says as Camilla narrows her eyes at him,"Where am I human?", Camilla demanded"Well to put it bluntly you're currently my property. Ju may call me Alejandro.", he says in a weirdly comfortable tone, "Seems like ju creatures have become really popular lately. And it seems your parts sell highly on the overseas black markets. Now, I'm more in the drug business but I'm also dabbling in the business of creatures like ju. Gringos sell them to buyers like me and I sell the parts at better offers. That husband of yours is one of my best sellers. He sells me girls like ju that, and I quote, 'really suck at making kids'. ""W-What?!", Camilla replied incredulously, "So what? Are ju going to harvest me or something?""Ju?! In particular?! No no, those wings and horns fetch good money sure, but you're species has far more...substantial qualities.", He spoke looking her up and down. Camilla glares hatefully at him, "That's a scary face. I suggest ju behave. Otherwise I may take you up on that harvest proposal. ", he says pulling out a large hunting knife."Pedazo mierda(Piece of shit)! AS IF I'D SIT HERE AND LET JU!", Camilla shouted angrily getting to her feet then creating a large red above him. Suddenly, the collar on her neck begins to glow with bright Hebrew-style ruins."AAAAGGHHHH!", Camilla screams in agony as her body is engulfed in yellow rippling lightning and the magic seal disappears. She collapses to her knees cringing uncontrollaby and gagging."Hahahahaha Maldita sea(goddamn), these things actually work! Consider that a lesson Señora. Believe it or not, that collar is imbued with Angel magic! We bought them from a REAL Angel! Ah what a time to be alive!", Alejandro laughs heartily as Camilla cringes looking up at him."It definitely makes it easier to control you monsters!", He stated making sure the others were listening. Camilla finally notices all the other female species had some variant of the collar around their neck."Ju...hahhh...ju think these bars will keep in here? I'LL RIP JU APART WITH MY BAR-ARGHHH!", Camilla shouted grabbing the bars trying bend them apart but fails to her shock before collapsing on the floor with a loud scream her body convulsing violently."Of course, it's always good to have extra insurance.", Alejandro spoke holding a small black remote then points to the black collar on her ankle sending another set of jolts through her body. She spasms and foams at the mouth slightly."¡Jefe! ¡Los compradores están aquí!(Boss! The buyers are here!), one of the men stated."Ah, justo a tiempo. Déjalos entrar, diles que estaré allí en un minuto.(Ah, right on time. Let them in, tell them I'll be there in a minute.), Alejandro answered as the guy does as instructed. He then turns to Camilla lighting up a cigarette, "Sentirse cómodo. Estarás aquí un rato(Sentirse cómodo. Estarás aquí un rato).He walks away leaving. The audible sound of the metallic door slamming ringing throughout the room.Camilla weakly picks herself up leaning her back against the wall as she catches her breath. She experimentally forms a tiny blue magic seal on the tip of her finger and she's zapped again by golden electric sparks as the seal flickers out. It didn't hurt as much like before so she figured the stronger the spell the more pain it'll deliver. She picks herself up again before her legs give and she falls hard on her knees. She grunts in pain at her then reposition herself seeing her bleeding kneecaps and feeling the sting with every suddle movement. Her eyes widen realizing she isn't healing. Do these collars nullify her healing as well? Not only that, it feels like her physical strength is waning as well. She slumps against the wall staring up at the ceiling. Her mind processing her situation before turning to Nadia and Ursula wondering if they were ok. She grips her claws to the solid floor her mind now furiously turning to the reason she was here; Abbadickhead. She should have butchered him when she had the chance. Her eyes widen remembering one other detail before losing consciousness.She paws under the collar trying to feel if it was still there. A look of great sadness spreads across her face."No...no...no no no...", Camilla repeats upon realizing the last piece of her mother was gone. Tears build in her eyes as she wails in despair, "NOOOOOOOOOO!"Every emotion she felt in this moment overcomes Caleb senses as tears begin to build in HIS eyes. The scene dissolves as Caleb is now bombarded with memories of Camilla time in what she eventually learned is a drug and liminal trafficking cartel. She'd be forced to watch women and young men of different species being brought in or sold off. Children were forcefully separated from their mothers and sold to buyers looking for 'pets'. Species like Camilla's were sold buyers in the 'entertainment' industry. Those that were brought in for their parts were dragged out of their cells before being injected with some type of syringe then getting hauled off to another. Camilla could hear their anguished screams along with cutting and slicing noises followed by an audible gunshot. Then there were those like the lizard women or bird girl species that were horribly dismembered losing wholes tails or having their feathers and scales peeled clean from their bodies were brought back to their cells to allow parts to regrow before next harvest.They tried to sell Camilla multiple times but her violent temperament made it difficult to hold any buyers interest leading to Alejandro to punish her by having her go without food, water, or proper excretion. To her shame, there were days where she was forced to go in the corner like an animal. Everyday she grew weaker more powerless. Unable to do anything but sit in her tiny cell and think. She thought of many things. Nadia, Ursula, her life before meeting them, but most of all she thought of her mother and how she longed to hear her voice again; even if she hated her now or it's just a single phase. She needed it. Caleb's heart wrenches feeling her sadness.Suddenly, Caleb is dragged into another memory. This time time he could see Camilla strung up to the ceiling by her cuffs her head draped down with her outgrown hair her face. She wore some black yoga pants with dirty light blue dress shirt with a few buttons exposing her chest(it would be too tight otherwise). He then notices the cloth tied around her mouth. Apparently, she was on punishment for lashing out and biting off a buyer's finger. The door to her cell opens and one of the cartel guys wearing baggy camo pants and black v-neck steps inside hold a white grocery and a drink cup with a straw. Camilla lifts up her head glaring hatefully at the man.Oye, oye, tranquilo. El jefe dice que has sido un buen demonio estos últimos días, así que consigues algo de comida.(Hey hey, easy. The boss says you've been a good little demon these past couple days so you get some food.), he says before reaching up and hooking the cloth around her mouth, "Me voy a quitar esto. ¡Compórtate ahora! Bien...( I'm gonna take this off. Behave now! Alright...)Camilla remained silent allowing him to take the gag off her mouth. He raise the drink to her mouth and Camilla starts quickly drinking the water through the while not breaking eye contact. He takes the cup away placing it aside. He rummages through the bag and pulls out large yellow apple."Abrelo(Open it.), the guy commands presenting the fruit only for her to not move an inch, "¡Vamos, abre la boca!(Come on now, open your mouth!), he stated becoming impatient.Camilla dismissively turns her head. The guy snaps grabbing her by the cheeks forcing her mouth open and making her bite off a big chunk of apple. Camilla chews it up a bit before spitting it all out right in his face. He wipes his face off."¡Perra!(Bitch!), her exclaims backhand slapping her hard across the face throwing the bag down. He then pulls out a knife aiming at her neck, ¡Maldito demonio del infierno! ¡Debería matarte aquí mismo!(Goddamn fuckin demon from hell! I should kill you right here!)Camilla glares at him feeling the cold blade against her throat. He then looks down her body." Dicho esto, no comes una mierda, pero tu cuerpo sigue luciendo sexy como la mierda.(That being said, you don't eat worth shit but your body still looking sexy as fuck.)", he says before tracing her hips and thighs as Camilla shifts in protest. He then traces up her stomach before breasts playing with her nipple. Camilla clenches her teeth using all her willpower to avoid being aroused by any of this. The guy smirks in satisfaction as he roughly gropes her making her squirm, "Te gusta eso, perra?(You like that don't you bitch?)He the shoves his hand down her pants between her legs fondling her womanhood."No!", Camilla exclaims in protest."No, no pares? Como desées.( No don't stop? As you wish.), the guy says tracing circles on her womanhood and groping her breast roughly. However, after a while, the guy grew angry as she didn't become wet at all despite all the stimulation. The guy retracts his hand from her pants his pride greatly hurt.Camilla spits right in his face before grinning triumphantly and chuckling heartily.The guy slaps her across the face again, "Crees que es gracioso, eh?(You thinks it's funny, huh?!)"Camilla spit some blood from her mouth the smirks at him, "Sí, si crees que ESO podría sacar a cualquier mujer. ¿Por qué no vuelves a practicar con la abuela?(Yes, if you think THAT could get any woman off. Why don't you go back to practicing with grandma.), she taunt before laughing at him.The picks up the cup and dumps the water all over her head making her laugh even harder."¡Sí, sí, te ríes ahora perra! ¡Estarás llorando cuando termine!(Yeah, yeah you laugh now bitch! You'll be crying by the time i'm finished!), The guy replies angrily closing the cell door and stomping away.¡Si! ¡Apuesto a que lloras después de terminar!(Yeah! I bet you DO cry after you finish!), Camilla stated heartily chuckling before letting out a relieved sigh glad she didn't have to see that human for awhile. Unfortunately, her respite is cut short when he returns with three more guys. He slams a button on the wall and Camilla falls to the floor hard."¡Levántala!( Get her up!)", the guy from earlier stated opening the cell for them. The enter forcing the Demoness to her feet as struggles to get free. The approaches her with a syringe grabbing her face and injecting it into her neck. After a few seconds, her muscles go limp making her unable to struggle but still remain conscious. The two men carry her under her arms dragging her legs along the floor the door at the far left end of room.The scene changed as they enter a large operating room filled with surgical equipment, oxygen tanks, and plastic tarps. The scent of blood and useless discarded liminal parts fermenting in the trash permeated the room.The push her on the cold metal table with dry blood stains and straps her hands down. The guy earlier grabs her yoga pants and panties yanking them both off and tossing them aside. Camilla tries to scream in protest before being gagged with the same scarf by one of the men. She tries desperately to move but her body was still unresponsive to her order.She sees the guy spreading her legs apart while unfastening his belt."Yo voy primero!(I'm going first!), the guy says but was stopped by his associate.¡Oye! ¿Por qué tienes que ir primero? Hicimos el trabajo pesado.(Hey! Why you get to go first?! We did the heavy lifting.), he complained. ¡Fue mi idea! ¡Yo voy primero!(It was MY idea! I'm going first!), the guy retorted.¿Oh enserio? ¿Qué idea sería esa?(Oh really? What idea would that be?), came the voice of Alejandro."Jefe! No es-(Boss! I-It's not-), the guy is cut off. "Amigos, lo entiendo. Trabajas duro y mereces divertirte. Honestamente, este ha sido malo para los negocios y creo que necesita aprender su lugar. Dos pájaros de un tiro (Friends, I understand. You work hard and you deserve to have some fun. Honestly, this one has been bad for business and I think she needs to learn her place. Two birds, one stone), Alejandro say taking off his suit and tie then unfastening his belt, "Si no te importa, me gustaría su coño. Puedes tener esa boca suya.(If you don't mind, I would like her pussy. You can have that mouth of hers.)Alejandro caresses her thighs spreading her wide before unzipping his fly taking his position ignoring Camilla muffled screams.¡Si jefe!(Yes, Boss!), The guy replies taking. He removes the gag on her mouth."Quítate de encima tu-AGGHHHHH!(Get off of me you-!), Camilla screams before getting hit with surge of electricity making her body convulse violently."Intenta cualquier cosa y maldeciré el día en que naciste.(You try anything, and I'll make curse the day you were born.), he threatened dangling the remote in front of her.Te mataré. Los mataré a todos.(I'll kill you. I'll kill all of you.), Camilla stated in her demonic voice before Alejandro punches her hard across the face. He does it a few more times leaving her face bloody and bruised as she spits blood from her mouth.He shakes off his bloody knuckles then notice her pussy was bone dry before getting an idea.Escuché que esta parte de ti es muy sensible.(I hear this part of you is very sensitive.), he says grabbing her tail much her sheer discomfort. Enjoying her reaction, he yanks and pulls it hard sending wave after wave of unwanted pleasure through her spine. He grins in satisfaction seeing her juices seeping from her pussy."Parece que ella está lista para irse chicos!(Looks like she's ready to go boys), Alejandro stated allowing his rock hard manhood to spring forth. Camilla glares hatefully just seething with pure rage. He shoves himself hard into her as she gasps in surprise."GAHmmph", Camilla elicits before the other guy yanks her hair back before shoving his cock down her throat. Knowing she couldn't do anything, she reluctantly surrendered to the men thrusting her from both ends. She wanted nothing more than to bite off the thing choking her or rip off the thing stabbing her but decided to simply wait until it was over.Caleb shook is head in disbelief trembling with rage, "Stop...Stop...STOP!"Caleb shouted as they continued to rape her. When Alejandro was finished, he moves and one of the other guys takes his place. A look of pride on the man's face. Caleb charges Alejandro only to phase right through him. Caleb then turns his attention to guy currently on top of her and tries to throw him off of her only for his hands to repeatedly phase through. He's then greeted by images of these men raping her on a few separate occasions after this. Each time Camilla's spirit breaking more and more. Caleb's eyes glow bright purple."NOOO!", he screams slamming his fist down as the world disintegrates into darkness as he clenches his head, "It's not real...hahh...it's not real."Caleb is then shown scenes with Camilla and several other Devils being loaded into the backs of trucks. Eventually the cartel managed to sell her. While relieved to be out of that place, she was now forced into the underground liminal prostitution chains throughout the states. Everyday she'd be stuffed into a different truck with other Devil women; some barely old to know any really powerful spells yet, and watch be auctioned off and sold to become toys to men of different species. Human, Orc, Goblin, all of them repugnant creatures looking to indulge themselves on Camilla's people. It sickened her to no end. She knew she had to escape the first chance she got.During these constant trip, Camilla had unintentionally admiration of whatever remaining Devils that were transported with her due to her willingness to stand up for them; despite being powerless. Caleb is greeted by scenes of these Devils as they each told their story of how they ended up here. Many he instantly recognized three of them, Hana, the twins, and Scarlett. Overtime, and because of her Elder Devil lineage, the rest grew to see Camilla as something of a 'Big Sister', especially Scarlett who seemed the most fond of her. As Camilla learned more about these girls, she began to understand Nadia's desire to help Devils like these. Camilla made up in her mind that she'll not only escape but escape with her new 'Amigas'.Eventually, Camilla and the rest were trafficked to the South Central U.S. where over time many of her new friends are sold of save for the few Caleb knew today.Caleb is greeted by scenes of Camilla and many other Devil girls being loaded out of the truck by cuff and chain.It is here where they first meet Gangster Renalds and Fat Bastard. Camilla, Scarlett, Hana, and the twins are forced into a black van where they are taken to a dilapidated house and led down into a basement. Here is where Camilla first met Jocelyn, Sharon, and the others. There were six other Devils Caleb didnt recognize. They were all cuffed to the walls by Renalds as Fat Bastard holds a shotgun on them. When done they ascend the stairs leaving them down there. Barely an hour later, Renalds returns leading several men down into the basement. Reynald shows them off as they take their pick of the girls examining them each like livestock. When they get Camilla she lashes out at them attempting to bite off the buyers fingers threatening them to stay away from the girls before Renald pistol whips her across the face before tazing her in the stomach making hunch over in pain. She and the others are then forced to watch four of her friends being led out of the by chain while Renalds counts a few stacks of cash. She sees Scarlett giving her a somber look. Camilla drops her head with a pained look on her face.The next scene shows Camilla cursing and screaming attempting to pulls herself from the wall as Fat Bastard slung a gagged and struggling Scarlett over his shoulders. He points a piston cocking it at her forehead. She could see Scarlett looking at her with desperate, teary eyes."Take me. TAKE ME DAMN JU! I DON'T CARE!", Camilla screams at him as Hana and the rest look on.Fat Bastard runs his pistol down her neck resting to her cleavage as Camilla shudders at the cold hard object. Bastard smirks at her reaction."Tempting offer...but I'm more into redhead hahahahaha!", he laughs"NO!", Camilla shouted as he ignores her taking Scarlett upstairs as the poor girl flails to get free and her muffled screams ring in Camilla and the rest minds.Even down in the basement, they could faintly hear Scarletts screams of protest and pain. Camilla shouts in rage conjuring a large blue magic seal only to before the collar activates dissipating the spell and delivering amount of golden lightning. Unimaginable pain fill her body as Hana and the rest voice their concern. She goes limp before falling unconcious.Caleb is then forced to watch more scenes with Camilla and the others in the weeks they were in that house. Ones where she and the others were stripped naked and hosed off outside one at a time by Renalds as Fat Bastard squirted body wash on them. Where they were fed crappy or expired food if anything at all. Where Camilla would typically feel the brunt of physical abuse by Renalds. In those weeks, Fat Bastard continued his fun with Scarlett as his toy. He kept her chained upstairs away from the others but they could always hear them. Always.Camilla had finally had enough. Luckily, her chances to escape came in the form of a loosening shackle on her cuffs she decided to bide her time until the perfect moment.It wasn't long before Renalds and Fat Bastards location was compromised and had to change location. They loaded Camilla and the others into a large black transport van where they were each handcuffed to the support handles on the walls. Around them were boxes of clothes and other strange items. As they are riding along, Camilla gradually loosens her cuffs more and more. During the ride, Camilla and the rest overhear Renalds and Fat Bastards mention something about '4th of july', a human tradition, which Camilla honestly couldn't care less about. They mention it at all since they were passing through a city called Huntsville and a 'parade' currently had the streets blocked off.Caleb pauses.Soon, nighttime came and Renalds, deciding they needed more gas, made a stop at the nearest station. They park in a vacant alleyway as Renalds gets out, grabs the gas tank from the back before threatening the girls not to move. He tell Fat Bastard to watch them then leaves. Camilla immediately gets to work on breaking free from her cuffs. She gets one off but struggled with the other. She then slices her wrist using her own blood as lubrication to slip her hand through. She then tries to help the others get their cuffs off before hear a knock from the passenger side."Hey! What's goin' on back der'?!", Fat Bastard stated. They don't respond and he gets out the car slamming the door. Camilla makes a shushing gesture to the girls as she grips the chain of her cuffs readying herself. The doors open"Alright, what the hell is-", was all Fat Bastard said before Camilla delivers good kick to his face sending him landing on his back. Camilla lunges from the truck landing near Fat Bastard. As he's picking himself up from his daze, she wraps the chain around his neck, plants her heel to his back, proceeding to strangle him with whatever strength she had. He coughs and gags while clawing at his throat. The other Devil girls watch intently with Scarlett repeatedly mouthing 'kill'em. Kill'em'.Camilla was close to snapping Fat Bastards neck before feeling excruciating pain in her back courtesy of Renalds and his tazer. She hollers out before falling to the side convulsing much to the shock of Scarlett and the rest. Fat Bastard cough violently holding his throat as Renalds shakes his head in disappointment."I'll be goddamn can't leave shit alone for two minutes huh?", Renalds scolds him putting down the gas tank then turns to Camilla weakly picking herself off the ground. He kicks her hard in the stomach as she grunts in pain. He squats and pulls her up by the hair before pointing a pistol right at her temple, "You becoming a reeaallll pain my ass now. Now you get back on that van nice and calmlike and I might forget about this.", he whispers failing to notice Camilla tail snaking up her back.She nods understandingly and he releases her hair letting her forehead hit the concrete. As Reynalds raises up, Camilla's tail shoots up jabbing him in the eye. He screams out holding his right eye before uses does a leg sweep knocking him off balance and making him drop his gun. It fires and Camilla gets nicked in the arm.Fat Bastard tries to grab but Camilla throws the chain and cuffs hitting him square in the groin. He falls to the ground in pain hollering loudly. Camilla leaps on top of Renalds collar and furiously bashing him against the concrete."Morir! mierda! mierda! sin! valor!(Die! You! Worthless! Piss! Fuck!", she exclaims each time she bashes his head and Scarlett and the rest cheer her on. Renalds then pulls his switchblade stabbing her right in the thigh and twisting as Camilla screams out in agony before he pushes her off. She clutches her wound as blood pools on the concrete. He lunges on top of her trying to stab her in a fit of rage while she tries to hold him away. The blade inches closer to her heart but Camilla knees him in the groin forcing him to roll off her. She quickly but shakily picks herself up her blood dripping down her leg. She looks to Scarlett and the rest."Run! Please!", Scarlett urges as the rest do the same. Camilla stand there reluctant to leave them behind.Reynalds lunges at her and slices her wing."AAAAGH!", Camilla screams out having one of her most sensitive parts damaged. He rushes her against but she dodges then performs a judo throw sending him back a couple feet. Scarlett kicks a box full of holiday crap Fat Bastard had bought spilling the content on top of Renalds."GO!", Scarlett pleaded. Camilla nods quickly limping away as fast as she could. She makes her way down the alleys knocking over trash cans and boxes moving as quickly as her body could carry her. She clumsily maneuvered down the sidewalk while avoiding any humans she saw under cover of dark. She didn't know where she was going, what to do, or where to go. She just kept going.She was about to exit another alleyway into the street but stop upon seeing crowds of humans and different species exiting a gated area.Caleb quickly recognizes the area, "No way..."Camilla leans herself against the brick wall panting heavily holding her stab wound. Her arm with the bullet wound stings ever time she lifts it. She watches from the darkness as the humans and other species walk down the streets or board their large transport machines deciding to wait until they were all gone to make her next move. She rips a long piece off her shirt using it to tourniquet her thigh.After what felt like eternity, most of the humans were gone leaving the street relatively quiet. Camilla weakly picks herself up and limps out. She had lost quite a bit of blood. She stumbles out using the wall for support trying to avoid the street lamps but trips on a box knocking over a metal garbage bin. She curses upon hitting the ground."Hello?", came a voice the alerted her. Caleb eyes widen immediately recognizing that voice. As Camilla picks herself up, the unknown voice reveals themselves stepping into the light . It was a young, dark skinned man with black low cut hair and medium build. Camilla curses upon being discovered. She couldn't have him alerting his other human friends and resolve to kill him the first chance she gets. Caleb gives her a look surprised at her thoughts."Oh my God! What happened to you?!", past Caleb spoke surprising Camilla a bit. He approaches her putting her on gaurd, "Hang on don't move don't move! I'll get you some-","Stay...away from me...filthy human.", Camilla hisses glaring at him hatefully while clenching a discarded rusty wrench knowing he was now aware of what she is. Caleb watches with concern as his past self approaches."Look, it's ok. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm going to get you help, ok?", past Caleb spoke assuringly. Camilla was surprised by the sincerity in his words. She didn't sense a trace of falsehood in his words and his eyes bore no ill-intent or disgust. It was a strange feeling. Against her nature, she decided to trust this human man...for now.She see him take something out his and put it to his ear, "Hello? 9-1-11, I have an emergency. There an injured Devil woman-"*Bang*A gunshot rang out as Camilla and Caleb look in horror as Past Caleb's brains are blown clean out of his head. His body collapses on the sidewalk and Camilla and Caleb are left speechless."W-W-WHAT? What the fuck? What the fuck? This is...hah!", Caleb uttered clenching his head shaking furiously. This isn't what happened! He's not dead! Is he?!The world around him glitches and flickers"Well well well, look who we found.", came the voice of Reynalds. Camilla turns with horrified expression seeing Reynolds and Fat Bastard standing there with the van. The door opens wafting purple steam seeing the anguished looks of Scarlett and the rest. Reynolds face distorts in a wide cartoonish but horrifying smile. Caleb backs away in fear. Large black chains shoot from the van locking around Camilla's body dragging her into the van."NO! NOOO!", Camilla screams as Renalds and Fat Bastards laugh hysterically their bodies shifting into monstrous forms.The scene distorts now show Camilla and the other Devil girls at the warehouse. Camilla was bound to the wall by black chains. Wick and the others Malones were dragging away Scarlett and the rest. She watched helpless as some are thrown on the floor and raped on the spot while they screamed for Camilla to save them."Camilla-sama! CAMILLA-SAMA!", Hana screams tear stained eyes reaching desperately for her as the man relentlessly pounds her from behind."YOU SAID YOU'D PROTECT US! YOU'RE A LIAR! A LIARRRRRR!", Scarlett screams as Fat Bastard drags her away again.Tears flow down Camilla face as she wails in despair. Caleb shakes his head. This is wrong. These aren't memories. It's a nightmare!Wick s then approaches Camilla grabbing her face forcing her to look at his predatory, cold expression."You will be a good little girl.", He spoke wickedly before morphing into Camilla's father."Seguro que creciste muy bien(You sure grew up reeaalll nice), he spoke in a lecherous tracing up and down her body. He then morphs into Abbadickhead."Time for another round Señorita.", He smirks spreading her legs.Caleb clenches his head as screams, despair, and hate fill his senses. He watches as the Abbadickhead repeatedly morph back and forth from wick to her father while thrusting her into her. The world becomes distorted and flickering violently. Loud rumbling and crashing permeated the area."This is wrong. This is wrong! THIS IS WRONNNNNNNNG!", Caleb screams body glowing with purple aura eyed burning with purple flames. He rushes over to her, grab the three for one asshole, pulling him off her then punching him square in the jaw to Camilla shock. They explode in a puff of purple smoke. He turns to Camilla gently cupping the side of her face, "Camilla, you have to wake up! It's not real! I'm ok!"A warm feeling spreads over Camilla as she looks deeply into his eyes."Señor Caleb...?""WAKE UP!", he shouts....*****Back in the real world******" HAAAAAAAA! ", Caleb exclaims shooting up then tumbling out of bed as Camilla does the same her chest heaving rapidly her body covered in sweat. Camilla looks around in panic before noticing Caleb on the floor. He gets to his knees feeling around the floor, the bed, and his own body; especially his head breathing rapidly as he regains his bearings on reality. He sits up back to the wall elbows to his knees as he clenches his head and wiping the sweat from his face. He sniffles covering his face in his palms"S-Senor?!", Camilla inquires worried tone, "What is wrong?!"Caleb merely looks up at her not saying a word. Camilla eyes widen seeing the tears running down his cheeks and sorrow in his eyes. Not for himself but for her.WRHoowee, this chapter was a hell of an undertaking. Been really, really busy with life continuously knocking me down. No lie it's been awful lately. Mom back and forth out of the hospital, school work has to be done, my new business isn't going as well as I thought, and the cherry on top I'm stuck with a year long lease for an apartment I can no longer stay because of a spike in Covid cases. Loving life!Sorry, don't mean to unload my bullshit on y'all. That's what Facebook is for. Anyway hope you enjoy the chapter. Be on the lookout for the next where things get...heated between Caleb and Camilla. Wink.Well, that's all the time for now. PEACE FAM!

Caleb sat on the floor wiping his tears away trying to compose himself while was unsure of what was going on but having a strange feeling of dread deep in her heart."Senor...please...tell me what is wrong?", Camilla inquires carefully in worried tone. Caleb looks up at her piercing red eyes the memories of everything flashing in his mind. He sighs and picks himself up. He sits on the edge of the bed right next to her avoiding looking at her which only worried her more, "S-Senor? What is the matter? Tell me!"Caleb is silent for a second then says in a low tone, "I know."Camilla raises an eyebrow, "Ju know what?""Everything.", Caleb answers plainly, "I know everything about. Your mother, your father, Victus, Nadia, Ursula...everything you've done...everything you've been through. ...I know all of it Camilla."Camilla goes silent her heart racing and eyes widen in utter disbelief. How could he know those names?! She's never told him or anyone else any personal details of her life, not even Scarlett and the others, so HOW could he know?"H...H...H-How...?", Camilla utters before gulping nervously.Caleb turns to her finally looking her in the eye, "Turns out...um, could you uhh...", he gestures to her distracting attire of red lace bra and panties. Camilla complies creating a blue magic seal levitating a red satin robe and putting it on covering herself. Caleb resumes, "Ahem, anyway, basically...I found out through your dreams."Camilla blinks, "m-mis sueños(m-my dreams)?"Caleb rubs the back of his head, "It's a...long story."Caleb spends the next 20 minutes explaining everything about Mirabelle's ability to enter dreams and the fact that she goes into his dreams every while emphasizing she does not go in anyone's dreams other than his. Camilla, while understandingly shocked, admitted she could always sense Mirabelle's strong mystical aura but found it strange she rarely ever uses her power. However, she had never knew such a form of mystic arts existed. Caleb proceeds to explain everything he saw in Camilla's dreamscape(Or her memories influencing the dreamscape? He was still figuring just HOW that all works.). Everything from her father's abuse to her mother's disappearance to...all the people she's killed...to even what happened to her in the cartel. After he was done, Camilla just completely silent for a minute processing everything as Caleb dies the same."So...ju know who I am.", Camilla spoke coldly eye directed downward to her hands.Caleb looks at her before replying, "Yeah.""And?", Camilla inquires expectantly."And...what?", Caleb replies a bit confused.Camilla rises up to her feet facing him, "Ju know 'what'! Ju know now...I am a killer. I have killed so many wicked men in those days. After...losing mi Madre and being surrounded by men that reminded me of HIM... I just...had so much HATE...I just lost control! But...I cannot say they did not deserve their fate. Vile humans like that deserve-"Camilla stops noticing Caleb's blank expression. She backs away, "W-What? Why are ju looking at me like that?!""I know that how you felt back. I could feel every emotion you had, not just 'hate'. You were alone. Scared. Always trying to survive.", Camilla spoke rising to his feet walking over to her, "Fearing you'll never see you mom again. But worse...afraid you were becoming like your dad."Camilla eyes widen in horror. She opens he mouth to say something to deny it but no words will come."Listen, I can't ever pretend I approve of your actions back then Camilla. And...I'd be lying if I said I'm not a little scared of you now.", Caleb admits as Camilla expression drops as sadness and fear of being rejected overtook her. Her head drops in defeat her hair obscuring her face as Caleb notices her trembling, "Bu-""Heheheh, I knew I did not belong here.", Camilla spoke sadly interrupting with a chuckle, "The kind of person I became. The person I am. It makes sense ju wouldn't want a murderer like me around and the others anymore. I bet it's why Madre left. She knew I was becoming...Him. Heheheheheh", She chuckles sadly clutching her head as tears stream down her face.Caleb approaches wanting to console her only for her to back away looking up at him with pain written on her face."I deserved everything I got after that! Everything since that night with the Angels was a part of mi punishment! Pain, loneliness, being used and thrown away! That's all a monster like me deserves! Ha, I was even given a chance to change and I still fucked it up! Now ju hate me too.", Camilla sobs her body trembling before sitting on the bed unable to stand on her trembling legs, "I can't take anymore. I can't...just leave me Señor. I will be gone before morning. Do not look for me."Caleb eyes widen immediately that tone in her voice. He knew all too well what she meant. He grabs her hands much to her shock as she looks at him."You listen to me Camilla! Whatever you're thinking, stop it! Now!", Caleb stated firmly. Camilla was about to say something but her cuts her off, "No, be quiet and listen! Let me finish!"Caleb sighs, "Yes, I know how you behave back then was unacceptable but THOSE guys, what they did, was even WORSE! I saw your memories, you only every killed men who harassed you first or had done unspeakable things to begin with and would've continued to do so! You may have saved more lives than you've taken, ever thought of that? You are NOTHING like that sick fuck of a father of yours! Not even close!""B-But I have killed many people...", Camilla utters"So did Genghis Khan, Caligula, and Hitler and they were WAY worse than you ever could be!", Caleb retorts to Camilla surprise who didn't quite know who those people are. Caleb resumes, "And don't you DARE say you deserved all of that. NOBODY deserves that type of cruelty because of what they are! Frankly, I hope those cartel fucks, your fuckboy of an ex husband, every person who bought your friends like merchandise, those shit fucks from the warehouse, all of them, I hope they burn in hell for hurting a sweetheart like you!"Caleb declaration shocks Camilla leaving her speechless. He then sits down right beside her."I don't hold any of that against you. Who knows what anyone would have done in your shoes. You survived all of that and that's what matters. I don't truly know what happened to your mom but, from what I've seen, she would not have abandoned you because of how you were acting. There must have been another reason she couldn'r stay with you. I don't know what but that's a discussion for another time the POINT is...I do NOT hate you Camilla and you're NOT a monster. You're just angry and you let that anger consume you at times. All you need is some self-control. I'm here for you. Not just me, Moon pie, Lyca, Drei and her sisters even Sterling; we'll help you going forward. You are not alone.", Caleb assured taking her hand squeezing firmly but gently.Camilla eyes widen floored by his declaration and genuine kindness in his eyes. It was almost too much for her heart to bare. She turns away from him in thought."Señor, are ju sure about this? W-What if there comes a day when you or anyone can't stop me? As long as I'm around, ju are always in danger. It wouldn't take much. A weak spell even just cut to your neck from mi claws and your life is gone.", Camilla says in cold tone."Yeah, true. But in case you forgot, even before this Malone business my life was in danger the day I was born!", Caleb stated surprising Camilla, "I'm human! Suffocating, concussions, diabetes, aneurysms, hell slipping in the bathroom; it Is RIDICULOUSLY easy to kill us. Yet we still continue on inspite of whatever the world throws at us. If the price being with you, Moon pie, and Lyca, and loving each and every one of you is death...i'll pay it. It's a bill WORTH paying.", Caleb stated with resolve while touching her shoulder making her face him. The determination in his eyes told Camilla he meant every single word he said. She could not take eyes away for behind lie the most beautiful soul she had ever seen. Possibly rivaling that of he mother's."Besides if you REALLY wanted to kill me, I'm sure you would have done it by now. I notice today when we were close you always made sure didn't grip me too hard, bump me with your horns, or cut me with your claws. Even when those assholes were harassing us you made tried to make sure I wouldn't get hurt. So I know you wouldn't hurt me intentionally.", Caleb says as Camilla goes silent.Camilla shakes her head in disbelief much to Caleb's concern. She then says, "I cannot believe I thought of killing ju. I cannot believe what I almost lost.", she spoke in a sorrowful tone realizing she nearly made the biggest mistake of her life that night. Caleb already knew what she meant and gently pets her head even caressing her horns much to her surprise."Well, you didn't. That's all that matters. THAT and the fact that I gained one of the coolest people in my life right now. Despite my reservations concerning the logic behind her "magic" ", Caleb playfully jeers.Camilla lightly giggles wiping her tears away, "Huhu, that stubbornness of yours will be fun to break Señor.""Ha! Good luck, my head is harder than diamond baby.", Caleb says tapping his knuckles to his head."Jes, a bean head hard as diamond.", Camilla teases."Awww now you starting it too I see!", Caleb replies as the two as them share a laugh together. Caleb then opens his arms for a hug, "Come here."Camilla happily accepts pressing herself firmly against his chest. Caleb pats her back even gently caressing her flattened down wings showing he accepted everything about her much to her delight. Camilla could hear and feel his heartbeat and was surprised to find it was beating in perfect with her own. Caleb could feel it as well. It just felt...right for some reason.The two separate for a moment. Silence falls as they stare into each other's eyes as the world seems to dissolve around them. The two of them inch ever closer to each other until their lips finally meet.***LEMONS***Camilla and Caleb feel a surge of electricity between them as if ever molecule in their bodies screaming in excitement and their very souls were reach out to connect with one another. Camilla marveled at the sensation of his lips against hers. The two seperate again staring in surprise. Camilla touches her finger to her lip longingly staring at him.Caleb clears his throat nervously, "Uhh...that was...something else. N-Not that it was weird or any-MMPH!", Caleb starts before Camilla tackles him to the bed. She hungrily peppers his lips in kisses climbing on top of him mushing her breasts into his chest wrapping her arms around his head. She moans sticking her tongue at his lips wanting access. Caleb instinctively wraps his arms around her back parting his lips allowing her entrance."~Mmmm Senor...~", Camilla excitedly moans exploring every centimeter of his mouth while enjoyed how sweet she taste while combing his fingers through her hair. The sensation of a forked tongue against his mouth was strange but pleasant. They both wrestled for dominance neither of them giving an inch until Camilla aggressively forces herself down throat his wanting to taste as much of him as possible. Not wanting to lose, Caleb goes on the aggressive as well. Saliva drips out the corner of their mouths as their moans of pleasure and lip smacking of their makeout session fills the room. Heat was building between them, especially in Camilla. Before she realized it, she was grinding her womanhood against his hardened member.Unfortunately, the need for oxygen precluded the desire for more pleasure.*smack* Camilla audibly pops off of Caleb leaving a trail of saliva connecting them while panting to catch her breath as Caleb does the same. She raises off him straddling his waist look down at him with loving expression blushing cutely."S-Senor...hahhh...I...s-sorry I just...", Camilla apologies chest heaving feeling as if her heart was going to burst, "I could not hold back anymore. It has been so long since I've been this happy."Caleb pushes him up with his elbow, "Haha...Yeah, I...understand...you don't have to apologies. We ARE lovers after all. I want to make you happy too."Camilla blushes grinning before giving him another passionate kiss, "Mi Drestino.", she hums softly before getting off him standing up as Caleb sits himself up. She proceeds to undo the sash on her satin robe opening it up to allow him full view of her glorious I-Cups and luscious thighs in red lace bra and panties before tossing the robe away. Caleb stares wordlessly gulping hard as she traces her hands around her curves tantalizingly enjoying his nervous demeanor. He couldn't help admiring every inch of her as she seductively swayed her hips. Caleb takes his shirt off throwing it on a nearby stool before turning to her sitting on the edge of the bed.Camilla admire his slightly chubby but muscular physique.She reaches to undo her bra but hesitates glancing away with an unsure expression. Caleb picks up on what may be running through her mind; having to do stuff like this before."You're so beautiful. I hope you know that.", Caleb says encouragingly.Camilla turns to him a blush crossing her cheeks not used to hearing something like that in this situation, "G-Gracias Señor", she utters feeling a bit more sure of herself. She unhooks her bra allowing her miracles of nature flop freely. Caleb jaw drops once again getting to admire her lovely brown orbs with pink creme top nipples. She sits down next to him and Caleb struggles to maintain eye contact.She takes shakily takes his hand guiding it to breast. She flinches slightly the second Caleb takes her soft, squishy flesh orbs instinctively squeezing her a bit inciting a squeak out of her. He cups her other breast is his other hand and proceeds to massage them squeezing gently as flesh spills through his fingers. Camilla clenches her eyes shuddering at his touch and trying to stifle her moaning."H-How does it feel Señor?", Camilla mutters avoiding partially opening her eyes but turning away from him. Caleb couldn't deny it felt great but couldn't ignore her painful demeanor. She looked...just like when her ex-husband would... Is she forcing herself? Caleb pulls his hands away to her surprise and worry, "W-What is wrong?!""Camilla, you know you don't have to do this.", Caleb says assuringly."N-No Señor! I do, I really do!", Camilla replies leaning in closer with pleading eyes."Then you should know the experience shouldn't be one-sided. I want you to feel good too not just me. Let me take care of you too, ok?", Caleb says caressing her face as she looks into his brown eyes. She was surprised but warmed by how much he considered her feelings. A smirk crosses his lips, "Actually...could you do one thing? ""Que?", Camilla tilts her head questioningly toward him before he leans in and whispers in her ear. She blushes heavily making an 'OH' gesture with her hand to her mouth."That is, if you want.", Caleb says."J-Jes, I do.", Camilla assures him before standing up proceeding to slide her underwear down past her thighs leaving her perfectly plump butt in all it's glory and leaving her completely naked. Caleb gulps taking a deep breath before getting in position. Camilla sits down covering her special legs closed as Caleb positions herself in front of her. Camilla looks Caleb up and down and he stood before her in just his underwear becoming nervous. Caleb reaches down touching her shoulder and leans down kiss her. She resisted the urge to pull away looking up with slight fear in her eyes before Caleb gently caresses her cheek."Shhh, it's ok.", Caleb whispers lovingly before gently kissing her. The fear in her eyes melted away replaced but trust. She relaxes as Caleb proceeds to kiss her down her neck leaving love marks and inciting a content sigh from her. He continues to her collarbone before finally arriving at her breast making her tense as he kisses around her flesh. He then takes one of her breasts in one hand gently squeezing and caressing it as he attentively kissed, nibbled, and sucked on her soft flesh making her tremble and moan in delight. He takes a bold move and takes her nipples in his mouth swirling his tongue around enjoying the taste of her."~HAHHHHH...hahhhhhh...Senor...Se siente asombroso(it feels so good)! Hahhhh... ~, Camilla moans loudly grabbing the back of his head pushing him into flesh seeking more pleasure. Her wings twitch violent as her tail flails about, "~H-Harder Señor haaahhh~"Caleb complies massaging her malleable flesh more roughly and sucking her more enthusiastically making her moan even louder in ecstasy. She never knew doing this could REALLY feel this amazing. She's always had to endure her wretched husband desires never having the chance to experience true pleasure herself. She's only now realizing how much she's been deprived of true affection. No, she's been starving this whole time! She grips his head tighter wanting every once of it she could get. After a minute of fondling, Caleb loudly pops off her breast and removes himself much to her confusion and distress."N-No...don't stop! Please Señor!", Camilla stated grabbing his arm looking at him with pleading almost desperate eyes."Who said I was? I was getting to the good part.", Caleb smiles at her, "Sooo kinda need both arms for that. Can you...uh...lay back please?"Camilla gives an uncertain look but releases his arm before laying down on her back with her knees raised. Seeing Caleb standing look down at her made her uneasy but chose to trust him.Caleb inhales steeling his nerves before kneeling to her in front of knees. He gently caresses her legs and thighs as Camilla trembles from his strong but kind fingers gliding across her smooth, shapely legs. He gently kisses around her knees. Camilla understood what he was doing and opened her legs allowing him access. Caleb eyes widen upon seeing her glistening, nearly shaven womanhood for the first time. The sweet yet somehow spicy scent radiating off her was intoxicating and her folds were already covered in her love juices. Caleb gulps before noticing Camilla looking down at him in anticipation. Caleb mentally slaps himself before continuing.He kisses around her inner thighs as she moan softly her heart racing as her inched further and further to her special. Caleb then plants a kiss on her lower lips making her squeak in surprise.Caleb licks some of her juices from his lip. His body pulsates a moment sending him in a daze as jolt went down his spine and his eyes glow purple for a second. Camilla notices his blank expression."S-Senor-HAAHHHHH!", Camilla inquires before exclaiming in surprise as Caleb suddenly plunges down greedily licking and sucking her womanhood. She squirms moaning in pleasure as he hungrily devoured her. He shoves his tongue inside tasting Camilla arches her back at the hot, wet muscle scraping her walls while shouting in pure bliss. The sound wet sloshing and sucking and the Demoness' lustful moaning filled the room spurring his sudden carnal lust even more. Camilla closes her thighs around his head trapping him in soft flesh prison as she grips his head with her hands wanting him deeper inside her. Her head was fuzzy and her eyes were glazed with pure unrestrained desire. She feels him gripping and squeezing her thighs for support"~hahhh...HAAHH...this...this what I wanted for long! Love me! LOVE ME SEÑOR! Make a mess of my body! Please!~", Camilla screams in delirium and slight desperation.Caleb churns her love canal enjoying how good she tasted and reaching his hands to caress her hips before feeling her tail against his wriggling against his arm. An naughty idea crosses his mind and he grabs her tail. Camilla eyes shoot wide."~AHHHHHH...N-NO! Not my tail! It's sensit-HaaaAAAAAHHH!", Camilla elicits as he starts strokes her tail up and down. She opens her legs freeing his head as he raises up."Heheh oh believe me, I know.", Caleb spoke in a playful tone bring the spade-shaped tip of her tail in front of him as he rubbed it with his fingers sending waves of ecstasy rippling through the squirming Demoness body, "How about I finish what I started from that night?"Camilla eyes widen realizing what he before arching her back moaning loudly in sheer bliss as her licks, sucks, and nibbles the tips of her tail. He then inserts his middle and ring fingers into her soaking wet love canal churning her tightening walls as she digs her claws into covers overwhelmed by the double stimulation."Haaaaaaa! ¡Mi cuerpo está en llamas! ¡Me encanta! ¡Lo amo tanto! Soy tuyo mi Destinado! ¡Siempre!(My body is on fire! I love it! I love it so much! I'm yours my Destined One! Forever!)", Camilla moans heartily even though Caleb didn't understand a word she said."Didn't understand a word you said but I think it was good!",Caleb says stroking and gently pulling her tail."~S-Senor! I-I can't...I can't hold...HAAAHHHHHHHH!", Camilla screams in ecstasy arching her back as her big orgasm hit leaving the blanket and Caleb hand drenched in warm liquid. Camilla goes body limp her chest heaving up and down basking in the afterglow and feeling satisfaction unlike any other.Caleb released her tail letting it flop limply beside her before wiping his palm on the blanket. He then raises his hand staring pensively at the little bit still on the back of his hand. He had no idea why this weird habit started but he compulsively like the remainder of his hand. His eyes and even the mark on his chest glow purple for a second.He then lies down next to Camilla, "That was...quite the experience. Honestly, that's the first time I've done conalingus...with anyone so I hope..."Camilla turns to him with adoring ruby red eyes and smiles contently, "It was wonderful Señor. Muchos Gracias.", she says before lovingly caressing his cheek before planting a kiss on his lips."Now that I understood.", Caleb replies with a smirk making her giggle, "I love that laugh of yours.""~Oh? Anything else ju love about me Señor?~", Camilla spoke flashing a devilish mushing her breasts under her arm. Caleb gulps blushing sheepishly."Yes...your big beautiful bodacious personality.", Caleb replies with a smirk."~Well...", Camilla hums tracing his chest with her claws before drifting further down past his stomach as Caleb gives her a tentative look to which she smirks, "~allow me to show more of mi personality Senor~".Caleb shudders the second her delicate but strong fingers begin stroking his rock hard manhood through his pajamas. She unfastens the button allowing hardened member to spring forth from it's prison. She looks down at it with intrigue before wrapping it around her fingers taking it's firmness and texture. Caleb squirms at her touch as she begins to stroke him up and down being extra careful with her sharp nails."Hnnnngh...", Caleb strains as his body quiver under her touch. Camilla smirks enjoying his reaction."Does it feel that good Señor?", Camilla whispered seductively pressing her naked breasts breasts into his chest sending chills down his spine. Caleb moans softly as she quickens her pace enjoying his flustered expression. She then feels something wet, and sticky against her fingers before looking down at the precum coating his shaft and fingers. She ceases pumping bringing her hand to her face intrinsically examining the sticky, musky smelling substance. She gives it a taste as Caleb raises a eyebrow at her. Her face lights up as a smile crosses her lips."Ahh sabrosa(ahh tasty)!", Camilla exclaims before hungrily licking the rest off her fingers unnerving Caleb a little. When done she turn to him with twinkling red eyes, "Señor, ju taste so good! I never knew a man could taste anything like this; especially a human!""You guys sure are good at giving me compliments I'm afraid to accept.", Caleb replies before Camilla quickly moves down to his legs. She position herself right over his member allowing her mountainous tits to dangle temptingly over him. Caleb gulps nervously noticing red glowing lustful eyes and lewd smile as she panted in excitement like a hungry predator looking over it's prey."U-uh...C-Camilla?""If that was a mere taste, I cannot imagine what the full essence is like! ~Huhuhu only one way to find out.~", Camilla spoke seductively her words flowing like smooth silk with hints of lewdness as she grabs her breast in both hands. She smothers Caleb cock in her soft, brown prison kneading them like dough with expert precision making Caleb throw his head back in ecstasy. Camilla giggles as his hot member adorably bobs in and out of her cleavage twitching with ever move she made. She licks at the head whenever she got a chance tasting his precum and sent jolts of pleasure up Caleb spine."NNNGHHAAGHHH...Oh h-hahhhh...hahhh holy fuck!", Caleb elicits in pleasure bringing a grin to Camilla's face. She swirls her forked tongue around his head before taking his entire cock in her mouth going all the way down to the hilt and hitting the back of her throat. Years of doing stuff like this for her ex had taken away her gag reflex. However, unlike him, she actually likes how Caleb feels in her. She bobs her head up and down swirling her tongue around and kneading her breast into his groin; all with near perfect precision." HAAAHHHH-holy fuck oh fuck oh Hnahhhhhhh...Holy fuck Camillahhhhh...", Caleb moans loudly in ecstasy and throwing his head back as he pat her head approvingly. Camilla giggles seeing his lewd expression sending pleasurable vibrations on his cock. As much as he hated to admit it, but Camilla was leagues better at this Moon pie."Ahhh Camilla! Hahhh I can't ho-ahhhhld it! I'm gonna come!", Caleb stated through ragged breath.Camilla responds be speeding up her pace. She bobs her head at insane speed as Caleb repeatedly hits the back of her throat bringing Caleb further to his limit."AHH Camilla! HAAHHhhhhhh!", Caleb exclaims an orgasmic scream firing his load deep in her throat. Camilla cheeks puff out before gulping a couple times before popping off with gasp for breath as Caleb fires one last strand on her breasts. Caleb takes a second to catch his breath as Camilla throws her head to the ceiling in orgasmic delight. Her eyes glow bright red as rippling red aura covers her body as Caleb stares dumbstruck. A strange pink glowing symbol appears on her lower stomach. It looked like...a pink heart-like shape?"HAhhhhhh Por la gracia de Discord, no quiero que este sentimiento termine(By the grace of Discord, I don't want this feeling to end.)", Camilla spoke cradling her chest and rocking back and forth in sheer euphoria. The aura fades away as does the weird vaginal symbol while the Demoness goes in a trance and trembling slightly.****LEMON CREME PIE*****"Uhhh Camilla...you ok?!", Caleb inquires becoming a little worried. She looks down at him a physics defying grin crossing her lips, "Ok Camilla you're starting to scare me a li-AH."She presses hand to his sides hovering over him her breasts dangling limply, "I knew it! I just knew ju truly were mi Destino! How else could human spirit energy be THAT delicious?!", she stated enthusiastically.Caleb gives a confused look, "I'm sorry...spirit whaaa?""Your life essence Señor. The energy of your soul. It can be release in a number of ways but the most concentrated version is through ejaculation. All non-human species crave it espescially mystic arts users like myself.", Camilla explains wiping the remainder of his orgasm off her breasts then casually scooping it in her mouth. Her eyes glow again as she grins swooning in euphoric delight, "~Haahhhh and your spirit energy is of immense quality. Muy deliciosa. I can feel mi power growing. I may have developed an addiction Señor.", Camilla swoons mushing her breasts into his chest and caressing his cheeks."Kayyyy, so what I got from that is human semen contains part of our souls...and eating it makes liminals like you stronger. That about right?", Caleb says in an incredulous tone."Si.", Camilla replies casually with a grin.Caleb inhales not even gonna bother questioning it any further, "Yeah alright.""Hmmm? No debate or clever quip involving your "scientific reasoning" Señor?", Camilla spoke coyly raising an eyebrow."Honey, I'm a man with an ever-growing list of superpowers in bed with a Mexican Devil woman. I'm learning to take the insanity in little by little. Something to anchor me to reality. ", Caleb replies as Camilla playfully rolls her eyes.He then ponders on that symbol he saw on her lower stomach.Camilla kisses his cheek, "Huhu Señor I believe I am ready for a second helping. Only this time, let us truly join as one.", she whispers huskily as Caleb shudders feeling her soaking wet pussy grinding against his shaft.Caleb clenches his teeth knowing he shouldn't do this but couldn't deny how good it felt. He then feels Camilla raise up positioning her opening over his member and lowering herself down moaning in anticipation. The second his tip pushes past her lip an image of Moon pie flashes in his mind."N-No stop!", Caleb stated as she stops looking down in confusion feeling him pull away. Camilla stops straddling him."W-what is wrong?!", she nervously inquires."We...we can't go that far...not yet at least.", Caleb stated, "Not with ICEP laws still in place.""Why not?! Ju are mi Destino! Why should what they say matter?!", Camilla stated."Because if they find out you'll all be deported! They have ways to test if we did it Camilla; they'd find out and that would be the end of it. I wouldn't see any of you ever again.", Caleb replies gently laying a hand on her thigh before Camilla places her hand on top of his. A slightly frustrated look was on her face, "I know how you feel. I wish we could do much more. But we have to let our feelings out in other ways for now. Understand?""...Si, Señor...", Camilla spoke softly lying down on his chest burying her head in the pillow beside him with her chin in the crook of his neck. Caleb hugs her caressing her back and wings. He frowns slightly knowing what he was saying was only the half truth but he wasn't going to think about that now."But... that doesn't mean we can't have show how we feel in other ways. What ICEP don't know won't hurt'em and more importantly us.", Caleb whispers huskily caressing the soft membrane of her wings making her body shudder and moan in his ear. Guess this part of her is sensitive too."Hahhh Señor?", Camilla spoke softly raising her head as her ruby red eyes lock with his chocolate brown. Caleb see the fiery passion in those eyes, "Ju know, they could not keep me from ju. Even if they take me halfway around the world, I will alway come for ju and I will find ju! No one will stop me!"Caleb gives a look not liking the tone she had, "I know. But...promise me you won't go overboard? Killing people is almost never the answer Camilla, especially not in this day and age. You're a very passionate woman just don't take things too far...ok?".Camilla pauses a moment in thought before answering, "I...I won't Señor. I promise I will try to control myself more. For ju...and myself."Caleb caresses her hair and horns as she sighs in content, "That's more than good enough."Camilla gently kisses his lips, "Señor...I love you. I love ju so much.", Camilla spoke passionately.He blushes before grinning sweetly, "I...I love you too, Camilla."Camilla's heart soars upon hearing those words. She hugs him lovingly nuzzling firm chest while careful not to so much as prick his skin with the tip of her horns. Caleb didn't it in the slightest, she deserved to be happy.She then stops before raises up with a serious expression, "Señor...tomorrow...I want to tell the others.""About what?", Caleb inquires."Me, Señor. It...is not right they do not know who I am, what I have done. They...are mi familia...jes?", Camilla spoke sheepishly before Caleb pats her assuringly."Of course we are. Your taking a brave step Camilla. I'll be by your side the whole time, ok?", Caleb says encouragingly."Gracias Señor.", Camilla thanks him before beaming a lustful grin a him."Huhuhu, ju were right about what ju said about me being passionate. Mi gente (my people) are naturally passionate lovers. Twice more passionate as humans females. I am from Mehico where women are twice as passionate period. ~Huhuhu that means I have quadruple the passion Señor.~", Camilla smirks devilish cupping her breast in one hand caressing her thigh with the other.Caleb gulps audibly, "Oh yeah that's...a whole lot of passion.""~Si, and that first batch of spirit energy ju supplied me with was amazing. If it's ok with ju, I would love a second helping.~", Camilla spoke seductively before positioning herself around her face right over her hardened manhood and her plump butt and thighs over Caleb's face, "~In return, ju can eat me as much as my wish huhuhu~", she says swaying her hips enticingly as Caleb gulps as the sweet aroma wrafting from her pulsating womanhood. He then feels her fingers wrap around his member stroking him off."Well...what kind of man would I be to turn down such a basic request?", Caleb replies caressing her soft thighs and digging his fingers in her plump, juicy rear as she moans huskily. He slaps her butt making it jiggle eliciting a startled yelp from the Demoness. She then plunges his cock deep in her throat as he spreads her cheeks plunging his tongue in her love canal.The two spent the next hour like this in heated passion before eventually falling asleep. Unbeknownst to them, Mirabelle's astral form still roamed the outside of the house, even going over the Zyklons house a couple times. Soon it returns back to it's original body upon noticing the sunrising in the distance. It makes it's way to her bedroom phasing through soon approaching the meditating Centaur. It touches her shoulder before changing into purple aura getting absorbed in Mirabelle's body. Mirabelle's eyes open and she had a serious look on her face as she looks out the window to the morning sun."That settles it. I need to talk with him today.", she says to herself....Meanwhile...Somewhere in Atlanta...A black buick lacrosse is driving down the city streets. It's driver, a man in all black with a rose pin on the side. His passenger, Fantina. The Baphomet had spent the last couple days gathering information before finally obtain a lead to her assignment. She looks out the window hand resting on her elbow watching the morning sun rising over the city in deep thought. They eventually arrive in a bad part of the city with several buildings that had been closed for years, homeless people on the sidewalks, and several reports of drug related activity. Fantina spots her destination, a large building that was a former recreational center before being closed for the deaths of nine children by the staff. It was rumored to be haunted as anyone who ever goes near the location is never seen or heard from again.The car pulls up to the sidewalk and Fantina exits the vehicle. She taps her shoulder creating a tiny magic seal on her arm giving any human that sees her the appearance of a raggedy homeless woman. The driver recoils at the sight."I might be long. Park somewhere far from here and don't worry...i'll come to you.", Fantina spoke tapping the car door creating a tiny purple seal. The man agrees trying not to look at her, "Oh grow up asshole!"Fantina turns to the building as the car pulls away and begins walking. She cautiously around at the overgrown grass and weeds as she steps closer to the building. Most windows were boarded up save for a few in the upper section. Her sharp instincts telling her she was being watched. Suddenly, she feels her hoof trip against a string. Time appears to slow down as several needle-like darts are launched at her which are blocked by her barrier. She continues onward tripping more traps as a barrage of needles launch at her from all direction only to bounce off her barrier landing on the concrete walkway. She pick one up examining it and finding they were coated in some form of neurotoxin.Suddenly, a long green blade appears from the grass about to chop her head off. Fantina instinctively blocks with the handle of her scythe as sparks fly from the clash. She turns seeing a figures arm with her face obscured in shadow save for her cold, emerald eyes glaring at her with killing intent."I'm not here to fight. I have a message from Mama Rosé. I would request an audience with the rest of your team.", Fantina spoke as the figure closed its eyes acceptingly before withdrawing its blade and silently vanishing into the grass.Suddenly, the boarded up door open. She takes a deep breath before teleporting over to the opening not to deal with anymore traps. She cautiously steps inside taking not of the dimly lit hallway to her left and right. There appeared to be some kind of makeshift barricades made from barbed wire and wooden pikes at both ends of the hallway. In front of her were a pair of metal gymnasium doors with a glowing green Exit sign with the 'IT' covered by black spray paint. She could make out what sounded like muffled yelling from behind them. The doors slowly open wide revealing a well lit area."FUCK YOU BITCH!", Yelled an unknown voice before a glass ashtray goes souring over Fantina head, but she ducks anyway, before shattering behind her with a loud crash.Fantina eyes widen in surprise seeing the large surprisingly well-established area. To the left were appliances like two refrigerators, a large freezer, two washer and dryer machines, and right next to it was a kitchen-like are with marble counter with sink and dishwasher set, two ovens, and four white wooden cabinets. There was a privacy curtain installed around the kitchen area but Fantina could smell something delicious cooking and a black silhouette of someone behind the curtain.To the left, she saw a bunch of school desks stacked up in a large fort with the words 'Fort Kickass' spelled out in red paint. The was also a bunch of workout equipment. Weights, ropes, two large tractor tires, even punching bags full of sand. There were an assortment of weapons hanging on display from katanas to long spears, all of them real. Next them were a set of bleachers that had been modified with little training dummies to be used for target practicing.In the far back, to the right of the second gymnasium doors were several bookshelves filled with an assortment of literary volumes. Two large wooden tables and chair could be seen with stacks of books sitting there. There was even a computer set up in the corner.Finally, the center of the arena had three large couches and one recliner seated around large circular maple wood coffee with a 72 in flat screens seat on an entertainment center. The entire area was decorated in an assortment of wall graffiti, banners, along with wall art, masks, framed pictures, and little shinto statues place in different spots."Arrghhhhh! This little bitch is pissing me off!", Yelled the an angry liminal standing near the tv.Fantina then focuses on the two liminals around the couches near the tv. One of them, a tall feline liminal with tan complexion with tribal tattoos all over her body, golden brown eyed, light brown hair and fur with dark brown spots cover her clawed hands up to her elbow and legs up to her knees. She had rounded ears, long panther like tail, and wore cut-off jean shorts with skin tight orange shirt showing off her plump rear, sporty B-cups and curvaceous but athletic physique. She also had what looked like a large club with beaded spikes at her side and tribal mask dangling at her hip like a keychain. An Ocelot."Take it easy Kulah. It's just a movie. That's the third of my ashtrays you've broken.", came the calm feminine voice of another liminals leaning against the couch legs crossed and reading a small book. She was dressed in what appeared to be a black and dark pink female ninja attire complete with string but lightweight knee and arm guards, long black sash around her neck, hiragana style Japanese black etchings all over her outfit, and black scarf covering her face. She had fair complexion, long black hair tied in a ponytail, pink demonic eyes, and a well-toned and beautiful appearance. Her outfit had openings for her D-cup breasts and plump thighs with black Japanese kanji for "Night" and "Killer" on her right breast and left thigh respectively. She had kunai knives attached to her thigh and throwing stars and other weapons in a small pouch along with a purple katana and wakazashi set propped beside her. However, her most striking features were her pointed ears, vertical black Devil horns on the sides of her head, and the slender black tail ending in a very sharp almost metallic-looking spade. A Kunoichi."How can I take it easy with a main character this idiotic?! Her husband doesn't know his place so SHE decides to just LEAVE?! FUCK that! Kick his ass! If it were me, I'd show him who wears the pants! He EEVERRR cheats on me I'll put his nuts on PERMANENT lock and key!", the Ocelot apparently named Kulah stated with ferocious intensity. Fantina notices they were watching 'Gone Girl' on the flat screen."That would be a very short movie otherwise. Not to mention controversial in all weirdly right ways.", the Devil ninja says in an unamused tone reading her book. It was then Fantina noticed her slight Asian accent."Whatever Madoka, you know I'm right!", Kulah back to the indifferent ninja named Madoka, "Another thing! What the hell was up with that scene with that Desi guy she kills?! She says it's killing two birds with one stone. HOW?! How can you kill TWO birds with ONE stone?! Is the stone magic?! Does it split into two seperate stones after it's thrown?! HOW DOES THAT WORK?! Dumbass human woman pissing me off!", the irate Ocelot angrily pounds the coffee table as the ninja wordlessly flips through her book."Now now girls, it's too early to bicker. How about instead of two birds and a stone we get two eggs and a scone. Ohoho that's a good one.", came a joking feminine voice as the curtain slides opens showing a liminal woman pushing a metal cart with a ton of food from steak, bacon, eggs, scones, and other things.She was close to Kulah height, had a tan complexion, fiery red eyes, medium black hair with strips of red stripes. She wore a white t-shirt with the tinder symbol on it with a v-neck opening for ample D-cup breasts. She had an hourglass figure with voluptuous hips held snuggly by her blue jeans. She dark red webbings in place of ears and her arms legs were reptilian claws covered in dark red and black scales. She had a long dark red slender tail protrudes from her back and appeared to have little heat radiating off it to keep to food warm. A Salamander.She then presents a plate with a ribeye steak, eggs, and a cresant which Kulah happily took immediately scarfing down the steak, "Mmmph, danks Ember!""Ah, be careful of the bone this time Kulah! And don't talk with your mouth full. It's unsanitary.", Ember chided cringing slightly in a noticeable Middle Eastern accent."That's actually offensive coming from you. I hope you used the actual stove this time and not your tail again.", Madoka replied with a skeptical look.Ember gasps taken aback, "I...s-so what? It is customary for my people to serve cooked by out own flames to the people we cherish. It's a gesture of everlasting friendship!""Uh huh, tell that to a health inspector.", Madoka replied before Ember crosses her arms puffing her and turning away with a huff.Fantina gives a puzzled look before the another girl appears out of nowhere. She had a fair complexion, greenish-yellow short hair, and a lean but toned physique. She was dressed in all green with ankle length boots, skin tight green bodysuit cut off at the shoulder and upper thighs, and dark green lightweight armor padding running down her sides, legs, and forearm. Her perky B-cups formed the outline of her chest and her tight shapely butt and thighs gave her a more curvaceous shape. Her most prominent features were the large green antennae sticking out the top of her head along with the two large yellow oval-shaped insect eyes and smaller ones sitting just above the human eyes of the same color. She had normal human hand and feet her forearm were equipped with long and very sharp green carapace covered scythes. Behind her was a large dark green abdomen like that of a praying mantis. She WAS a Mantis. Fantina recognized those blades understanding this was the person who attacked her moments ago.The Mantis approaches Madoka tapping her shoulder as Kulah and Ember notices her."Huh? What are you doing in here Hush? Ain't you supposed to be patrolling this morning?", Kulah inquired incredulously.The Mantis, named 'Hush', wordlessly gives her a look before gesturing to the Baphomet standing in the doorway. The girls turn a glare at the unknown visitor."My name is Fantina! I'm looking for the group known as Komanda Monstra!", Fantina announced as Marika, Hush, Ember glance at each other studying Fantina cautiously before readying themselves to attack. Kulah walks up to Fantina effortlessly twirling her heavy club like a bat imposingly."That all depends on why your askin'.", Kulah says stopping in front of Fantina towering over her and glaring with killing intent before audibly slamming the head of her club to the floor, "If it's something stupid like 'can you have our autograph?', I'll turn you into ground meat right now. Then I'll take those horns of yours and add'em with my collection. And they'll make a great addition.", she threatens reaching down to touch her horns only for Fantina to back away glaring at her. Kulah smirks."I'm here on behalf of Mama Rosé!", Fantina stated. Kulah and the other girls eyes widen in surprise of hearing that name, "There's a matter of great importance she wanted to discuss with all of you. In short, she requires your services.""Tch, when does she ever NOT need us? We're always taking care of the trash this organization builds up. Tell ya what quarter-pint, why don't you go prance on back to to Rosé and tell her what she has to say she can say it in person.", Kulah stated as Fantina clenches her fists glaring at the Ocelot, "Heyyy! What's that look? What ya mad? Is the baby goat mad? You wanna fight? Go ahead...*clang*...come at me if your worth a damn."Fantina was fighting the urge to summon her scythe as she clenched her teeth. She feels the area around her growing."OWOWOWOWOWOW HOT HOT HOT!", Kulah exclaimed flailing her arms as Ember stood behind her gripping Kulahs head with her large claws heating up her head."That's no way to treat a guest Kulah. Mind you manors.", Ember half threatened before turning a cheerful grin to Fantina, "Apologies miss. She be quite bombastic at times. Our leader and the rest of our team haven't returned from their latest mission yet but you are welcome to wait until they arrive."Fantina gives her a puzzled look."GAHHH COME ON ALREADY YOU TRYING TO ROAST MY HEAD?!", Kulah screams trying to pry the Salamanders claw off."AH! Sorry Dear!", Ember stated releasing the Kulah head who immediately makes a mad dash for the large freezer."CHILI PEPPERRRRR!", She yells before dumping her head into the freezer sighing at the frozen goods giving her relief. Madoka looks at the Ocelot in the freezer her butt sticking in the air and steam wafting from the freezer as she silently laments the loss of her blueberry gelato. Hush takes a seat changing the channel to what looked like The Dark Knight and silently but intently watching the Joker police station scene.Suddenly, the doors in the far back open and four people step inside catching Fantina attention."Ah, looks like they're back! Well, why don't you join us?", Ember says stepping aside allowing Fantina in. She then closes the doors behind to Fantina surprise at her escape route being sealed. Ember starts to speak her back turned, "Ah, but don't misunderstand my hospitality for respect. Any other instance...you'd be a pile of ash right now.", Ember spoke in a deep venomous tone as her tail became raptured in flames created shadowy effect around her body with the light of her piercing red eyes glaring down at the Baphomet. Her imposing image unnerving Fantina."I-I understand...", Fantina forced out."Wonderful. Now allow me to get you some tea.", Ember says quickly morphing back to her original demeanor and goes to retrieve the beverage leaving Fantina dumbfounded."We're back baby!", called out what appeared to be a human female doing cartwheels toward the center. She looked to be in her late teens. She had long brown hair, green eyes, she was Caucasian, and had a slim but curvaceous figure. She wore form fitting black yoga pants that showed off her toned thighs and legs and an oversized blue t-shirt with the Mario character 'King Boo' in black design and bright red tongue. She does a cheerleader pose in front of them for heading to the fridge."So how did it go?", Ember inquired walking up to them with a plate of eggs, steak, anf toast."I would say it went well. I took out those rich snobs. That'll teach the rest about not upholding their end of a bargain.", answered a Dark Elf woman in a haughty tone before taking the plate. She had a dark complexion, stern purple eyes, long pointed ears, black shoulder length hair, and wore black backless shirt that showed off her toned midriff and a criss-cross string opening for her D-cups. She wore black jeans with the knees cut out and a silver S-shaped belt buckle fitting nicely around high toned thighs and peach shaped butt, black heeled ankle boots, and black elbow length fingerless vinyl gloves on both arms. She had twin pistols in black holsters on each thigh along with what appeared to be a black whip attached to her back. All of which accentuated her toned and sexy physique and gave her an aura of utter dominance. She struts over to the couch taking a seat next to Hush who was more focused on the movie."Yes, but you also killed the man's wife in the process. She wasn't our target. Nor were those protesters.", said a another woman scolded in a gruff but feminine tone accepting plate stacked with steak from Ember. She was a tall and heavily built easily towering over Kulah by a foot and a half. She had lighly tan complexion, dark yellow eyes, brownish-orange hair, and very muscular physique. However, from her thighs to her feet and from her upper arm downwards she was covered in brownish-orange and black striped fur ending in massive tiger-like paws and large sharp claws. The same theme continued with a long furry tail and small round fluffy ears on top of her head. She wore a dark green cut-off shirt exposing her rock hard abs and and toned midtiff and hugged her massive H-Cup breasts and firm biceps snugly. She wore a sleeveless camo jacket over it and had silver dogtags around her neck. Her dark green weighted cargo pants fit the shape of her muscular thighs and had several small pouch for small items. It also accentuated her wide hips and voluptuous firm rear. There were several scars on her body. The most noticeable being the large gash on her side stopping at her lower abdominal muscles. A Jinko.Fantina narrows her eyes at her."Gimme a break Ranka, she just happened suddenly come into. Plus, it's not my fault those liminals got all violent over this interspecies marriage bill and decided get in the way of business. All I did was clear a bath to objective...with violence.", The Dark Elf defended eating her steak."When will violent protest groups learn that there's a time and a place for everything? I think the humans call it 'Twitter' ", Madoka sarcastically stated."Thank you! Besides we finished the job. Even if a few eggs did get broken, we still get paid.", The Dark Elf woman leans back crossing her legs getting comfortable."That's not the point Vernal! There's a way to do everything. Killing your intended while filtering everything else. That is key to any truly successful assassination.", Ranka stated in an authoritarian tone before brandishing her claws, "I killed the other three that managed to sneak away all with involving unnecessary attention.""Y-You're so cool Ranka-senpai", gushed another woman standing beside Ranka. She had porcelain skin and wore a lavender yukata with flame patterns and dark blue sash wrapped around her waist and white sandals. She had sky blue eyes, platinum blonde neck length hair, but her most notable features were her silky golden fur covering her arms up to her elbow and legs up to her thigh. There were six shiny golden white tipped fox tails sprouting from her back and two triangles fluffy ears on her head. She had a two green jade pins on her sleeves and wore yellow thin frame glasses. She looked to Ranka with admiring eyes. An Inari."Save it, Nekami", Ranka chided making the Inari( named Nekami) tense up nervously, "I wouldn't have had to act if YOU didn't allow them the chance to escape to begin with. What were you even doing at your post.""W-W-W-Well I was...um...", Nekami stuttered nervously not wanting to make eye contact out of shame."Ha! She probably spazzed out again. Am I right Goldy Fox?", Kulah teased rejoining the group holding a frozen water bottle to her head."S-stop calling me that!", Nekami stated blushing in embarassment."Get your kill count up then we'll talk Goldy Fox", Vernal joins in on the teasing."Ranka-senpai!?", Nekami whines as the Jinko crosses her arms and sighs."HAHAAA!", shouted the human female backflipping to the group with a Fanta strawberry in hand, "Come on guys! So what if Nekami sucks at her job? Let's focus on my brand new body. It's young, firm, sexy, and new. Best part is her cherry still ripe and unpopped if ya know what I'm saying."The others give her an annoyed look before Vernal speaks up."Wait, Heather is that the target's daughter? When did you have time to possess her? And what did you do with the body of that red head human girl?""I left it behind some dumbster. Bout time I got a new one though it was starting to fall apart.", Heather says before her body began to glow with white aura. A ghostly woman emerges out of the human body. Her ethereal transparent body shimmered. Though she was technically dead, she had bright green eyes, long silver hair, a porcelain white complexion, and had a light green long sleeve robe with red ribbons as part of her form. In place of legs, there was a swirling, wispy ghost tail. She a sloven expression on her face her mouth contorted in an lewd grin. She raises her hand and little white stringlike appendage appear on the cadaver she controlled and began raising it's arms making it dance like a marionette, "Hahaaa! Look at her go! Let at her go!"Fantina recoils as Ember and the others ( except Hush who continued to watch The Dark Night) give strange looks as the ghost girl goes back into new host body."Heeheeheehee! I finally got me a big boob blondy!", Heather proceeds to firmly grab her own boobs, "I feel like I've died and gone to heaven!""Yeah you died alright. Unfortunately for us, you're not in heaven.", Madoka says plainly.Kulah plobs down next to Vernal, "Hey Vernal, how much DID we make for that mission anyway?""A hundred fifty thousand.", Vernal answers."THE FUCK?! THAT CHEAP?!", Kulah yelled"Calm down! We'll discuss shares as soon as the leader arrives.", Ranka stated."Um, I'd hate to interrupt this episode of Friends, but can I please continue!?", Fantina stated in growing frustration. Ranka, Nekami and the rest turned a surprise gaze to the Baphomet."Ah yeah, forgot about you.", Kulah say."Wha-FANTINA?! When did you get here?!", Ranka stated in a surprised tone as Fantina gives an unamused look."I have a mission for you from Mama Rosé. I'm just waiting for your ENTIRE team to be present.", Fantina answers"Wait, you know this pipsqueak?!", Kulah inquired as the rest ( except Hush) turned to her."Yes...Satella and I met her once when Mama Rosé called us in for a job. She was a former ICEP member that joined the organization back then.", Ranka explained giving a inquisitive look to Fantina."So...I was right to try breaking ever bone in that tiny body. In fact, think that's what I'll do.", Kulah says standing up raising her club overhead but Fantina doesn't flinch. Ranka grabs the club with her large paw as Kulah tries to swing on for it to not even budge."No, Kulah, wait until wait until Satella arrives to hear what she has to say.", Ranka says in an unflinching tone."Yeah, calm your murder boner for a minute.", Heather chided."Shut up Heather! You can't tell my murder boner what to do! I haven't killed anything in two days. I'm killing something. Hnnggghhh!", Kulah stated grunting trying to budge her club her Ranka grip like Excalibur to no avail."Kulah, what did I just tell you?", Ember spoke in a calm tone but behind her the demonic flames of rage were burning. Kulah tenses up releasing the club and sitting down."Eeek ok, ok, I can wait for Satella.""Oh, speaking of which, where is Satella anyway? She was with us when we came back, right?", Nikami inquires curiously."She said she had to 'take care of something real quick' and then left.", Ranka answered."How long will that-", Vernal started only for the doors Fantina entered earlier fly open with a bang. Fantina, Ranka and the rest turn their attention to the pitch black doorway. Even Hush looks away from the Dark Knight to give her attention. Suddenly, something big goes flying out landing on the floor. Fantina eyes widen in shock seeing it was her driver bound and gagged with ropes."Not long.", answered a sinister almost haunting voice. Fantina could sense an oppressive aura seething from the entrance that made ever nerve in her body stand on edge. Footsteps could be heard in the darkness as the aura grew stronger and Fantina could make out the piercing blood red eyes in the darkness. She's definitely seen those eyes before a long time ago.A woman emerges from the darkness. She was tall, her skin was deathly pale, and her luminous red eyes look like the could pierce a heart with just a glare. Her body was voluptuous and curvy but with noticeable muscles on her arms, leg, and toned abdominals. Her blonde neck length hair was styled with triangular bangs and her pointed ears had silver inverted cross earring in them. She was dressed in gothic style attire. Her black leather skirt, grey tight with red daimond line pattern, and black knee length high heeled leather boots accentuated her shapely hips and lovely firm butt. She wore a red skin tight red top underneath a buttoned open blood red long sleeve leather jacket with an opening for her D-cup cleavage to be on display. She wore red leather elbow length gloves on both arms with the fingertips cut off to expose her claws. Her large bat-like wings formed a crown shape on her shoulders and draped along her back like a cape. She carried herself with an air of nobility gazing down at the Baphomet with cold indifference before turning to the man squirming on the floor."I trusted my instincts.", she spoke calmly in a noticeable Romanian accent, "I knew something was off when we returned. As is if something was out of place; doesn't belong. That was when I noticed this black car parked ever so precariously 300 meter facing away from our base. A Buick lacrosse no less. An expensive car like that in a poorer part of the city like this? That certainly turns a head or two.", she says approaching the man who tries to inch away from her before she kneels down over him then turning him on his back and reaching into her pocket, "If things were different, I may have turned a blind eye but you had to get greedy and start taking pictures of our base. Were you hoping for a reward from Mama Rosé if you gave her our true location?", she said removing the rose pin from his shirt.The man squirms seeing her cold, calculating eyes glaring at him."Wait, he was ju-", Fantina before Satella shoots her an glare."I will get to you soon.", Satella warns before turn back to the panicking man, "I hate to tell you this but there only two ways to move up in this business: You earn enough capital and buy your way to the top. Or..."*Stab*Satella stabs her fingers right into the man's chest much to Fantina's shock. , "You create a vacancy yourself.", She finished as the man is quickly drained of a third of the blood in his body reducing him to a partially wrinkled pale shell. Satella sighs exposing her long fangs content at the snack she recieved. She stands up as the man cringes on the floor unable to stand as Fantina watches utter shock.The Vampire turn back to Fantina, "So...it has been a long time Fantina. ""Not long enough it seems.", Fantina answers back.Satella walks a past a still stupified Fantina, "What brings you into our base? I hope this isn't casual visit.""She says she has something important to share with all of us. It's involves a special kind of job", Ranka answers."Ah, well then let's give the young lady our undivided attention.", Satella says going over to her chair in the center and taking her seat."Hey uh...leader? You gonna finish that?", Kulah inquired anxiously pointing to the still cringing man on the floor.Satella looks over her shoulder for a moment, "It is all yours. I'm full for now.""Woo!", Kulah hooted picking up her club happily strutting over to the terribly emaciated man. Fantina gives a disgusted look."So...what is it you have to say that is so confidential that Mama Rosé is making you say it in person?", Satella inquires as Kulah lines the man up while practicing her aim."It's an assassination. There's someone who's been causing a lot of trouble in the Alabama sector of the organization. Mama Rosé is willing to pay very handsomely.", Fantina explains earning a raised eyebrows from a few of them. Kulah raised her club above the man."Of course. This is what we live for after all. We are the unclean, unseen peacekeepers. The bloodsoaked soldiers of virtue.", Satella says in a proud tone as Kulah gleefully raises her club with a murderous gleam in her eyes. She thrusts downwards, "We are..."Splat, goes the man's head as blood pools on the floor."Komanda Monstra"WRSup fam! I hope y'all are doing well. Me? Meh, bout the same from last time. Although I did make some sales yesterday and now have two new happy clients. School still going well too. Got a new engineering project coming up. Mom being put in a care facility for a few weeks to get her strength up before resuming treatment. Life goes on as normal or whatever you want to call normal these days.I hope you enjoyed the chapter and the introduction to Komanda Monstra. Believe me we're gonna see a lot more of Komanda Monstra soon.That's all the time. Stay safe. But before we go let's have a moment of silence for the innocent souls who lost their lives on this and for the families still grieving 19 years later..........Always in our prayers. That's all for now. Peace Fam.
  
    Chapter Text
    ***5 years earlier****The earlier days of the exchange were a tumultuous times in the United States. While some welcomed the new visitors into the country excited that humans weren't the only sentient life on the planets, others feared, reviled, even despised these creatures with some that LOOK so much like humans. Bands of humans took to the streets in protest vandalizing property along with threatening and harassing and humans that decided to take these monsters into their homes. Social media and the internet with individuals vilifying and painting Liminals species in the worst light possible.It wasn't one sided. There were Liminals that actively opposed integration into human society. Whether it be those that chose to isolate themselves in general since humans were...well...pretty goddamn crazy or those that viewed humans as lowly, worthless to begin with and protested any kind of integration seeing it as detrimental to the strength of their races. In retaliation towards violence committed against members of their species by human protesters, individuals of these species would attack them and any other humans they found. Then there were the liminals that actively attacked humans and human owned businesses and, in some cases with more violent species, abducting human males and females for different purposes; mainly as "breeding companions".While ICEP, MON and other law enforcement, and the then recently formed Interspecies Affairs did all they could maintain order amidst the chaos. However, with every hate motivated crime or violent liminal attack the suppressed, 2 more would arise and take it's place.It was amidst the chaos that organizations like the Malone family gained considerable wealth and prominence through black market trafficking of resources and people adding on to the rise of the drug trade. Naturally, underground business such as these attracted attention competitorsnot to mention law enforcement and government officials so special individuals with special skills are needed. They had to be ruthless, unflinching, true Monsters in a world now overrun with monsters.Enter...Satella L. Dascâlu Zöldyck, a 197-year-old Romanian vampire(who barely looks a day over 25) and leader of the band of contract killers known as Komanda Monstra....Mama Rosé sat at on couch in a luxury hotel room suite at the very top floor overlooking much of the nighttime city lights with a glass of vodka in her hand. Several men in red and black suits stood around her as Mozart's Requiem plays in the background. Someone knocks at the door and one of the men answers it. In step three plain average-looking Caucasian human women who walk in to the other side of the room two of them holding bibles as Mama Rosé turns to meet them. She raises a curious eyebrow."Hmm, I don't remember calling room service to bring me up four blonde Beckys.", Mama Rosé smirks as the men giggle at her joke, "Is it done?", she inquires her voice more serious."What ever you mean ma'am? We were just wondering if you want to take a moment to take about our lord sav- .", one of the girls answered in an overly polite tone before getting cut off by Rose'."дерьмо(Bullshit)!", she curses in Russian, "There is no one here but us I made certain of that. Take off those masks of yours it's starting to make me sick.""Da Da (yes yes in Romanian)", spoke the Becky standing in the center before gesturing to the girls on her right. She nods then and raises her hands together in a ninja-like gesture as dark pink demonic symbols appear on her palms. Each of the girls bodies explode in poofs of white smoke revealing their true forms. Satella, Madoka, and Ember stood before the head of the Malone family, "Better? And yes, your competitors in the western district have been neutralized. As of now it is free real estate for your contemporaries to seize control.""What of those ICEP batraki(peons) snooping around my territory?", Mama Rosé inquires."Mien comrades disposed of them as well. It appears MON units are dispatching fewer and fewer becoming units for fear of losing more personnel. Also...", Satella replies as Madoka and Ember steps forward placing the bible's on the glass table. Satella traces a bright red circle on each of them and they both expand and transform into two medium sized black tarps wrapped around two large crescent shaped objects. She unwraps both and Mama Rosé gives a surprised look seeing the pair of sparkling silver horns in one and a pile of bright silver scales, "it seems your lead was correct about MON transporting a rare breed of Lamia. Unfortunately, she vas less than cooperative about coming with us alive like you intended. I'm sure these will fetch a substantial price on the market."Mama Rosé gives an intrigued as her men smile greedily looking between each other in agreement."It is yours. I only ask as compensation, mein comrades and I seize control over the western district including a 45% cut-in on all profits from trade deals.", Satella requests in a diplomatic tone.Mama Rosé gives a ponderous look, "Oh? Are you not satisfied with your regular compensation?""Of course we are but, with all due respect, I believe ve would help expand your influence more if we had territory of our own and allow my team a more steady funds to operate more effectively. I believe ve have earned it. Our skills have been more than beneficial to your goals.", Satella answered." Interesting suggestion. However, I must decline your request.", Mama Rosé answered as Satella gives a surprised look. Mama Rosé stands up swishing her glass of vodka in hand, "You see I am in the process of total expansion which involves having every member of moya sem'ya( my familia) in every facet of society. I need followers I can trust. You can be the smartest, most talented, richest person in this room...it's chush(horseshit) if I cannot trust you. You, Ms. Vampire, and your team are just hired help. Your contract with me is merely THAT. An agreement between boss and worker. Like the sp*cs downtown that are picked up for groundskeeping work. Would you trust one of them in charge of your finances?"Madoka and Ember gives displeased looks as they look to Satella. The Vampire make direct eye contact at Rosé doing he best to restrain her urge to slice her throat right then and there."No, I suppose not.", Satella reluctantly answers."Good, now, as for your compensation, I'm afraid I will have to deduct eighty thousand for this job instead of the agreed upon two hundred.", Mama Rosé spoke as one of the men throws a black duffle bag at Satella feet."What?! Why?! We completed the mission!", Ember stated incredulously as Mama Rosé shot a glare at her while some of her men reach for their guns enchanted with magic bullets. Satella shoots a look toward Ember and she withdraws."Da, but I you requested you return the Lamia ALIVE! Do you realize how long and the resources I'll have to expend just to find a high paying buyer for these parts?! Consider it a small deduction and a lesson to get better control over your subordinates.", Mama Rosé finishes her voice turning venomous near the end before noticing the look in the Vampires eyes, "What's wrong? Do you feel I am being...unfair? If so, you could always find work elsewhere."Satella narrows her eyes at Rosé before sensing a presence above her and teammates. A reddish film with haunting green eyes reveals itself on the ceiling before a single drop lands at her feet eating a whole through the floor like acid. She also senses what feels like a hundred eyes watching them. She could feels it during their mission today even catching a glimpse of a black figure and a single piercing red eye. Satella reluctantly picks up the duffle bag from the floor not breaking eye contact with Rosé before slinging it under her arm."Let's go.", Satella says coldly to her team turning and walking away. Madoka and Ember reluctantly follow behind her glancing back with annoyed expressions as Rosé men proceed to bag examine the fruit of their labor. Satella was about to open the door before Mama Rosé stops her."One more thing!", Rosé stated, "I assume this is every last piece of that snake. Remember, I have eyes...everywhere. I'll know if you try to fuck me. And I WILL. Be. Angry." She says in a very serious as Satella another glimpse of red eyes watching them."Understood.", Satella says unflinchingly before nodding to Madoka. The Kunoichi does her ninja hand sign and white smoke poofs from each of their bodies disguising themselves as the three Beckys again then leaving out the door.Mama Rosé sits pondering to herself before a red slime ball forms next to her looking up with admiring eyes. She smirks then reaches down and pets it much to little red blobs delight. She jingles her empty glass as one of the men hand her a new glass with fresh ice."Haaa, fucking mercenaries.", she sighs enjoying her drink....Later at Komanda Monstra's base..."RAAAGHHH!", Kulah shouts angrily throwing a student desk at a wall smashing the wood to pieces, "THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHIT!"The rest of the team could be seen sitting around the area watching the growling, frustrated Ocelomeh."Kulah, you need to calm down!", Satella says to her."Yeah, freaking out like this isn't going to change anything.", Vernal advises giving a defiant huff."I mean so WHAT if we accidentally killed the snake bitch? Dead or alive they'd be getting what they wanted anyways!", Kulah stated angrily kicking another desk. Hush was passing by with her pet cactus and casually dodges it as it smashes against the wall."Look Kulah! The mission was incomplete! There's no denying that! We were still able to get paid even if it's less than expected.", Ranka spoke in a stern tone crossing her large paws over her chest."Y-Yeah...", Nikami spoke poking her head from behind the couch, "Between the eleven of us i-It's about over ten thousand each.""Shut it fox!", Kulah growls making the five tailed fox duck back behind the couch, "Are you fucking kidding me?! You're OKAY with this crap?!""Come on, it's not like it's anything new.", Heather says currently inhabiting the body of some thicc Goth chick."That's what I mean! The one time we ask for our own territory to work in and she shuts us out, for what? Just so she can put her own damn subordinates and relatives in charge there. It's bad enough they control the casinos and black market deals! I'm so sick of this shit! That damn Fallen Angel's making a killing selling those suped up weapons of hers, the Amphetamine Team live in luxury since they pretty much controls the entire drug trade, even those fucking Hellhound are given free reign to do whatever the hell they want while we have to stay in this dump of a building. All we ever get is chump change in duffle bags straight from the old bitch herself. We're Komanda Monstra! The deadliest group of non-human assassins in the region! Maybe even the COUNTRY! We deserve better than this dammit!", Kulah stated furiously as each of the members say nothing but silently agree with her; especially Satella.Satella couldn't deny how true Kulahs statement was. They've been contracted with the Malones for 3 years now and still aren't making enough to reach their goal. The day the Vampire awakened from her 150 year slumber to find her former castle in ruins and all her treasures pilfered by humans, she had nothing; not even family as she was the LAST member of her clan. With nothing else to do, she discretely traveled around this brand new world seeing how much the humans have developed their society was enough to make her head spin. She took up meager jobs as an assassin utilizing her families hunting skills. In her travels, she met each of the girls under different circumstances but all of them becoming her most loyal subordinates. Life was tough for them trying to make a substantial living but the advent of the human's Exchange program made it easier for them come out of the shadows and advertise their services. Eventually she met the Malones and the money seemed good...at first."Ghaghh! It's just a bunch of blatant nepotism is what it is! They won't give us much because we won't either bend over backwards or we don't produce any kind of resource they can exploit! Damn human pieces of-", Kulah started before Satella cuts her off."KULAH!", the vampire stated in a commanding voice, " That's enough."Kulah tenses feeling the intensity of the Vampires glare on her. She clenches her teeth and fists looking away in frustration"I understand perfectly how you feel, how ALL of you feel! But at the moment ze Malones are only high client and cannot afford to be careless with who ve reveal ourselves too! It's tough but we must continue to bear with it!", Satella stated looking between Ranka, Vernal, Ember and the rest."Our leader is right! We just need to tolerate them a little bit longer!", Ember assures coming up to the ground with some meat cakes she made, "We'll just keep saving saving whatever funds and resources we get and we'll build our own territory just as WE want it!", she encourages handing each of them a meat cake on a plate and a fork.Ember nods to Satella and her a meat cake to which the Vampire gratefully accepts."Mulțumesc( Thank you in Romanian) Ember. This dump az you put it Kulah is only the beginning of our empire. It is our home base that we are building together.", Satella stated garnishing a softened expression from the Ocelomeh."Emphasis on the HOME part. I don't think say it enough but you are all my best friends and I love you all!", Ember stated cheerfully.Vernal and Kulah tense in embarassment with a blush before the latter spoke up, "Ugh, don't be weird Ember. Plus...I didn't even mean it like that alright.", The ocolemeh says biting into the meat cake."Also, 'don't say it enough?', you said it like 9 times this week. Are you ok? You usually only say it about 3 or 4 times a week", Madoka stated picking at her meat cake."I couldn't be better! I'm just saying things will get better for us, I believe in our leader!", Ember stated as Satella gives a surprised look."My sentiments exactly.", Ranka added.Hush steps up to Satella. She gives her a thumbs up with a neutral expression before nodding in approval. Satella sees the trust in the Mantis eyes and nods back.Suddenly, Ember noticed to extra two plates she has. These being specially made with plenty of veggies for their other two members."Oh, that reminds me, has anyone seen Trixie and Carmella?", Ember inquires.Satella and the group finally take notice of their missing members focusing on the their usual spot being a burgundy recliner the two wererabbit girls would share. Trixie, her soft snow-white fur covering her arms and legs stopping at her joints, fluffy ears and cotton tail, porcelain blemishless skin, bright blue eyes, perky C-cups breasts and slim but curvaceous body. Carmella, her smooth chocolate brown fur, fluffy ears and brown tail with white understripe, a caramel complexion Double-D cups, a more toned and muscular physique but luscious curves."Yeah, normally those two wouldn't miss out on claiming their share of the profit.", Madoka admittedly pensively touching her chin."Actually, eavesdropped on them earlier, looked like they were having an argument about something. It seemed important since Trix got a little weepy near the end.", Vernal answered."Really? I-I hope it's nothing too serious.", Nikami spoke"Awww don't worry about it newbie! Those two aDORKable bunnies are head over heals in love with each other!", Heather stated with a lewd smirk, "It's only natural they'd have a lovers spat every once in awhile. I bed they've made up by now and are off make up fuckin' as we speak.", she emphasizes making the 'scissoring' gesture with her hands. Then proceeds to go into vivid, raunchy detail of there sexual deeds much to her teammates growing annoyance."Then Carmel says '~No Trix, that hole is dirty-~' ""SHUT UP HEATHER!", her teammates except ( Satella and Hush) shouted at the ghost girl."In any case, I'm sure they'll be back soon.", Ember assures taking a seat at the couch, "in the meantime, anyone up for some sparring? I've got a little steam I'd like to burn off.", the salamander cracks her knuckles putting on a game face."I could use a few rounds myself.", Ranka spoke standing from her seat cracking her neck as Ember gives her a challenging glare."Oh! Is it ok if I watch?", Nikami inquires."Sure sweety! Feel free to join in too if you want.", Ember stated."Heh, you guys have fun! I'm gonna go blow off some steam with my prize I caught today.", Kulah spoke walking over to a nearby wooden crate and tipping it over with one kick from her foot. Out falls a young man about 19, Caucasian with freckles, and wearing a black ICEP uniform. He was bound and gagged with black ropes and squirms about desperately his cries muffled before stopping looking up the Kulah and the predatory look in her eyes. Tremendous fear overtook the young man as tears welled in his eyes. Kulah picks him up slinging him on her shoulder with very little effort."Hey V, you want in on this? Fine to share but don't go breakin'm TOO early!", Kulah stated roughly digging her claws in the young man's making him yelp from the pain."Hehehe, I'll take you up on that. He's a ripe one, I can tell.", Vernal stated walking up to Kulah and grabbing the terrified human man's face forcing him to look at the hungry dark elf, "~I won't make any promises about breaking him though~.", Vernal spoke licking her lips hungrily."~Oooh! Can I get in on that action?~", Heather spoke seductively twirling her finger around her nipple."No!", "No!", Vernal and Kulah retorted taking the squirming and crying man back to Kulah's room. Heather's ghost form exits the dead goth girls body."They said you couldn't join them.", Madoka says"~Never said I couldn't watch~ Tooodlllllles!", the ghost girl hummed flying off after them. Ember and Ranka shake their heads at the before heading off with Nikami in tow. Satella turns away indifferently deciding to unwind after a long day.Madoka sighs, "Well, I'm off do my rounds and check the defenses. Hopefully they'll be done by the time i'm done. Eh, who am I kidding?", the ninja vanishes with a flash as Satella waves her off. Hush catches up on some game of thrones while Satella sits back in her chair enjoying a wineglass of B positive blood. She refinely sips the crimson liquid then looks to Carmella and Trixies spot unable to shake the troubling feeling she had.She was right to be concerned. Over a week passes and the two wererabbits never returned to their base or even contacted Satella and the others. Satella immediately ordered her team to do some investigating on their whereabouts. After a few days of searching and exhausting all their possible leads, they eventually located them. At least, one of them.Satella is standing with Hush and Ranka in an underground unused parking garage when she recieved a call on her flip phone and sees it's Vernal."Hello? Vernal?", Satella inquires pressing the device to her ear.'Yeah, leader?'"Did you find anything?", Satella inquires further as Hush and Ranka listen in.'Yeah...we did. W-we found Trixie...but...it's...it's not a pretty sight Boss.', Vernal spoke her voice morose and a bit saddened, 'we're in the woods over by Rum Creek. Near the game reserve.'"Understood.", Satella spoke before hanging up. A feeling of dread creeping on her that she tries to suppress. She and Ranka inform the others and they make their way to Vernals location. Satella and the rest were greeted with the grisly sight before them.Standing around the scene with shock and horrified expressions, they gazed upon the remains of Trixie sprawled out on the forest flood. Her body stripped naked with chunks of her flesh missing everywhere on her body even exposing her bones. Her intestines had been ripped right out of Her stomach leaving her rotting innards exposed. Her face had been clawed and ripped apart with her ears ripped right off her head. Necrosis had begun to set in as certain areas had begun to turn a hideous dark blue. The scents was horrendous. Nekami covers her mouth holding back her vomit and Kulah clenches her fists."Vhat. Happened?", Satella demanded looking to Vernal.The Kunoichi steps up hesitantly, "F-From what I could gather...from the marks on her wrists and ankles and the wounds on her body, she had been held down and eaten alive. T-The different bite marks show it was three of them that attacked her...but...", Madoka trails.Vernal takes over, "but the footprints indicate it was most likely five of them. Four being very large canine creatures!", Vernal stated angrilySatella and the rest eyes widen each of their minds turning to the ones likely responsible.Kulah raises her club in both hands with a very angry expression, "I'll kill'em. I'll kill those shitty hell mutts!"Ember steps in front of the Ocelomeh, "KULAH WAIT!""WAIT FOR WHAT?! Those mutts are gonna pay! Then I'm gonna give that old bitch a piece of my mind and fists for not putting a shorter leash on them!", Kulah stated wrenching out of the salamander grasp."Kulah! Calm down...now.", Satella glares threateningly at her. The Ocelomeh freezes feeling a cold oppressive aura from the Vampire. She grips the spikes of her club hard enough to draw blood from her palms."DAMN IT ALLL!", Kulah shouts swinging her bat right through a nearby tree shattering the base into wood chunks before the entire tree falls down with a loud crash. Heather and Nikami tense up at the display of animalistic rage.Satella turns back to Vernal, "Vernal! What about Carmella? Did either of you find her body as well?"Vernal take a second to compose herself, "No. However, look there at that tree.", Vernal points to a treestump that had chains wrapped around it limply draped at the base with a lock hooked at the end link. Madoka kneels down taking the cold steel chains in hand."Judging by the bits of fur and dried blood on the metal, they chained up Carmella up forcing her to watch the entire time.", Madoka spoke as each of the girls gave shocked expressions, "She struggled to break free to save her making the chains cut into her body. She was most likely gagged with duct tape since a found a discarded strip in the foliage. Afterwards I assume she passed out from trauma and they untied her.""Didn't you mention there were FIVE of them?", Satella inquires earning a curious look from Kulah and the others."Yes, I found one other set of prints. This one appearing to be more human-like; specifically that of a child.", Madoka says much to the surprise of the others."I can vouch for that. Look.", Vernal says brushing away some fallen leaves showing the footprint on the footprints on the ground."What in the hell?", Heather spoke."No way they would just have some child here. A shape shifter maybe? Or a halfling?", Ranka added."Whatever the case may be, ve know they still have Carmella so let's continue our search for her.", Satella turns facing Trixies remains, "Gather her remains, lay her to rest properly.", Satella spoke walking away as the others look to her pensively.Ember steps up and says in a serious tone, "Alright, you heard our leader."The others nod agreeingly as Satella glances back with a thoughtful expression.The very next day in the late afternoon. Satella and the others return to their base and were surprised to find several rectangular packages in bright red wrapping paper. They were all stacked up in the center coffee table like Christmas gifts."W-Where the hell did these come from?!", Vernal stated"I'm not sure. Everyone be on your guard!", Satella ordered then turns to Jinko, "Ranka! Ember!""Right!", "Right!", Ranka kneels on one knee pressing her paws firmly to the solid floor and concentrates and Ember focuses as the webbing on her ears glow faint yellow. After a few seconds, Ranka stands up and Embers webbings return to normal."I'm not sensing any other movements throughout the building.", Ranka spoke."And I'm not picking up any foreign heat signatures.", Ember added."Are you two sure?", Kulah skeptically stated, "For all we know they could teleport AND be cold-blooded.""Unlikely combination but whoever did this has plenty of time on their hands. Not only did they avoid our defenses AND neatly stack these packages...it looks like they even did some cleaning", Madoka replied gesturing to the cleaned off furniture and floors."The fuck?! Are they mocking me?!", Ember growls in irritation as her tail heats up with flames, "What's even in those damn packages anyway?!""No idea, I don't see postal sticker or even card just a sticker with a number.", Heather spoke shaking one of the packages trying to hear what's inside before quickly ripping off the paper, "Welp only one way to find out!""Dammit Heather, be a little cautious geez!", Ranka chastises the ghost girls as she rips open the packaging open a"Whoa, check out this weird thing.", Heather stated hold up a thin glass frames with long strip of strange light brown material, "It looks like some kind of modern art."Hush opens up another box presenting a much larger strip of strange light brown material much to the surprise of Stella and the rest. Nikami, Vernal, and Madoka proceed to open the rest."This one looks like one of those fingerless leather gloves", Madoka commented holding up the piece."The hell? This one looks like top half of a gimp mask!", Vernal stated as Satella looks at the strange objects in the glass with sense of dread creeping up her spine."WHOA! THIS ONE LOOKS LIKE TITS!, Heather stated holding up a large frame of leather-like materials that looked like two black nipples pressed against glass. Kulah and Vernal step up next to her."Holy shit it actually does.", Kulah spoke, "What the hell are these thing any-?!""HEEEAHHHH", Nikami screams as one of the frames loudly shatters on the floor and the Inari curls up on the couch in fear."Ouch! The hells wrong with you Nekami?!", Vernal inquired her ears still ringing."L-L-L-Look at that one!", The trembles Inari pointed at the shattered glass and the strange brown material on the floor, "T-That mark...that mark on the upper section! D-Doesn't it look just like the tattoo on Carmella has going down her right thigh?!"Satella and the others give shocked looks as the atmosphere become more intense."All of you! Open up ALL of the glass frames and lay the contents flat on the floor according to the number they came in!", Satella commanded and the team did as instructed. They lay down each piece of strange material according to the number on the package they came in taking note of their smooth but also fleshy consistency. When they were half way done a wave of horror swept through the room at which point only Hush had the stomach to finish this sadistic puzzle."Y-You gotta be kidding me.", Vernal spoke her voice trembling.Madoka gulps nervously a fearful sweat building on her forehead. Heather covered her mouth shaking her head as tears trickled down her cheek."Oh HELL no!", Kulah stated in profound her body shaking as a whirlwind of emotions went through her mind."AHHH I CAN'T! I CAN'T LOOK ANYMORE!", Nikami screams sadly turning away."SHUT THE HELL UP DAMMIT", Ranka shouted in disgust at the fox girl clenching her fists at the sight."No. No. No. No. No.", Ember repeated in anguish refusing to believe what her eyes presented to her.Satella trembling eyes stared down as she clenched her teeth.Hush finishes looking to her team with a small somber frown.Lying on the floor was Carmellas entire body skin with all her fur completely shaved off and ears and tail removed. There were no seem cuts save for at the joints and the inside of the skin had a thin film of viscous purple liquid suggesting that, instead of being skinned alive, her muscle tissue and bones were dissolved from the INSIDE OUT. The contortions on her facial skin also suggest she was conscious throughout the entire process. Vernal then notices a strange object protruding from the upper part of Carmella mouth hole and kneels down to remove it. It was a folded up piece of white paper."Vhat is that? Let me see!", Satella demanded practically snatching it away from the Dark Elf. She quickly unfolds it and two rose petals fall out landing on the floor. Her eyes widen in shock as she began to read.This was punishment. Carmella and Trixie had become dissatisfied with the meager amount of money Rosé was paying and had secretly stealing money from drug deal in one of the Amphetamine teams territories. They were saving all they could to buy fake passports to leave the country to live a more peaceful life; even start a family together. Mama Rosé quickly caught word of this and ordered her guards to eliminate these traitors. She also wanted to make an example to any other would be rebels in her organization, be it human or monster, that SHE had all power."N-no...there's...there's no way in hell any of that's true!", Kulah stated angrily, "It's a lie! There's NO WAY Carmella and Trixie would abandon the group like that!"The others go silent in thought as Kulah looks around at everyone."W-what the hell is wrong with you guys? Say it isn't true!", Kulah demanded."Actually Kulah...now that I think about it, Trixie did mention a couple times how much she wanted to leave this life behind. She made it seem like a joke but...", Vernal admitted."I...remember finding the two of them reading together. I later found out they were books on raising children. I even found these in their room.", Madoka says pulling out two blue covered fake passports with their photos much to Kulah's and the other surprise."Now that I think about it, Carmella got really depressed when I teased about she and Trixie would make adorably deadly children someday...I-If I had known I-", Ember confessed before Satella cuts her off."SO WHAT?! You can't tell me they'd just abandon one family to start a new one!", Kulah shouted in rage as Ranka raises up to calm her down which prompted Vernal to jump in followed by Nekami. The entire group, save for Hush and Satella, began to argue amongst each other."THAT'S ENOUGH!", Satella screams her voice echoing like a demonic roar causing everyone to freeze up seeing her glowing red aura and oppressive aura, "It does not matter their reasons. The two of them are dead now. Ve shall see to their burial first and sort the rest out later. UNDERSTOOD?"The other girls go silent before each voicing their agreement.Some time passes after the incident as Komanda Monstra took their time to grieve the loss of their members after cremating their bodies for their funeral. They created a small memorial shrine on the back of their base where a swing set used to be. It was a large stone structures with two small urns, one brown and one white, with framed photos of Carmella and Trixies and two inscents burning.Satella and the other walk back inside their base each of them having spoke their peace about the couple but now weren't saying a word to each other. Ember somberly goes to make some refreshments for everyone as they all take their seat around their meeting area. Their expressions humdrum and their hearts heavy. Satella could sent the weight in the atmosphere."Everyone.", Satella spoke as only a few of them bother to look up at her, "I...I want you all...to forget about Carmella and Trixie."Kulah and the rest of the team look at her with shocked expressions."They both knew what they were doing so they knew the risks they faced. However, it doesn't mean they deserved fate.", Satella spoke noticing the looks given to her ranging from frustrated to downtrodden to just plain hollow. The Vampire composes herself, "They did not die in vain. Ve now know the true capabilities of the Malones. Ve vill honor them by moving forward."Satella finished as she leaves the group ."S-Satella...where are you going?", Ember inquires in a worried tone hold a tray of hot and meaty snacks."I'll be down in my room for the rest of the day. Do not bother me.", Satella replies with looking at her before she descends the basement stares her team watching as she left. The Vampire lies down to room sitting inside of her large red velveteen lined black casket. She gives an exasperated sigh covering her face with her palm.After these events, the relationship with they had with the Malones changed drastically. They no longer had any directed contact with Mama Rosé instead receiving assignments through anonymous tips and notes left at their base. While Satella and the rest despised it, they still relied on the Malones as clients for decent pay. Satella wanted to hold out hope that someday she would finally reclaim all that she had lost, but how?*****Present Day*****"And that's the current situation right now.", Fantina spoke having finished informing Komanda Monstra of everything that has happened to the organization including the betrayal and death of one of the hellhound along the rest being deported, the execution of Rosé grandson, the death of Azaeli, and Nikolai, one of the organizations top leaders being out of commission and under police watch. She told them about the financial losses and number of subordinates detained as a result.Satella sat with the rest of her team with a surprised but intrigued expression."Interersting. It would seem their organization isn't as stable as I thought if ONE human could cause that much damage. Like the fat kid from the Goonies defeating Tony Montana AHhahahahaa!", Satella chuckles mockingly as Ember and the others join in, " Haha ohhhh how embarrassing but it must be for Rosé right now.""It is what it is. Mama Rosé has agreed to greatly compensate you all. So will you do it?", Fantina inquires not in the mood for joking" HELL NO!", Kulah stated raising from her seat, " I'd say ALL those assholes had it coming! ESPECIALLY those damn dogs! So you can take your little compensation and shove it right up Rosé-!""KULAH!", Ember cuts the Ocelomeh off and the two glare for a second, "That's enough."Kulah turns away crossing her arm before plopping on the couch sulking with her legs crossed."Ahem, thank you Ember.", Satella says standing up then walking towards Fantina, "So, what I understand is that you want us to kill this man and deliver his head as proof. Pray tell, how much does Rosé want for his head?", the Vampire inquires looking down at Fantina like an insect.Fantina stold her ground raising the red suitcase, "I have right here $500,000 cash from Nikolai's personal savings. It's yours right now along with an additional one million after you deliver proof of Bizzell's death."Satella scans the Baphomet face noticing a distinct look in her eye. The eyes of someone with secrets."Hmmm, I do not know why but I sense you are hiding something from us. Mama Rosé would not be so willing to part with such a substantial amount of money so easily.", Satella says narrowing her intense gaze at Fantina making the Baphomet hair on end, "Tell everything you know."Fantina hesitates glancing around at the others that looked like they would all jump her at the slightest command and decides to come clean, "Alright, look, this target isn't like normal humans. There's something...different about him. During the incident with the Fallen Angel and Nikolai he displayed some sort of strange body enhance magic. I don't know what he did to Nikolai but he is now in a very deep coma."Satella and the others listened with genuine surprise and intrigue on their faces as Fantina continues."Furthermore, he appears to be a host of two known liminals. A Greater Devil, likely the one that killed Azaeli, the other...was a purple furred Centaur.", Fantina explains as the assassins show varying degrees of interest, most notably Satella, "You may do what you will with the Devil if she tries to get in your way but DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT kill that Centaur. After doing some research, we found out she is a very rare breed of Centaur called a 'Nightmare'. Mama Rosé wants you to capture her ALIVE and deliver her to this location.", Fantina hands a folded map to Satella.Kulah and the rest eyes widen in surprise at just how much they're will to pay for ONE target. However, while it seemed like good money, they knew how this family was. They knew what kinds of tricks they could pull and were hesitant to accept. They were certain Satella felt the same and would surely decline."Very well...ve accept this mission.", Satella says with a smirk much to the shock of her team. The Vampire takes the briefcase nodding to the Baphomet who nods back."Good. I'll let Mama Rosé know.", Fantina spoke, "Inside the briefcase are fake Alabama state IDs and ICEP passports. ICEP security forces have increased in the region so take extra precaution.""Ve will. There is no need to worry about that.", Satella spoke exchange a knowing glare at Fantina, "Hush! Kindly show Ms. Fantina out of our home."The Mantis nods understandly before gesturing for Fantina to follow. Before they could walk out the door, Satella calls out to her."Oh, Ms. Fantina, one more thing!", Satella stated as the Baphomet turns to her, "Good luck with your little girl pedo cult thing."Fantina shoots her a hateful glare as the Vampire smirks. She turns away cursing under her breath as she now also had to figure out how she was going to get home. The second the door closes Kulah stands up from her seat facing."Ok leader, WHAT THE FUCK?!""Have you forgotten how to treated us?! What they did to Carmella and Trixies?!", Vernal added equally irritated."Satella what were you thinking?! You know we can't trust the Malones.", Ember chimes in as the others voice their discontent much to the Vampire annoyance"ENOUGH!", Satella stated in a firm commanding voice sending a wave of oppressive red aura throughout their being that silence them, "Now, I accepted their offer for a reason. I want them to FEEL like we still need them. In reality, their empire is on the verge of collapse and just like the Romans their time will come to an end."Ember and the other listen to her words their anger now replaced with intrigue.Satella walks over to the concrete steps to getting higher ground, "They stand on the precipice of their downfall and they expect us to destroy the man responsible for putting them there? Yes. Ve will kill our target but VE will have the pleasure of knocking them down ourselve! Rosé and all of her followers ve will destroy them all and takes what was rightfully ours from the start! Ve will build the empire in my-OUR image!", Satella spoke with sheer unfettered conviction garnishing hopeful, admiring gazes among Ember and the others."Ok, but how are we going to do it? Isn't Mama Rosé still under protection from her personal guards?", Ranka inquires."Yeah, plus, even though they lost their guard dogs and their main supplier of superior weapons, that doesn't mean their loyalist won't fight with all they have to keep the familia alive.", Madoka added"Yes, unless they can be properly swayed to abandon the fight.", Satella spoke to confusion of her team, "Remember what she said about our other target, the 'Nightmare'? In my travels, I've come across stories and legends about a phantom-like horse with the power to sway the minds of beings. I can assure they ARE more than mere tales. I encountered one of them before one night on the full moon. I tried to attack them mistaking them for human when I suddenly felt my mind bombarded with strange images and could feel my will to fight draining. It took all of my willpower to regain control. Before I could even realized, they had disappeared as if they never existed. Now, imagine if VE had access to this power to control a multitude of weak willed humans and liminals in the organization."Her team listen to her understanding what she was planning."We're going to use this Nightmares power to destroy the Malones from the inside out. If she refuses, well, we'll make sure she can't refuse. It's time Ve truly live up to our name! Who are we?! ", Satella stated with gravitas in her tone."KOMANDA MONSTRA!", Vernal, Nikami, and Heather voice their enthusiasm respectively jump up from their seats."HELL YEAH! It's about time we showed them who's boss!", Kulah stated raising her club in hand with an excited smirk, "We'll take out that human no problem. No matter what kind weird tricks he's got!""Eh, I'm sure it won't be too hard. Let's do it!", Madoka adds."We're with you all the way leader!", Ranka stated."That goes double for me!", Ember happily beaming at Satella.Hush nods in approval giving a thumbs up and a faint smirk. Satella clenches her fists smirking in determination. She glances in the direction of Carmella and Trixies shrine outside then nods before turning to her comrades."Now then...", Satella says her eyes glowing with a lust for power, "let's get to work."*****Meanwhile*****Caleb was just waking up yawning in fatigue as he notices the morning sun shining through the windows. The young man takes a second to remember where he was. Last night had really, really taken alot out of him. He flushes looking at the Elder Devil stirring in her slumper with her naked body pressed against. Her arms wrapped his chest, her naked breasts pressed against him and her legs interlocked with his own. Memories of last night play in his mind from learning about Camilla's past to...everything they did after waking up. He could feel the sheets sticking to him like a bandaids. It was time to get up...and get cleaned."Camilla? Camiiillllaaa? Wake uuuupp.", Caleb whispers lovingly messing with Camilla's cheek.The Elder Devil eyes flutter open as she groans before looking at Caleb a small grin crossing her lips."Heh, mornin' little devil darlin'.""Mmmm, Buenos dias mi amor (Good morning my love)", Camilla spoke her ruby red eyes sparkling adoringly."That's a new one. What happened to just 'Señor'?", Caleb coyly asks playing with her hair."~Huhu, I believe it suits ju better. Don't ju agree?~", Camilla utters shifting her leg between his groin and mushing her mountainous flesh orbs into his chest making him tense as she brushes her knee against his morning wood. Camilla smirks sultrily at his reaction, "I guess that means ju agree.""Y-yeah, I guess so. Uh we should...get up now.", Caleb spoke shifting at her knee harassment."Awww, so soon? ~I'm sure we have a little for some morning fun~", Camilla blew in his ear snaking her tail around his member making the young man tense much to her satisfaction.'Jesus, she IS like a shark afterall!', Caleb thought feeling his genitals aching from last night's intense session with the affection-starved Devil. He tries to keep his composer and gently removes her tail to her confusion, "That...sounds tempting but I reealllly think these sheets can't take any more of our fun.", Caleb half joked caressing her horn to assure he wasn't displeased, "Besides, we've got a few things to do today."The Elder Devil glances away pensively remembering what she promised last night. She was worried she wasn't prepared to tell them the truth. If she did, how would they react?! Sure Caleb accepts her but he SEEN what she went through. The others...they couldn't fully understand. They-Suddenly, she's snapped from her thoughts feels a hand at her chin. Caleb tilts her head up forcing her to look him in the eyes."Hey. It's going to be ok. I'll be right behind you the entire time, you're among friends remember?", Caleb assured her before taking a bold step by giving her a loving peck on the lips. Camilla eyes widen before a small grin crosses her lips."Ok mi Amor, I trust ju.", Camilla spoke her ruby red eyes sparkling adoringly before kissing him more passionately. The two seperate before raising out of bed. Caleb yanks the sheet off his groin cringing at the sensation as the Elder Devil gets out of bed; her glorious naked flesh bare to the world as goes to her dresser for fresh undergarments. Caleb puts on his pajama bottoms and t-shirt trying not to stare at her heart-shaped latina booty but Camilla catches him flashing a devilish smirk much to his embarassment. He quickly piles up her sheets shuddering in discomfort at the cool, sticky fluids of last night deeds against his palm. He mutters a quiet 'gross' under his breath as Camilla snickers from behind at his reaction. Caleb flashes a fake smile mimicking her laugh."Alright...imma go throw these in the wash while you get a shower. I'll take one after your done.", Caleb says holding the large pile in hand."Oh? Why don't ju join me Señor? It would save water more water.", Camilla offers winking seductively at him."True, buuuut something tells me we'll just come out dirtier than when we came in.", Caleb replies furrowing his eyebrows before turning to open the door."Ah! Don't forget these!", Camilla chortled creating a blue magic seal to levitate her red lingerie from last night. She makes them land on top of the pile of sheets to Caleb surprise. The familiar spicy-sweet scent his senses, "They are quite dirty as well. ~Wash them with care.~", she says in a lascivious tone and a predatory gaze.Caleb gulps, " Yeah...noted.", he spoke hurrying out of the room. Camila sits at her bed with a satisfied expression before taking a deep breath mentally preparing herself for today.Caleb enters the laundry room immediately throwing open the top lid of the washer and stuffing the sheets inside. He hesitates at the lingerie noticing how incredibly damp they were rubbing the lace fabric between his fingers. He kinda felt like a creep but he found it...oddly satisfying. He began to wonder if Moon pie and the others WOULD be accepting if they knew what he now knew. What if..."Oh, good morning Dear.", came the voice of Mirabelle causing Caleb to throw the lingerie in the washer, dump in a generous amount of detergent, slam down the top, and start the cycle ALL in under four seconds before turning to the Centaur leaning casually against the machine with an innocent smile. Mirabelle gives him a puzzled look, "Ummm Dear?""Yeah, hey, good morning Moon pie...what's...up?", Caleb says trying to look natural and failing."N-nothing in particular...um...how was...your night with Camilla?", Mirabelle inquired carefully not wanting him to think her upset but also genuinely." Good, good, it was...good.", Caleb quickly answered rubbing the back of his head."Good.", Mirabelle replies.An awkward silence befell the room as only the sound of the washing machine kept it from being too silent. The two of them remained like this for several seconds before their consciences began to licking violently at their nerves."Dear we need to talk!", "Moon pie we need to talk!", the two blurted out simultaneously. They caught themselves in surprise before sharing an embarrassed giggle."Honestly, I think it's better if everyone hears this.", Caleb says with a sheepish smirk."Yes...I agree.", Mirabelle replies coyly.The two of them give each other knowing looks before simultaneously stating..."Family meeting." "Family meeting""But first, I...really need a shower.", Caleb says pulling the hem of his shirt as Mirabelle raises an eyebrow..........WRWhat's good fam! I hope you're all doing well. Me? Well...I'm getting there, slowly but I'm getting there. Had a bit of a health scare when I started showing Covid symptoms, but fortunately tests came back negative. Long story short, I'm never attempting to make homemade broiled oysters again. Apartment situation is still a challenge and adapting to new routine for mom's home health treatments along with my college classes and online business so I still have my hands full.Luckily any little bit of free time I have I commit to writing. Hope you guys enjoyed the chapter and Komanda Monstra. In case you haven't figured it out yet, they are based off of La Squadra from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. Love the franchise, had to make a monster girl version. Somebody had to do it. It had to be done!Well, that's all for now. PEACE FAM!
  
    Chapter Text
    Chapter 36: Cards on the TableA few hours pass this morning in the Bizzell household. Caleb and each of the girls had their baths, got dressed, and enjoyed a nice, hearty breakfast prepared by the food gurus Caleb and Camilla. Of course, the Zyklons joined them for breakfast prior to completing their routine security check around the property.Caleb, Mirabelle and Camilla informed Lyca and the Zyklons of the important matters they needed to discuss. They decided to allow Mirabelle to go first both because Caleb could almost feel her worries weighing on her and also because he could sense Camilla still needed extra time to mentally prepare herself.Now every one was seated around the living room with Caleb taking a chair from the dining room and everyone sitting on the couch a recliner."Alright Boss, everybody's present. What's this meeting of the 'Knights of the Round Coffee table' all about?", Zwei inquired in a facicious tone."I suppose that makes you sir PERVcival.", Drei quips before Zwei shoots a nervous glare."Why's that?", Caleb inquires raising an eyebrow."Well-", Drei started before Zwei catches her."AH BUHBUHBUH! It's nothing Boss! Just a little inside joke. Now then you were saying?", Zwei finished flashing a smile hiding her rosy cheeks as Ein gives her a skeptical look and Drei lightly shakes her head.Caleb gives an inquisitive look before dismissing whatever that was, " Anyway, Moon Pie? You...ready?""Y-Yes Dear.", the Centaur replies raising up slightly as the others turn their attention to her, "I'm sure you've notices, I'm sure all of you noticed that Caleb is going through...changes.""That's...a bit of an understatement.", Zwei expressed"I agree, it's not everyday you meet humans with magical abiiities.", Ein added." At least legit magic. Not like cold reading, card tricks, or Chris Angel-type shit.", Drei quips sarcastically." Guys, we get it, OK?", Caleb hushes them, "But yeah... Moon Pie it's...really hard to ignore.""Dear I...I'm very worried about you! I don't fully understand how but...somehow your gaining magical abilities. MY abilities. I don't know why they're manifesting right now but I'm afraid of what this means for you or what will happen if you're unable to control them. Or what will happen if another incident like yesterday occurs and other humans begin looking at you as some kind of freak! ", Mirabelle says clutching the hem of her skirt securely."That...is a possibility. And if I'm being honest, it did cross my mind once or twice.", Caleb admitted touching the back of his head." But you're not a freak Chief! How dare they say that about you?!", Lyca stated with a low snarl."Purely hypothetical there Lycs.", Zwei informs as the Werewolf tilts her head questioningly." Hahh, I'm afraid of what I'm involuntarily turning you into!", Mirabelle continued, "What happens if Sterling finds out?! What happens when other humans find out about you?! I may have ruined your life!", Mirabelle stated looking down in tribulation as she trembled holding back her tears and gripping her skirt. Caleb walks over kneels down on one knee in front of her so she could see him and gently takes her hand." Moon Pie, Moon Pie you didn't ruin anyone's life.", Caleb assures her, "I don't know...what's happening to me but...but I can't be changing THAT much since I still feel like the same guy. Besides I'm getting the hang of the teleporting at least. With practice, I'm sure I can control whatever else might pop up.""But you don't know when or how they'll pop up.", Drei spoke up, "You have to understand what triggers them to begin with such as what you felt when you conjured the barrier or first became black Nightcrawler. Have you had any other abilities suddenly awaken since we returned yesterday?"Caleb pauses noticing Mirabelle giving him an expectant look then noticing Camilla shifting nervously. He sighs, "Actually...I did. Last night, night I...found I...have the ability to enter dreams when...I entered Camilla's dreams last night."Mirabelle, Lyca, and the Zyklons gives varying degrees of shock and interest."W-What?", Mirabelle softly asks in surprise, "B-But how?""I don't know myself. All I know is I woke up to Camilla tossing and turning in her sleep then I tried to wake her up and...I just...it felt like everything went numb and I just found myself in her mind.", Caleb says as Camilla grips the armchair securely."So...you also have Ms. Marequine's ability to enter and possibly manipulate dreams?", Ein inquires.Caleb gives a surprised look, "Wait, so, you already know about Moon pie's power?""Well duhhh we're ICEP agents and YOUR personal bodyguards. Why would we NOT know about it? That's just stupid.", Zwei says in an incredulous tone."Yeah...that makes sense.", Caleb admits."Not to me!", Lyca stated getting everyone's attention, "Did everyone know about it EXCEPT me?!""What n-well...kinda but to be fair I just told Camilla about it last night so up until then, you AND Camilla didn't know so...", Caleb explained seeing the She-wolf eyeing him seriously."Why though?! I thinks it's amazing! Why WOULDN'T you tell us?! A pack is only at its strongest when we understand each others strengths and weaknesses. Didn't you guys trust us?", Lyca stated her tone becoming more somber and tail tucking between her legs.Caleb and Mirabelle feel a pang of guilt."Of course we trust you Lyca, and Camilla as well. You have to understand it's important we keep my ability a secret.", Mirabelle says in a gentle but reassuring tone."There's plenty of bad people out there that would use Moon pie's power to do who knows what. We just wanted to be extra careful. We're sorry for keeping you guys in the dark for so long. You forgive us?", Caleb says gently tilting the She-wolf's head up."I forgive you and it make perfect sense not to let potential enemies know about packs abilities. I just...don't like secrets between us. We're a family after all.", Lyca says in a fervent tone bringing a smile to Mirabelle and the others faces."Hehe well said Lyca. And...you're right we shouldn't have secrets. We should...be up front with each other about who we are.", Caleb muses looking around as Zwei tenses slightly. He looks to Camilla who seemed hesitant so he decided to press on in her stead, "Guys, last night, I...didn't just go into Camilla's dreams."Mirabelle and the others gave skeptical looks."W-what do you mean Dear?", Mirabelle inquires glancing at Camilla."I also saw her memories. I learned so much about her...more than I...EVER thought I would.", Caleb pauses noticing the curious looks from Mirabelle, Lyca, and the Zyklons then sighs, "I bring this up because there's some things you all need to know abo-""Senor!", Camilla stated shooting up from her chair then walking to his side laying a hand to his shoulder with a certain expression, "Gracias. I can take it from here."Caleb nods then takes a seat as everyone now shifts their attention to the Elder Devil stamding before them. Camilla takes a deep breath."Ms. Sartana?", Ein inquires noticing Camilla unusually apprehensive demeanor."What Señor tells ju is true. He now knows of my...entire past; including...the terrible things I have done and ever awful experience I have endured. Yet...he still accepted me. I don't understand it and...it scares me. It scares me because I don't feel I deserve it.", Camilla pours out her heart as Caleb is especially taken aback by her tone that felt quite familliar for him and the other girls listen intently, "However, I also know I cannot continue on living here while keeping all of ju in the dark about...WHO I am.""It's ok Cami, you can tell us. We don't need to keep secrets from each other remember?", Lyca affirms."I-Indeed. You are our friend Camilla. Whatever is weighing on you, we shall help you remove it.", Mirabelle added supportingly as Caleb gives an approving grin. Ein and her sisters solemnly agree with them.A small grin crosses the Elder Devil lips for a moment."Hahhh, alright, I will start in the beginning.", Camilla says to them before beginning to lay all her cards on the table....1 hour later...Silence, utter, shocked silence befell the room. Mirabelle, Lyca, the Zyklons all speechless staring as Camilla with a very different look in their eye than before. It was a combination of fear, caution, sadness, and a whole slew of other emotions rushing through each of their minds after hearing the Elder Devil's story.Camilla held nothing back when describing her life in her birth clan, surviving with her mother in the Mexican deserts, her time in Abbadickhead's clan, to being trafficked with the other Devils. She reluctantly told them of the people she's killed; human AND Liminal alike, and the physical and sexual abuse she experienced in the clan and the cartel. At some points it was hard for her to continue so Caleb help comfort her to continue.After finishing, Camilla sat back down eliciting a long tired sigh from having to recount her past. Even Caleb was feeling exhausted having to experience it all again. Caleb looks around his heart wretching seeing the girls expressions. Lyca with tears in her eyes and ears drooped downward making low canine whimpers. Mirabelle trembling hand clutching her chest and tears trickled down her cheeks. Zwei was utterly speechless with a sorrowful expression on her face. Ein looked at the Elder Devil with complete befuddlement and despondence. Even Drei couldn't anticipate HOW heartbreaking her story would be."Camilla...I...I...", Mirabelle started unsure how to responds and instead falls silent again unable to make proper eye contact with her."I understand, Señora.", Camilla spoke, "It is...alot to process I am sure.""Yeah, no shit. Goddamn!", Zwei chided before touching her forehead, "I mean just...goddamn.""Believe me, I perfectly relate and understand that reaction.", Caleb added as Camilla turn to him dubiously forcing him to elaborate, "It IS alot, and I mean, ALOT to take in and...Camilla was very brave in coming forward with all of you like this. Thank you Camilla.""S-Si Señor...", Camilla spoke starting to grow concerned over their surprisingly limited reactions. That was until Lyca lunges upward wrapping the Elder Devil in a hug nuzzling her head between her breasts sobbing.."I'M SO SORRY CAMI!", Lyca bawled looking up a the Elder Devil tears streaming down her face, "YOU MUST HAVE BEEN SO LONELY AND ANGRY FOR SO LONG. No wonder you always seemed so sad! WAHAHAAAHAAAA!"Camilla pauses before reaching her arms up to console the crying She-wolf."Stop!", Ein instinctively stated raising from her seat making Camilla cease her motion as Lyca pulls away and the others turn to the wind weasel curiously, "I-I mean...I don't think you should...you know..."Camilla gives her a shocked look, "What? Ju don't think I should WHAT?""Yes, KINDLY elaborate Ein.", Caleb stated in an incredulous tone."Look, it's not what either of you think! It's just...given what you've told us...sigh I'm only taking precaution.", Ein confessed."Precaution from what?! Do you think Camilla's a danger to us?!", Caleb stated."Can you, based on what you said you've SEEN, deny that?", Drei rebutled jumping in, "Of course, by all accounts, most Liminals can be dangerous to humans but her ESPECIALLY since by her own admission she has KILLED humans; at times in cold blood.""Honestly, it's shocking ICEP let her be your homestay AT ALL with a background THAT egregious.", Zwei chided in disbelief."The only logical answer to why she was allowed to do so is she purposely withheld the details of her history; which IS a criminal offense especially in this country.", Ein explained, "There is no way anyone will allow her to stay here."A feeling of distress sweeps through Camilla, Caleb, Lyca and Mirabelle at the idea of never seeing Camilla again."NO WAY! I won't let them take Camilla or ANY member of our pack away!", Lyca stated fervently raising her arms sheilding Camilla to her surprise. Zwei looks away despondently."So now what, huh? You guys going to tell ICEP? Get her deported KNOWING she has nowhere to go?! Take away the ONE thing that makes her feel normal?!", Caleb demanded answers walking up to them."Dear-", Mirabelle spoke."NO!", Caleb shouted making the Centaur and some of the others flinch in surprise. He notices her hurt expression, "...Moon pie, I...I didn't mean...""Mr. Bizzell, please understand we're only considering your and your homestay's safety.", Ein says plainly, "That includes protecting you all from yourselves."Camilla gulps feeling as if her world was beginning to swallow itself in darkness and uncertainty. She looks to the ones causing her distress of losing her home. Instinctively, her hand twitches while a tiny red magic seals repeatedly forms and unforms in her palm as she internally debates with herself."You've noticed Ms. Camilla's...temperament I'm sure. I personally can list several instances where she has come dangerously close to attacking or even killing a person because they enraged her; one of whom was Agent Sterling. Every time she was stopped by one of US. Imagine if she were harassed by a bigoted person and no one was around to stop her. Would she have enough restraint to stop herself? Or would she default to old habits?", Drei says turning her eyes to the Elder Devil, "Even now, Ms. Camilla, I bet you're debating whether to get rid of me and my sisters and run away with as many of your loved ones as possible or...do nothing and lose your home."Camilla gives a shocked look as the Caleb and the girls turn to the Elder Devil hoping what she said wasn't true. Camilla completely dissipates the seal looking downward in defeat. She begins to lowly giggle to the surprise of the others."Heheheheheh. I suppose your right. Old habits have a way of not dying quickly. Though, I doubt ju could EVER understand why that habit formed to begin with!", Camilla spoke bitterly glaring at the weasels, "Ju haven't experienced a mere FRACTION of what I've been through! You've never had to dirty your hands with the blood of vile, contemptible swine as I have! Besides, they all deserved to die! DO NOT PRETEND AS IF JU COULD EVER UNDERSTAND ME!", she spat at Ein and her sisters. The three weasels eyes become stern as shadow casts over their emerald green eyes."Camilla, they didn't-", Caleb started before being interrupted"No! Mr. Bizzell, no.", Ein says shooting a look that told him to let her handle it. The tallest of the Kamaitachi raises from her seat in front of the Elder Devil. Camilla piercing red eyes staring back at Ein's unflinching green ones, "What was that you said about...'never having to dirty our hands with blood' ?""Jes...that is ri-""WELL SHUT UP CUZ YOUR WRONG!", Zwei shouted glaring angrilly at the Elder Devil to the latters surprise."We have killed people before; both liminal...and human. That was part of our job in Beijing's MON devision. In fact, it's one of the specialties of our clan.", Drei spoke coldly.Camilla along with Caleb, Lyca, and Mirabelle turn to them with surprised looks."Y-You guys...what?", Caleb utters"Boss, come on, you really that surprised? When you first met us, what did you think it meant when Agent Sterling said we 'helped suppress human and liminal terrorist groups'?", Zwei says nonchalantly resting her arms behind her head."...W-why didn't you guys ever tell us?", Mirabelle suspiciously inquires."Oh yeah, that's a good conversation starter. '~Hi, I'm Drei Zyklon! I killed fiddy men! Literally!~' ", Drei spoke doing her sarcastic Cotton Hill impression."But, ya know, NOT literally since we...don't really keep track of...THAT sorta thing. Not anymore at-", Zwei shamefully admitted to Lyca and the other's surprise."Ok, thank you SISTERS!", Ein commended before facing Camilla, "The point IS miss Sartana is that we understand where your coming from on that level. Taking a life is NEVER easy and most cases it can scar a person deeply. However, it's STILL a necessary, albeit VERY rare, part of life. YOU'VE been exposed to it so much over the decades that you've internalized it AS a part of life period! These aren't the days of wagon trains and cowboys! You CAN'T just kill someone that endangers, threatens, or even agitate you just because you can! Do you expect to do away with every less than polite human or cantankerous liminal that crosses your PATH?!""Ghaa, so what?! Ju want me to just STAND OR SIT there and take it?! No matter how much they curse or spit at me I am supposed to lie down and show mi belly?!", Camilla stated angrily as Caleb tries to step in before feeling Mirabelle pull his hand giving him a pleading look."That's NOT what we mean and you know it!", Ein retorted firmly holding her ground, "And you know what I think I finally figured your problem!""Oh really?! What's mi problema Miss Weasel?!", Camilla snarled glared daggers at Ein."Stop fighting you two!", Lyca demanded as tears well in her eyes. Zwei steps in front of her, to the She-wolf surprise. Zwei shakes her head giving her a serious look."Your PROBLEM, Ms. Sartana, is you've let your hate control your ability to recognize REAL threats! You've subconsciously rooted yourself in the past and developed tunnel vision. You think that killing is the SAME as taking a life!", Ein reprimanded."Ju are going to stand there and tell me what ju have done isn't the same.", Camilla stated incredulously" No it isn't. When I take the life of a target...i've resolved in my mind that they are to die based solely on their intent. If they have intention to harm, kill, or persecute others or inciting others to do the same and spread their malicious intent, my sisters and I have no choice but to put them down for good. It's never about hate, pleasure, revenge, personal history, monetary gain, or...who the target is as a person. When it's done, it's done. We still...remember a targets face, we try not to forget, we just acknowledge them and move on.", Ein explained as her sisters look to her with neutral yet attentive expressions. Caleb and the girls listen. Despite the nature of her explanation, Caleb couldn't help finding it oddly reasonable. Ein then gives Camilla a stern, "Then there's you."Camilla eyes widen focusing on the weasel but not responding."When you kill, I bet you put all of your emotions into it.", Ein says looking the Elder Devil right in the eye, "All your malice and anger toward these people you see as irredeemable swine."Drei then jumps in, "By always putting your feelings desire into killing your enemy, you've made it easy for them to hurt you long after they're dead. It's like what our mothers always told us, "If you intend to kill in anger and malice in your heart, do it with TWO blades. One for your targets neck, the other to cut off the arm that did the killing. Both of you will be dead soon but only one of you will suffer longer""You learned to take EVERY kill personally and have become too resentful to realize when you've won! Even when the fight is over!", Ein chastised seeing the faint guilt in Camilla's eyesCamilla looks down in thought wanting to deny any of what they say is true; but she couldn't. The more she thought about it the more she realizes how long she's been carrying a grudge against the people she's killed. The countless sleepless nights she experienced while telling herself 'they deserved it.'"Ok, you guys, that's enough.", Caleb intervenes not wanting them to gang up on Camilla, "I don't really like the subject of...how to feel after killing someone but I appreciate what you guys are trying to get through to her. However, I said that I addressed this with Camilla last night. All she needs is some self-control. Camilla is trying to change.""I'm afraid that's only part of it sir.", Ein stated much to the confusion of Camilla, Caleb and the others, "Her experiences through the decades have imbedded vicious habits that would take more than just self-control to break. First off, she has to really want to change. It's easy to SAY it but can she actually do it?"Caleb tries to retort but gives no answer. He then looks to Camilla noticing to uncertain and slightly nervous demeanor she had."Whatsmore, CAN you all still accept her? Knowing the very real possibility of her losing and accidentally injuring or possibly killing one of you?", Drei inquires much to the shock of Caleb, Lyca, and Mirabelle.The Elder Devil looks them with a sense of dread creeping into her heart. She notices their uncertain expressions and feels her heart aching.Caleb clenches his fist taking a deep, "Yes..."Mirabelle, Lyca, the Zyklons and especially Camilla look to him in surprise"I'll tell you all what I told her. I know she's dangerous. I know what she's done and is capable of doing. I know I'm even a little afraid of her now.", Caleb spoke in a low serious tone then looks right at Camilla, "But I still love her. I still appreciate all the great things about her. I still want her in my life and have NO intention of getting of her. And the same applies to moon pie and Lyca!"Camilla stares at wordlessly feeling her heart flutter as the Zyklons and Mirabelle look on with surprise."T-That's right!", Lyca jumps in, "Cami made a lot of mistakes growing up. We all have at some point right? It doesn't make me love her any less either. Besides, I've never sensed her wanting to hurt any of us ever! She's a caring and protective person and I'm proud to have her as a packmate."Camilla gives the She-wolf a small grin. Zwei sighs playfully shaking her head at Lyca's...Lyca-ness."What about you Moon pie?", Caleb inquires to her making the Centaur flinch a bit now being put on the spot. Mirabelle looks to Caleb to Camilla who shamefully averts her gaze.The Nightmare sighs, "Ms. Sartana...I cannot sit here and lie by saying my opinion of you hasn't changed. Even before learning of your past, I was always cautious of you. At first out of fear you take Dear from me. Then, after the kurfuffle with that Angel I realized you were a dangerous, violent, angry individual. I became wary of you for a new reason I suppose. Now that I understand what you truly are and what you're capable of, it makes me fearful for Dear and Lyca's safety, as well as my own.", Mirabelle answersCaleb and Lyca give each other surprised looks as Camilla looks away with a somber frown."...However... *zoom*", Mirabelle emphasizes raising to her hoove before teleporting next to Camilla to the Elder Devil and the others surprise."S-Senora?!", Camilla replied in confusion."Ms. Marequine, what are you do-?", Ein asks before Mirabelle cuts her off."Ms. Ein, you mentioned earlier about Camilla's 'vicious habits that have been ingrained in her over the years' and self-control would be enough to stave them off? I assume that includes a natural reflex to attack when startled.", Mirabelle says looking to Ein to which the wind weasel affirms, "If that were the case, wouldn't she have defended herself instinctively the second I teleported to her? "Ein and Zwei give her a thoughtful look as Drei raises an intrigued eyebrow and Camilla and Caleb look to Mirabelle curiously."I...suppose so.", Ein answers reluctantly."I believe she has more self-control than we realize.", Mirabelle says in a serious tone before turning to Camilla, "Listen, Camilla...I...I can never, NEVER approve of how you behaved or the awful things you've done. However, I know if I experienced a quarter of that pain, loneliness, and humiliation on top of losing your only family...I can't fathom what I would have done. I probably would have gone utterly mad...just from loneliness.", Mirabelle confesses with a forlorn expression."Senora..", Camilla utters softly.Mirabelle then gently takes Camilla hands much to her surprise, "And yet, in spite of everything, you are still one of the kindest souls I have met. You've saved my life, Lyca's and Dear's without a second thought. Any time you were violent or ruthless around us, your heart was always on protecting the ones you care deeply for. You're a good person Camilla and, in spite of the trauma you endured, I...I still consider my friend.", Mirabelle expresses as Camilla blushes slightly seeing the Centaur warm, accepting purple eyes.Camilla smiles warmly at her, "Gracias, Señora. I am happy ju are mi amiga as well."Ein watches the display looking to her sisters who return her expression; each of them collectively thinking the same thing."Well said, the both of you.", Caleb chimes going to their side as Lyca joins as well, "It matter who you were last year, 10 years ago, or in 1833, what matters is who you are now and who you wanna be after that? We're all still moving forward and that's what I think matters most. Camilla...you do have some stuff about yourself you have to work on but we'll help you every step of the way.""Indeed!", Mirabelle agreed."I got'cher back Cami!", Lyca stated pounding her chest with her fist. The Elder Devil felt a warmth grow within her she hadn't felt in quite a long time.The Elder Devil eyes dart between her Destined one and her amigas/co-lovers realizing that, for the first time in a long time, she truly has a home. Her days of running, hiding, fighting to survive were over. The people before her accept her, regardless of her past and her tendencies. She has to blink a few times making sure it's not a dream before she suddenly feels something warm and wet run down her cheeks. She touches her face surprised to find her tears flowing ceaselessly down her cheeks as she chokes back her sobs. Her legs feel weak before eventually collapsing to the floor on her knees.Caleb and Lyca catch her as Mirabelle kneels down consoling the weeping Devil woman. Ein and her sisters watch the scene with deep contemplation.Caleb turns to Ein and her sisters, "Ein, I know you and your sisters are just watching out for us. You're worried about the danger Camilla poses when she's around us. But you heard it from us, we're NOT abandoning her. We're going to help her. Camilla wants to change and as her host and her boyfriend it's my job to support her. Not just me, Moon pie and Lyca are here for her. So...I ask you three...please give her that chance."Ein and her sisters look between each other before seeing the conviction on Mirabelle, Lyca, and Caleb face then noticing Camilla nervously anticipating their answer. Drei then shrugs and Zwei simply nods.Ein sighs heavily before turning back to Camilla, "Ms. Sartana...in any other circumstance we would not allow your status as a homestay to continue. We will make an exception for you once since can't legally remove you from the household against the host's wishes. BUT, if we EVER at any given time decide that you are a true threat to the lives of this household or anyone outside of it be they human OR liminal, you WILL be dealt with...immediately. DO. YOU. UNDERSTAND.", Ein warns much to Camilla being taken aback seeing the coldness in the weasel's eyes.Camilla dries her tears, "J-Jes. I understand."Ein exhales as her demeanor softens, "Good, I'm glad.",Ein offers her hand to the Elder Devil who looks up at her now kinder eyes, "Now, come on, stand up. I thought you were a proud and strong Elder Devil.", she teasesCamilla eyes widen then smirks before accepting her hand standing up, "Heh, I am a bit surprised ju noticed from way up on that moral high ground of yours.""Yeah well, sometimes you can't really see what your looking for from high up.", Ein replies returning a smile.Caleb then steps up, "So...are you and your sisters going to inform ICEP and Sterling about any of this?", he inquires cautiously.Camilla, Mirabelle, and Lyca look to the Zyklons who remain silent for a moment."Typically, yes we should.", Zwei answered plainly, "buuuut...""Buuut...", Drei picks up where she trails, "It's not seventy plus year old testimonial of her violent acts is enough evidence to support that Ms. Camilla is NOW a danger to the Mr. Bizzell and the general public. Since they were committed before ICEP even EXISTED...", Drei trails giving Ein an urging look."Sigh, yeah that's kind of the problem with liminals with high longevity, like Dragons or Vampires, it's difficult to gauge their appropriations based on their actions BEFORE ICEP laws were in afffect. However, as long as they are considered "rehabilitated" or "seeking rehabilitation" then...they are allowed to remain under host care.", Ein admitted placing her hands to her hips before giving Caleb a stern look, "Do you agree that Ms. Camilla is seeking rehabilitation under Mr. Bizzell care?""Yes I do.", Caleb affirms taking Camilla's hand as she does the same."Then I suppose that's good enough for us, but remember-", Ein started again"Sis, come on, they get it already!", Drei cuts her off from repeating herself."Yeah stop beating a dead horse already.", Zwei added before noticing Mirabelle give her a surprised look, "Uhh no offense to any equestrian bodied individuals.""Alright, yeah, but for real though. We truly appreciate what you guys are doing for us. Don't worry, we won't give you any reason to doubt Camilla. Right Camilla?", Caleb says and Camilla nods assuringly, "See? We totally got this.", he emphasizes fists on hips pushing his chest out slightly trying to look more confident.Mirabelle giggles at his silly display as Camilla and Lyca even Zwei do the same. Caleb looks between them questioningly before refocusing on Ein."So we have a deal?", Caleb says offering his hand to her.Ein sighs before reluctantly taking his hand, "I hope you know what you're doing.""I almost never do. Doesn't mean I won't do my best.", Caleb replies admittedly earning.Ein gives an unamused look, "Well it appears we now have another secret to withhold from our superiors.""Eh, no more than any American finance worker.", Drei commented."Plus, it's not like we won't do our best to ensure he keeps his word.", Zwei pointed out shooting a knowing expression at Caleb, "Think of it like...an extra layer to our job as his bodyguards.""I...guess that is true.", Ein softly spoke appreciating her sister trying to cheer her up."Perfect. Glad we got that all cleared up.", Caleb says taking a seat smiling at Camilla confirming that all was well much to Elder Devil's comfort who sits adjacent to him, "Aaand I don't have to finish up a project for work until later so...who wants to help me procrastinate?""~I'll get us some procrastination munch(British for snacks)~ ", Mirabelle happily chimes before teleporting to kitchen rummaging through cabinets."Thanks bae! Lyca, wanna play some Crosstag?", Caleb invited picking up the PS4 controller from the coffee table."Normally, heck yeah, buuut I'm kinda curious about something.", Lyca answered touching her thoughtfully."Hm? What's that?", Caleb inquires.Lyca whips around to Zwei slightly startling the wind weasel, "Zwei, you and your sisters HAVE killed bad people right?! How bad were they? What did they do?"Caleb and the rest were taken aback by the question. Zwei pauses unsure how to answer seeing the curious but slightly hesitant look in the She wolf eyes."Now, Lyca..", Caleb started trying to reign her in."I know it's a weird and...uncomfortable thing to ask but I just want to know more about you guys! I want to really understand who guys are.", Lyca spoke honestly."I must admit, I AM curious about it as well.", Camilla added leaning against the couch. Caleb gives her a look."Well...", Zwei trails scratching her head glancing between her sisters and Lyca as Mirabelle returns with a bowl full of Cheez-it snack mix and strawberry wafer cookies."Honestly, it's not that much to tell.", Ein spoke up not wanting to get into it, "It's not that worth getting in to.""Awww, don't say that. I bet you guys have done lots of cool missions and stuff.", Lyca urges."Come on girls, I'm sure they don't want to talk about that stuff right now.", Caleb says not wanting to have another conversation about death and killing people."Sir, come on, you're gonna sit there and say you're not a little curious.", Drei rebutled raising a knowing eyebrow."Well...I won't deny that...I feel like we should move away from the morbid stuff for awhile.", Caleb replies as Mirabelle teleports in placing the snacks on the coffee table to which Zwei and Lyca immediately begin munching on the snack mix."I agree. I am a tad curious myself but would prefer to avoid more...morose subjects.", Mirabelle admitted seating herself next to Caleb."Awww don't be like that you two. Feed that morbid curiosity! Plus, like lycs said, can't hurt to know more about the folks who are in charge of your well-being.", Zwei points out popping a Cheetos in her mouth."Everyone sat through mi life story with little problema Señor.", Camilla expressed using a blue magic seal to levitate five wafer cookies toward her, "Besides, I doubt they have done anything...too extreme."Ein and her sisters turn to the Demoness feeling their pride being attacked."Camilla don't-", Caleb started before Ein cuts him off."Nonono Mr. Bizzell, it's fine.", Ein stated eyes focused on Camilla who realizes she just pulled a pin on a grenade, "Obviously, we should make it clear who we are. We're more than happy to share some missions we've done; excluding confidential information of course. In fact, how about we start with our less...unsavory targets and work our way up.", Ein emphasizes giving a challenging smirk to Camilla."Your flexing could use some work.", Drei quipped before Ein pouts in annoyance."Sweet! So let me tell you guys about these traffickers in BANGKOK!", Zwei stated emphatically beginning her story while Ein made sure she didn't give out too much detail.Caleb sighs realizing he was outvoted before noticing Mirabelle shrugging then reaching to her side and presenting him a DD Pepper with a smile. Caleb happily accepts smiling back at her. They look at the Zyklons regaling Camilla and Lyca with stories of their assignments back home. He then notice Mirabelle gaze shifted downwards with a worried expression. He then takes her hand snapping her from her thoughts."Hey, don't worry so much, ok? Whatever other changes happen in our life, we'll face it together; like always.", Caleb whispers into her ear before kissing her cheek.Mirabelle smiles warmly scooting closer until her horsey thighs touch his and leaning against his shoulder before whispering back, "Lali-ho.""Lali-ho.", Caleb chanted their dreamscape mantra back. Drei overheard them and raises a 'what the hell's that about' eyebrow.In the back of Caleb's mind, he couldn't deny the uncertainty he had concerning these powers he was gaining and whether or not he could fully control them. He wondered if he could fullfill the promises he made to Ein about Camilla's anger. Then there were the memories he now had of Camilla...and her mother and how the feelings she had in her memories resonated with him concerning his own mom. At least Camilla doesn't know for certain what happened to her mom. Him? He knew all too well what happened to his. And he was responsible. He was weak."Que?! How did ju even escape?", Camilla stated in an incredulous tone raising up."Oh please, you think we'd go into a stronghold without a contingency? Though it helped that many of the guardsmen were subdued by Drei's paralysis serum.", Ein answers in slightly haughty tone towards the Demoness."It also double as a potent laxative if ingested.", Drei comments making Zwei bursts into laughter followed by Lyca as Ein tries to salvage the...integrity of the story. Mirabelle lightly giggles covering her mouth.Caleb chuckles a bit as well starting to get more engaged with their stories.The next couple of hours Caleb and the girls sat in the living room listening to the Zyklons talk about some of the assignments they had prior to coming to America. At first, Caleb and Mirabelle were a little disturbed by their nonchalance in describing how they killed their target but soon became invested. Maybe it was Zwei and Drei's impetuous storytelling skill or Ein's and Camilla's discretely throwing shade at each other but it made each assassination story more engaging. Some of them involved assassinating radical political and domestic terrorists that threatened host families and ICEP owned businesses and activities as a whole. They dealt with radical liminal protest groups involved with kidnapping human children or attacking/abducting humans for...forced copulation. A few of which were commited by a breed of Lamia called Bunyip, that are actually the natural enemy of the Kamaitachi race. Needless to say, Ein her sisters reeeaallly needed to reign themselves in on those missions to avoid going...overboard in arresting them. Others involved Ein and her sisters taking down leaders of a Triad operating throughout Thailand and Beijing that were involved with liminal trafficking and resource extraction , aka 'hunting' for liminal parts. It was missions like these that exposed them to some gruesome sights. The horns, tails, wings, furs, organs, scales, sometimes entire skins put on display in black markets sold as decoration or "medicinal" properties. Halfway through, Ein and her sisters demeanor became colder when they talked about one instance where they found the blades of their fellow Karmaitachi on display being sold as decorative weaponry or kitchen cutting knives. Zwei even mentions they were scythes belonging to a rival Karmaitachi clan."I...I'm so sorry.", Caleb spoke genuinely to the Zyklons as Mirabelle, Lyca, even Camilla looked shocked to hear that."Don't be. It didn't distract us from our intended target.", Drei replied dispelling any pity they had for them. Caleb and the others give her surprised looks."They WERE still a rival clan of ours, but still, NO Kamaitachi deserves that fate. These are our pride and joy. They're part of our identity. Our soul!", Zwei spoke extending and brandishing her scythes before retracting them back in fur-covered arms, "Worst part is the leader had abducted several of their kits from that same clan preparing them to be sold overseas."" They abducted their children?!", Mirabelle exclaims."Yeah Drei and I had the ringleader back into a corner and the bastard uses one of the kits as a meat shield.", Zwei replies with disgust in her tone."But then along came Ein. She shot her shockwave blast took him down in a flash. It snapped the link to his spinal cord.", Drei chimes as Caleb raises an eyebrow at the way she said that."Yes, thanks Drei, it's what I was aiming for. Anyway we managed to rescue the other children, thank the gods, and they were taken into Beijing's I.A. care services. Several of the workers were detained and that was the end of it.", Ein replied noticing Camilla looking at her introspectivly, "And before anyone asks, no, I didn't feel any satisfaction or anger afterwards. We defeated out target, saved whoever we could, put away the straggler criminals, it's done."Camilla simply looks away in thought. She knows if it were her and she had her way she would've butchered him along with his cohorts involved."Wow, you guys must really have nerves of steel to be able to deal with all that.", Caleb says"Not nerves of steel, more like...a will like the wind.", Zwei replied waggling her finger, "Never know when things can go from a gentle breeze to raging typhoon so it's best to adapt but never lose sight of your goal. That applies to anything really but assissination especially.""Having an international license to kill doesn't hurt either.", Drei points out much to her sisters surprise before both cover her mouth."BUT it doesn't mean we'll in anyway abuse that government sanctioned authority.", Ein informs trying to eliminate any suspicions, "I...hope this doesn't affect our relationship together."Caleb rumenates for a second, "It DEFINITELY makes me see you three in a different light. At the same time though, I kinda trust you guys even more now that I have a better idea who you are. It's weird but...I even feel a lot safer with three badass wind ninjas at my side."Ein and Zwei blush slightly at the compliment as Drei discretely smirks accepting the praise."Heyyyy. Don't forget about me too Cheif! I won't let anyone hurt you! You can count on that!", Lyca complains in annoyance at being overlooked."Hehe, yeah I know, thanks pup.", Caleb sweetly replie petting the top of her quickly calming the She-wolf, "Haven't forgotten my 'Big Rowdy Wolf'."Lyca giggles at her new nickname with a blush her tail happily wagging before she goes straight to nuzzling him. Zwei watches with intrigue and blushing longingly."Me too Dear! I'll always be by your side no matter how utterly daffy things get.", Mirabelle devotedly stated hugging his arm as Caleb thanks her petting the top of her head making her croon sweetly. Ein watches with a slight blush on her cheeks."I as well mi Amor!", Camilla solemnly proclaimed quickly raising from her seat, "No matter who or when our enemy may come, they will not lay a FINGER on mi familia!"The Zyklons turn to her noticing her tone was different than usual; instead of vicious malice it was more like...a genuine desire to protect. Camilla notices them staring at her."I...promise I will not go overboard however.", Camilla clarified.Caleb then raises up and teleports in front of the Demoness, "I know you won't devil darlin'. You're not the kind of person to break your word. Heh that I sho'nough know.", he compliments reaching up petting her head even tracing the tip of her horns making her shudder. Camilla croons lovingly touching his arm."Huh, 'Mi Amor'? That's a bit of step up.", Drei commented in a knowing tone.Caleb turns to her stepping back from Camilla a bit, "Well...yeah...but so is about everything else these past few days."Drei gives him a skeptical look."He's not wrong.", Zwei spoke with a shrug."Yeah... it's been an interesting week. Can't imagine what happen if Sterling found out about any of this.", Caleb dreaded as the others agreed.Suddenly, as if fate been tempted, they hear a knock at the front door catching their attention. Ein gets up answer it."Oh, good day Agent Sterling! ", Ein spoke just loud enough to warn Caleb and the rest without sounding suspicious. They each scramble to different parts of the living room as Caleb flips the tv so that everything appears natural. Sterling enters the house coming into the living room. He notices Caleb, Lyca, Zwei and Mirabelle invested in whatever was on tv while Camilla occupied herself with a random book she snatched up and Drei...had left the room entirely."Afternoon Mr. Bizzell.", Sterling greeted."Oh hey Mr. Sterling! How you been?", Caleb smiled pretending to be surprised to see his agent. Ein joins them with a nervous smile on her face."A bit tired. We've been having an influx of new host families lately along with training newer agents for field work. I haven't had much time to check on my other clients these last several days. I was just passing through here and wanted to see how everyone is adjusting under your care and maybe do a brief cultural assessment for you and the girls.", Sterling explained yawning a bit as he took out his 2-in-1 laptop. He turns back noticing Mirabelle and the others seemingly avoiding eye contact with him, "Is...everything alright with you all?""O-Of course we are! W-why would you assume we weren't?", Mirabelle replied trying to sound surprised."Yeah, we're just in the middle of good show right now.", Zwei affirms."A good show?", Sterling replies in a skeptical tone."Uhh yeah, it's actually one of those new shows on Netflix that came out a little while back called...uhh 'Soul King'. It's getting some great reviews and we just HAD to check it out.", Caleb finesses his back turned to the tv."HAD to check it out", Lyca emphasizes his last statement adding to the hype."It would've been plain criminal NOT to give it a look.", Mirabelle added as Camilla peaks up from the book she was pretending to read."And...your watching it right now?", Sterling inquires raising an eyebrow.Caleb notices Ein shaking her head and decides to answer, "Yep."Ein facepalms herself."Uh huh because you guys do realize your watching Food Network right?", Sterling replied.Caleb and the girls turn to see a lady on tv cooking a platter of flame broiled Southern-style steak as as they went after being caught in a lie. Caleb takes a deep breath before turning to Sterling."Well yeah! It IS a cooking anime. What better way to immerse ourselve by looking at cooking shows then making mental comparisons?", Caleb affirms bullshitting his way out."T-That's right! I hear some of the scenes are bloody over-the-top with...food-gasms?", Mirabelle added as the other girls give her a questioning looks."So yeah! Food-gasms in the show are crazy and we just wanted something to compare it to.", Caleb jumps in helping them face.Sterling raises an eyebrow but decides not to press any further, "Oookay. Alright, so let me just finish setting up so you and the girls can begin the assessment.", Sterling turns back to his 2-in-1 getting it sought up as Caleb sighs in relief."Oh cool, is that the new 2-in-1 from AT&T?!", Caleb changes the subject but also genuinely interested in the device."Yep! Got it last week actually.", Sterling replied. The two men chat about the device as the girls breath a sigh of relief."FOOD-gasms?", Zwei whispers questioningly to Mirabelle trying to hold in a chuckle."I-I'm sorry, I panicked!", Mirabelle quietly whispered back blushing in embarassment....Sterling conducted his cultural assessment for the Bizzell household. It was relatively simple. He would ask Caleb questions on what he had learned about each of his homestays. Sterling was surprised at how much information Caleb could provide on Camilla's species, some of which even ICEP wasn't aware of. He assessed their individual cultures and social practices but also inquired on their preparedness for social interactions outside of the household without chaperone to which they both knew the answer to. He questioned Caleb on certain interests and skills the girls possess in case they even want to join ICEP sponsored workplaces and internships. He then spent some time questioning the girls to assure Caleb was fulfilling his responsibility as host in educating them on basic American culture. He quizzed them on basic Alabama laws, how to use certain municipal services, even had them sing the first half of the American national anthem. Mirabelle did well but Lyca seemed to confuse the national anthem with Sweet Home Alabama by Lenard Skynrrd. Camilla do ok as well but needed to work on the use of certain municipal services. Lastly, he assessed their happiness and whether they felt safe under Caleb's care. Needless to say, it was a RESOUNDING 'yes'. When they were finished, Sterling packed up having everything he needed."Well, Mr. Brazell, I thank you for your cooperation and your continued service the program.", Sterling spoke packing his stuff."It's BIH-zzell, and you're welcome.", Caleb spoke with an annoyed growl to Sterling's amusement."Ms. Ein, Zwei, Drei, keep up the good work.", Sterling praises."Of course, sir.", "Can do.", "There's no other kind", they each answered respectively.As Sterling was walking towards the door, he suddenly stops halfway and turns to them, "Ah, one last thing, I want to know what kind of progress you've all had? Have the 'field trips' been helpful in this little 'project' of ours?"Caleb pauses at the question before looking between each of the girls before simply answering, "Well...yeah, I would say so. I...we definitely feel a little closer to each other."Mirabelle and the rest voice their agreement and were backed up by the Zyklons."Excellent! Glad to hear things are coming along! I WAS a bit worried considering...everything that happened.", Sterling spoke trailing off for a second before clearing his throat, "Ahem, anyway glad to see you're all making progress. Is there anything else you think I should be aware of?""Nope! That's about it!", Caleb assures the government agent."Are you sure?", Sterling inquires in a suspicious voice catching the attention of Caleb and the girls."No? Not a all", Caleb answers."Alright, you guys take care then.", Sterling spoke unassumingly turning around while discretely moving his 2-in-1 to his palm, "YEET!"Sterling suddenly throws the 2-in-1 from behind much to Caleb's horror."Shit! *zoom*" , Caleb elicited before teleporting and catching the tablet in hand, "What the hell Sterling?! Why would...you..."Caleb trails off noticing Mirabelle and the other's horrified expressions then realizing he instinctively teleported himself from behind the kitchen counter to where the tablet would've landed. He then notices Sterling giving him a smug grin."Well...thank god that worked."Caleb rights himself realizing he'd been caught, "Ok, listen this is...totally explainable. Sorta. But look-"" , I know.", Sterling says much to his and the other's surprise, "Yesterday, I heard from a few I.A. worker at that aquarium for the aquatic liminal cultural exposeè about an incident involving a group of Devils and some rowdy human men. But what stood out to me was one black man, they're words not mine, who was with the Devils using some kind of "teleportation" and "energy projection" magic. Now, their description of this man were...vague but knowing your track record for this stuff I guessed it must've been you."Caleb and the others look between each other slightly unsure what to think."Yeesh, am I really that predictable?", Caleb questions sarcastically rubbing the back of his head. As Mirabelle begins to panic worried about what's going to happen to then now."So I'll ask again, is there anything else you think i should be aware of? Mainly, everything you know about these powers", Sterling inquired.Caleb and the others exchange looks realizing they don't have much choice."Ok, it's like this."Caleb and the others spend the next ten minutes telling Sterling every they knew about his new Nightmare abilities, including when he entered Camilla's dreams(while not giving TOO much detail of course)"I see.", Sterling spoke leaning against the nearby wall, "Well, I'd say this is quite the extraordinary occurrence.""That's an interesting way of putting it.", Caleb put plainly."Please Sterling, you have to keep this secret! I don't know how or why this happening!", Mirabelle pleaded, "I...I just don't want to make Caleb's life any harder!"Camilla and Lyca give her surprised looks as Caleb approaches her to the side and petting the top of her head."Moon pie, no! You're not! I don't blame you for any of this and I believe you if you say you don't know. We'll just have to figure it out as we go.", Caleb assures lifting up her chin to make eye contact."Señor is right, Señora! There is no point in remaining afraid of the unknown. The best we can do is help him understand these powers.", Camilla informed not wanting Mirabelle to keep punishing herself. Mirabelle gives them both uncertain looks."Glad you brought that up Ms. Sartana.", Sterling says strutting over to them, "It's definitely important to understand cases just like Mr. Bizzell here."Caleb and the girls turn to him with a puzzled look."What do mean 'cases like me'?", Caleb inquires with slight suspicion."Let's just say you are not the only human to experience...extraodinary changes. We don't quite understand the phenomenon but certain hosts have exhibited some above average, and in rare case, superhuman abilities after living with their students. Whether it be enhanced physical strength and speed even senses such as smell and hearing when hosting Canine or Feline liminal breeds or hosts with aquatic liminals like mermaids now able to hold their breath for over an hour underwater. I even heard of a case in Alaska where a man gained limited cryokinetic abilities upon hosting an Ice Queen for almost a year. ICEP researcher speculate that continued exposer to liminal breeds with...certain needs subconsciously forces the human body to adapt to theses needs. They're thinking of calling it...Metagenesis."Caleb and the girls look between each other questioningly."Uhhh...no offense Sterling but that name sounds retarded.", Caleb says incredulously as Camilla, Lyca, the Zyklons, even Mirabelle nodded in agreement."Hey, I didn't come up with it. Plus, it's still not official what they'll call it.", Sterling defended."It doooes kinda explain how our dad managed to keep up with our moms for so long.", Zwei rumenated."It also helped that they went easy on him...usually.", Drei added."Aaanyway, what I'm saying is in this constantly changing world with powerful beings like yourselves becoming part of society, humans have to change as well.", Sterling says steering the conversation back to it's destination."So...i'm not the only one with powers like this? This seems like the kind of thing ICEP wouldn't want the general public to know about.", Caleb contested."Right you are! As of right now, we've contained this information from leaking out since knowledge of this phenomenon would hurt rather than help liminal human relations. In the same way individuals would exploit Liminal resources and ability the same applies to this case.", Sterling rebutted glancing to Caleb's homestays before turning back Caleb."You, Mr. Bizzell, are simply another unusual case of the effects of humans cohabiting with liminals. Though yours is an especially unusual case given the...rarity of the species you've adapted the abilities of. Sooo...""Ohhhhh hell, I THAT tone again. I think I know where this is going." , Caleb dreads already sensing what the agents intentions are."I was hoping you would. I want you to help with documenting your personal experience wit h having Nightmare abilities. We need more understanding of cases like you for research. It's no more work than what you currently do with collecting Nightmare information. Consider it a side project along with our little private project with your girls", Sterling urges furrowing his eyebrows."You don't miss an opportunity do ya?", Caleb spoke giving him the sideeye."Nope. Besides it's kinda your fault for apparently being the perfect test subject. It seems every visit you manage to surprise me with new, incredibly beneficial information.", Sterling replies, "Also, don't worry, I'm going to keep your changes between us...for now. What I suggest is you get those powers under control to avoid any more...incidents. Sneak some practice in whenever you can."Caleb and Mirabelle look to each other thoughtfully."Sigh, seriously you HAVE to remember, there's only so much I can do to help whenever you make a 'mistake'. If you don't want to draw too much attention, I strongly suggests getting a handle on those powers. Ms. Marequine, I expect you to show him all you know.", Sterling urges Mirabelle who simply nods in understanding. Suddenly, his phone buzzes. He picks it up seeing who it was, "Oh! Time to head back to the office."Sterling hurrries over to front door with Caleb following to see him out. When he was halfway out the door, he turns to Caleb."Don't forget now Mr. Bahzell.", Sterling warns in a more serious tone."I won't. I just wish you'd stop forgetting my damn name.", Caleb replies in a sout tone."Not likely. Okay, thanks again for cooperation and continued service. Oh, and thanks for catching this. It was CRAZY expensive.", Sterling waggles his 2-in-1 in hand before getting in his car and pulling out of the driveway.Caleb goes back inside and is greeted by Mirabelle standing with determined look on her face."Uh Moon pie?""Dear! I believe we should do as Sterling suggests and test your capabilities.", Mirabelle stated."O...kay? But can we wait a little later? I wanted to finish running some specifications on these parts I designed and send them to-""NO! We're doing it right now!", Mirabelle asserted much to his surprise even though her 'Determined face' was really cute."Huhu. ~Well, ju heard the woman Señor.~", Camilla watches leaning over the chair with a smirk."I wanna help Chief train too!", Lyca jumps in."Let's definitely start with that barrier thing you mentioned! I haven't seen what it looks like myself.", Zwei urges."I've got some freshly prepared healing salves so your free to go a little rough on him.", Drei comments present six vials locked between her fingers like Wolverine claws."The hell you mean a 'little rough'? What is your definition of a 'little rough'? ", Caleb questioned glaring nervously at the weasel girl."Just enough for you to protect your paper-thin male pride.", Drei replied snarkily."Okay Dear! Follow my lead.", Mirabelle instructs putting her hands in front of her generating a purple barrier of energy."Hahhh, alright fine but lets do it outside.", Caleb laments his decisions before leading her out to the backyard. His day just got more interesting.WRSup Fam! How's everybody doing since I last updated? I been doing...moderately Ok. Uncle past away the week before Halloween and I find out mom's not doing any better. The fam is still grieving and doing our best in these troublesome times. Now finals are around the corner for me so kinda need to focus on those. Other than that, Goatman is ok and still alive!Hope you liked this chapter. It was tough writing this one so I feel like certain elements could've been stronger. Oh well, next chapter is sure to leave you in tears. I can guarantee that *chuckles menacingly*Welp, that's about it. As always, PEACE FAM!
  
    Chapter Text
    Chapter 37: God Bless the ChildOver two weeks have passed in the city of Huntsville. The month of August was getting close to it's end. Autumn was coming but it was still pretty hot most days; typical weather for the Heart of Dixie.As the seasons change, so have things in the Bizzell household....Flashback...Saturday Afternoon in a secluded area in the park"Hahhh...hahhhh...hooolly shit...", Caleb pants trying to catch his breath. His eyes dart around the trees and bushes anxiously"Awww come on Boss, you can't be that tired already.", came the taunting voice of Zwei on the wind.Caleb grumbles under his breath before raising his arms up defensively The mark on his chest faintly glows as shimmering purple aura appears forming into a dome like barrier on his palms. He then separates his hands creating two separare barriers on either side."Ignore her Dear, concentrate on projecting your mana. Feel it as if it's another limb.", Mirabelle instructs."Right. A purple glowing noncorporeal limb got it. Feels more like I'm trying to hold back a wall of jello-", before Caleb could finish, a jolt shoots up his spine and he quickly intercept a projectile making it lose it's momentum upon impact with the shield and falls to the ground. It was a baseball, a hard one.Two more come soaring in behind him and he quickly intercepts them with his other arm making them fall to the ground as well. He looks down noticing one of the balls from earlier had disappeared. Another jolt shoots up his spine."Oh god! *zoom*", Caleb teleports himself away sensing danger from behind which was Lyca lunging at him trying to tackle him to the ground. She does a mini somersault landing on all fours then shooting a challenging smirk as Caleb. She quickly rushes him with a snarl as Caleb quickly puts up his barrier making it as dense as he could must before the She-wolf delivers a flurry a rapid kicks and claws swipes. She continued this assault pushing Caleb's back against a tree. His sheild weakens to the point the point that her claws could pierce through. Mirabelle watches becoming worried wanting to stop her but then feels a tug on her skirt. Looking down, she sees Drei shaking her head 'no' much to the Centaurs dismay.Lyca digs her claws into the shield glaring and growling at him with fangs bared as the young man tried to maintain his concentration but felt his energy quickly waning and chose to flee.*zoom* Caleb teleports behind the She-wolf, to her surprise, making her lose her balance hitting her against the hard bark."Owww.", Lyca whines holding her forehead."Oh damn, Lyca, you o-GHA!", Caleb says in concerns only to recieve a hard baseball to the cheek leaving a big bruise. Caleb collapses on one knee holding his cheek in pain."Dear!", Mirabelle exclaims about to intervene before Drei stops her. She looks to Caleb her eyes widened in surprise.Caleb clenches his fist in anger as his right arm is engulfed in wispy flame-like purple aura.Three baseballs come soaring towards him at high velocity."AGGH!", Caleb growls swiping his arms sending a wave of compressed flame-like aura that rebelled all three balls away leaving them all partially singed with black marks. Caleb gets to his feet panting his arm still engulfed in purple aura."Zúgòu!(Chinese for 'Enough!'), Drei stated. Upon hearing that, Caleb breathed a sigh of relief that it was over as does Mirabelle.Suddenly, another ball comes soaring and hits Caleb in the stomach."GAHHHhod FUCKING DAMMIT!", Caleb elicits in pain dropping to his knees clutching his stomach."Dear!", "Chief!", Mirabelle and Lyca stated rushing to his"Zwei! Wǒ shuō:"Gòule!"(I said, 'That's enough!), Drei stated again in her native tongue."Oh. Oh! Sorry, I misheard you! Boss, you okay?!", Zwei stated in concern rushing to him."WHAT THE HELL, ZWEI?! Ow.", Caleb threatened raising his arm only to resume gripping his stomach again.Drei uncorks a vial and hands it to Caleb, "drink this."Caleb quickly down it wincing at the strange taste before gulping it down. Seconds latter the pain dulled until it faded away completely."Hahh, thanks Doc.", Caleb expressed gratitude sitting on the ground. Drei raises an eyebrow at the nickname before taking out another vial."I'm more of an apothecary than a doctor. One takes knowledge of medicines the other takes a trust fund and a lab coat.", Drei commented before opening the vial a dark green fluid applying a little on her finger, "Hold still."Caleb winces feeling the sting against his bruised face soon replace by the pleasant sensation of her lubricated fingers against his cheek."That was GREAT Cheif! You really held your ground that time!", Lyca praises giving him a toothy grin."Indeed Dear! You've really improved quite a lot since we began; quicker than I anticipated. You're control is getting better.", Mirabelle praised jubilantly."Hehe, you really think so?", Caleb giggles before noticing Drei giving him a stern look reminding him to sit still.They weren't wrong. Ever since Sterling gave them that advice, the girls, especially Mirabelle, became heavily involved with helping Caleb understand and control his new powers. Everyday, for the last week and a half, when Caleb returned from work they would set aside a couple hours to work on honing Caleb's abilities. Mirabelle provided the bulk of the knowledge on using her abilities while the others assisted in the more...active roles in his training. Camilla helped him with meditation and understanding mana( or internal energy as he preferred to call it), Zwei and Lyca helped improve his control under stressful scenarios (ie attacks from enemies), and Drei handled first aid. It was working. Caleb had gained much more control over his teleportation since he didn't nose bleeds as often. He and Mirabelle even made a discover that, by touching each other and having the same destination in mind, they could both teleport TO that exact location. They discovered this last Friday when they accidentally teleported to Kami House and ended up scary the hell out of a few employees. They played it off as a 'magic act' and proceeded off to the manga section.Mirabelle even taught Caleb her ability to walk without making sound(her 'Silent Clop' as her species called it) which involved suppressing his presence by imagining himself being invisible to everyone. Surprisingly, Caleb didn't have much trouble learning this oneLastly, though it was tough at first, Caleb learned to project energy barriers. They still weren't as dense as Mirabelle's but he soon learned he was able to condense the energy in one locations and enhance his limbs or even fire it as a wave of compressed aura. He tried encorporating it with his judu skills which allowed him to perform powerful throws and deflects projectiles. Only trouble was, he still lacked the stamina to sustain this aura for long."Hell yeah, Boss! You survived a full 15 minutes assault that time!", Zwei stated giving him a thumbs up as Drei finished apply the salve, "At this rate, you'll turn into 'Nightmare Caleb' again in no time."Caleb and the others look to her puzzled, especially Mirabelle."Uhhh what?", Caleb inquires."You know, when you became all glowy with the purple mist at your feet and the enchanced strength; like Ein described and their Ms. Marequine's abilities. It's your Nightmare form. Get it?", Zwei explained."I...guess? Not sure how I feel being called that honestly. Sounds too much like a Marvel hero no one gives a shit about.", Caleb admitted standing to his feet."Like Sleepwalker,", Drei points out.Caleb raises an eyebrow, "Who?""Exactly.""Well, I think it sounds cool.", Lyca beams supportively."Well, to me, he's just my Dear.", Mirabelle say locking her arm to his lovingly resting her head to his shoulder."Really? 'JUST Dear' no 'Sweet handsome smart badass superpowered boyfriend' tacked behind that?' ", Caleb spoke haughtily.Mirabelle rolls her eyes, "You're definitely THREE of those five things and they are my favorites.""Well that's the most backhanded complement as I've ever gotten. Though, coming from you, it's more like a love tap.", Caleb cheekily replies."Oh shove it. If that ego becomes any more chuffed, we might need to enlarge the doors in our home...in the shape of a BEAN!", Mirabelle exclaims before chuckling before Lyca and Zwei join in. Caleb stands unamused but taking their mocking laughter in stride as Drei walks by with a handful of baseballs picking up the rest."Hahaha, don't worry Ms. Marequine. Lycs and I will keep his beanie ego in check.", Zwei chortles high fiving Lyca as Caleb rolls his eyes at them not intimidated, "I mean I can't imagine what your mom went through squeezing out THAT head. She must've needed a butt load of morphine.", Zwei chuckles heartily.Caleb's smile dissolves into a frown as his expression turns dark and he glares at Zwei, "What?"Sensing the venom in his tone Mirabelle and Lyca instinctively step back. Zwei and her sister sense it too with the former becoming nervous upon noticing the menacing purple glow in his eyes."Well I...just meant that-", Zwei tries to defuse things but Caleb cuts her off."You SHUT your GODDAMN mouth about my mom! You understand me?! You don't even know her and never will; So SHUT UP!", Caleb berated the increasingly scared weasel lady as the purple glow in his eyes morphed into intense purple flame-like wisps, "You-""CALEB!", Mirabelle stated snapping Caleb to attention before he turned his enraged glare to her making her flinch in surprise. Her worried expression shifts to one of sadness before uttering, "It's ok..."Caleb expression softens noticing Lyca's worried expression with her ears drooped downward. He then looks to Zwei who looked afraid; not for herself but for him."I-I'm sorry. Really Boss, I didn't mean to...", Zwei apologized sincerely.Caleb is taken aback realizing what he was doing before his eyes return to normal. He goes looking downwards in shame."I know. I'M the one should be sorry. You didn't deserve that. None of you do.", Caleb spoke softly but loud enough for them to hear."Chief?", Lyca inquired slowly approaching him."I'm okay, Lyca. I just...I want to call it a day.", Caleb says trying to assure her."That's fine. You did well today anyway.", Drei says encouragingly.Caleb nods glancing to Mirabelle unable to make eye contact before offering his hand. Mirabelle gingerly and gently squeezes it giving him a worried look. Zwei, Lyca, and Drei each join hands with the couple making a circle."Beams us up Mr. B.", Drei commented.Caleb forces a giggle shaking his head. He and Mirabelle squeeze each others hands and concentrate. A faint purple aura emanates from the pair before spreading over Lyca and the Zyklons as they focused on their common destination.*Zoom* they all teleport together. They reappear in Caleb's backyard. Caleb releases Mirabelle and Zwei's hand before pulling away from the group heading to the sliding doors."Dear...Are you alright?", Mirabelle started in a worried tone already knowing the answer.Caleb stops his hand on the door but not turning around to look at her and not speakinhChief...please don't be mad.", Lyca spoke approaching him gently touching her pawpads to his back."I'm not Lyca. I...I just want to be alone right now, ok?", Caleb spoke gently petting the top of her head the She-wolf immediately noticing how half-hearted and empty it felt than normal. Caleb slides the doors open and steps inside."Humph, why should I listen to a damn minion of Satan like you?", Ein says in a mocking tone doing her best Southern accent while holding up a makeshift mask of a human woman.Camilla grimaces but tries to keep her composure, "Nu do not have to, and that is fine by me...but if ju don't ju will miss the bus. It only runs this route twice a day.""Good, that was very good. You avoided a would be altercation that time with a relevant rebuttle.", Ein praises the Elder Devil who smirks feeling a bit proud of herself. When they weren't assisting the others with Caleb, the two spent the last week helping Camilla control her anger and...impulsives by going through interactive scenarios where she encounters distrusting, fearful, and just plain rude humans. Camilla then turns her attention to Caleb."Ah, welcome back Senor!", Camilla happily greeted."Hey.", Caleb utters as her manuevers past the couch not making eye contact which Camilla notices. Mirabelle and the others enter the house as well. Camilla and Ein notices the plaintive expressions on their faces."How was... training today?", Ein inquires noticing Zwei looking away and Drei simply taking a seat eyes closed in thought, "Did something happen?""No, nothing happened, Ein. Listen, I'm going to be in my office for awhile. Call me if you need me.", Caleb spoke before heading off down the hallway ignoring when Ein tried to inquire further."What is wrong with Senor?", Camilla inquires becoming concerned, "Did something terrible happen during training? Was he hurt?!""No! W-Well...a bit but...Ms. Drei healed his wounds. It's just...", Mirabelle trails."He got triggered by what Zwei said about his mom.", Drei stated picking up where she left off. Zwei tenses up nervously giving her sister who threw her under the bus an inquisitive look."What?! What did you say?!", Ein demanded"Nothing! I...just made a little joke about his head and...his mom giving birth and...", Zwei explains her voice becoming softer and more shameful the more she continues."Ugh! Why am I not surprised? You ALWAYS do this! You take it too far and end up saying something stupid.", Ein stated irritated at her sister. Zwei wanted to retort but found no words to say."It's not entirely her fault, Ms. Ein! It's just...something very personal to Dear. She even apolgized.", Mirabelle defended."Yeah, and Chief forgave her!", Lyca added affirmatively before folded her arm with a worried look, "Still..."Ein looks to them then to Zwei before letting out a sigh, "hahhh, alright.""Señora? What did ju mean by its 'very personal' to Señor?", Camilla inquires looking to Mirabelle soon joined by Lyca and the Zyklons.Mirabelle is quiet for a moment, "Ms. Ein? You and your sisters are aware of Dear's personal history, correct? That includes what happened to his parents."Ein and her sisters exchange glances a moment as Camilla and Lyca focus their attention on them."Yes, we are aware of an accident that took the lives of Mr. Bizzell's parents.", Ein says trying not to sound unsympathetic.Camilla and Lyca eyes widen in shock."Wait, what?!", Lyca exclaims."That's right.", Mirabelle continued, "And you know his uncle, and ONLY him, is listed as his emergency contact?"Yes..correct ", Ein replies starting to piece together what she's trying to say."Don't you find that peculiar? Dear never talks about his family, never mentions anything about his siblings, there aren't even any photos of them in the house.", Mirabelle pointed out these points as the others realize what she was saying were true."Honestly, we only know what we were briefed on. Anything else they would've informed us by now but...", Zwei says ponderously leaning her chin against the couch cushion."Perhaps he simply does not have much contact with his birth familia?" Camilla guessed, "Although, perhaps there is more to that story than we know.""Dear never likes to talk about it. He always gets depressed whenever he does so...unless it's his uncle I try not to bring it up.", Mirabelle spoke somberly."Señora? If ju enter Señor dreams at night, surely ju must have seen his memories as well.", Camilla inquires going on her experience with Caleb the week before.Mirabelle expression turns serious, "No. No! I would NEVER do that him! Whatever he wishes to keep private, I will NOT violate that privacy for my own curiosity! It...it just wouldn't be right. I want him to tell me on his own but...", she trails look downwards despondently.Camilla gets to comfort the Centaur, "Los sientos, Señora. I understand."Mirabelle accepts the hug still feeling worried for Caleb. As did Lyca and the Zyklons.While this was going on, Caleb sat in his office trying to take his mind off things by immersing himself on the newest prototype model for work. As he sat at his computer waiting for SolidWorks to reopen, he repeatedly glances at a small compartment droor at his desk. After an internal debate, he opens it, pulling out a large brown leather bound book with the words 'The Bizzell Family' Arial. He opens it flipping through some pages and photos becoming more frustrated with each page before quickly closing it. He covers his teary eyes choking back his sobs before slamming his fist hard against the desk.He looks up through teary eyes seeing todays date on the computer and dread crept through his body. The anniversary of that day was coming up soon. With everything else going on, he hadn't really noticed. Even the pain in the ass training the past week served as a welcome distraction. It wouldn't be as bad if he were alone this year but now...Moon pie, Lyca, Camilla, the Zyklons,...how long could he hide from them? How long before they find out about him? Would they end up hating him too?'Why did turn out like this?', Caleb thought remorsefully clutching the book.Flashback end...4 days later...DreamscapeCaleb finds himself standing in a cemetery in a daze. He turns his head to see a group of people in funeral attire standing around two large graves all their heads bowed in prayer. A sinking feeling of fear fills his being. He notices the preacher laying the bodies to rest every word of the prayer sounding like fast-paced gibberish. Caleb stares in horror at the two graves."I-", Caleb uttered only to be cut off by the preacher."MURDERER!", He loudly screams pointing his finger at Caleb before being joined the rest of the funeral attendees. Caleb's eyes widen in shock seeing they eack had no face and each pointing the finger at him accusingly."N-no...it was-", Caleb pleaded only to be cut off again. This time...by his older brother."IT WAS YOUR FAULT! YOU DID THIS!", his brother screamed angrily in his face."YOU RUINED OUR FAMILY YOU SELFISH FUCKTARD!", Came the hateful voice of his older sister. She then grabs him by the collar digger her nails into his skin, "It should've been YOU. Worthless piece of shit!", she stated in his ears before shoving him backwards hard."Agh! No...no...I didn't mean...", Caleb yelps in pain. The last thing he sees are his siblings and rest of his family glaring at him scornfully before moving further and further away. His eyes widen seeing his parents stand by their own graving wordlessly staring at him in disappointment. Tears trickle down his cheaks as they fade away leaving him in darkness. He gets to his hands and knees sobbing at the ground, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.""Oh believe me, you will be.", came a sinister but familiar voice that sent a chill down Caleb's spine. Before he could react, a golden chain wraps around his neck hoisting him to his feet as he gags flails and coming face-to-face with the evil Angel Azaeli grinning wickedly at him, "Like I said, you just bring misery to everyone. You did it to your family...and you'll do it to them."Caleb looks to where she pointed to the horrific sight before him. There stood Chrolla the Hellhound standind over Lyca's freshly killed body, Camilla on her knees collared and chained as Wick firmly presses the heal of his boot to her head, and Nikolai holding a glock standing over Mirabelle's bullet hole ridden body. Even the Zyklon sister lies dead in pools of their own blood and arms split open leaving open wounds where their scythes used to be. Words could not describe the torrent of anguish and rage flowing through him as he glared at Azaeli."~Aww, what's wrong baby boy? Gonna cry to mommy? Well...", Azaeli reaches to her side before holding up the now decomposed, foul-smelling decrepit body of Filo, "MAYBE IF YOU WISH HARD ENOUGH YOU'LL BRING HER BACK TOO! HAHAHAHAHA"Caleb's eyes glow bright purple as rippling aura covers his body and dispelling the chain. He tackles Azaeli to the ground strangling her as hard as he could her jeering laughter never ceasing. He delivers a solid punch only for the Angel to morph in Wick still laughing at him. He repeatedly punches as his foe morphs between Azaeli, Nikolai, Chrolla, and Wick as their laughs grow louder despite his continued assault before finally...it morphs into HIMSELF."See? You ARE a murderer. HehehAHAHAHAHA!", his doppelganger laughs hysterically at him."RAAGGGGHHHHH!", Caleb bellows his aura intensifying and delivery a barrage of misdirected punches."DEAR! *Slice*", Screamed the voice of Mirabelle stopping Caleb's assault as glowing horizontal cleave in space followed by several more slashes cutting through everything. The entire area dissolves into purple smoke including Azaeli and the other until the entire area had been transformed into the dreamscape. Caleb looks around before noticing Mirabelle clutching her Dreamscythe with a saddened expression on her face. Before drops with a clang before kneeling beside him hugging him tight as she could beginning to sob. Before he could say a word, she forcefully pulls him close snuggling his head in her bosom, "IT'S OK...sniffle...it's ok. It's ok, my Dear."Real worldCaleb eyes shot open darting around as he takes a moment to piece together where he was. His chest heaves and the front of his t-shirt was drenched in sweat.*sob*A soft whimper caught his attention before finally noticing Mirabelle in her usual spot with pained expression on her face. He looks to her but doesn't say anything for a moment. She opens her mouth to speak but has no words."You don't need to say it, Moon pie.", Caleb spoke flinging the cover off his legs bringing them over the edge so he could sit up elbows to his knees and head hanging low, "It's just a bad dream so let's try and forget about it.""You know I can't do that!", Mirabelle stated stepping in front of Caleb and cupping his hands together, "They are MORE than just mere dreams. This is the fourth time in a row you've dreamy of killing those people! That isn't normal Dear!""Yeah, I guess I'm just not normal huh? I'm just a FREAK like everyone says right?!", Caleb stated stepping away from her then aggressively flinging open his closet and grabbing a shirt and pants. Mirabelle watches him change with deeply saddened eyes."Who says that Dear?", Mirabelle questions remembering those people from the dream, "Dear? You've been so distant lately and your dreams are only getting worse! Please my love, tell me what's wrong!"Caleb looks back at her seeing her tearful but devoted purple eyes feeling a wave of guilt. He felt horrible for doing this to her. She didn't deserve to go through this shit with him. However, he knew he wouldn't be able to hide who he was from her much longer. He had to admit those powers of hers are both blessing and a curse on him. Well, if he was going to be exposed sooner or later, he may as well do so on his own terms. What would she think of him afterwards? He didn't know."I'm sorry Moon pie. I'm sorry for putting you through this.", Caleb spoke lowly not making eye contact.Mirabelle closes the distance laying her hands to his bare chest taking note that his muscled had become more firm from the training, " 'We'll deal with it together'. Isn't that what you always tell me?"Caleb pauses a moment, "Yeah...you got me there."Suddenly, he got an idea how he would tell her."Hey, Moon pie?""Yes Dear?", Mirabelle inquires listening closely."We...haven't really gone on many dates lately have we? You know...just the two of us?"Mirabelle thought for moment realizing he was right then nodding in agreement."I was thinking, well AFTER I meet with Rodney today, we could go back to the botanical gardens again. There's this special area I couldn't show you last time because it was too early in the season. Summer coming to an end so...now's the perfect time.", Caleb explains."That sounds wonderful Dear.", Mirabelle says with a small grin, "But...we still need to talk about what has been troubling you!""We will as soon as we get there. I promise.", Caleb assures but feeling a sense of dread in the back of his mind. Mirabelle nods happily before leaning in to kiss him only for him to turn away. She looks at him both surprised and hurt, "I'm sorry just...not in the mood right now? I'm gonna go take a shower. You guys can start breakfast without me.""Ok...Dear.", Mirabelle replies forcing a smile. Caleb goes to the door heading for the bathroom and leaving the Centaur alone in his room. Mirabelle hugs her sides securely remembering the images from Caleb's dreams before picking up his pillow. She hugs it close to her chest taking in the remnants of his warmth and his scent. She feels her hand drifting down feeling an ache in her lower lips. She and Caleb haven't been as...intimate for the last week and it was getting to her. Even in the dreamscape, he wasn't receptive to her which actually hurt even more. Honestly, it's to the point where a simple titfuck or conalingus wouldn't be enough. She wanted more. So much that she considered using ...that on him.She shakes her head driving the idea from her mind. She knew it was selfish of her to even consider it ESPECIALLY with what he's going through. Mirabelle sighs before teleporting back to her room to relieve her stress...for now.After a nice shower, Caleb steps out of the bathroom fully dressed and a bit more refreshed. He could her the sounds of life from the living room and kitcen but was reluctant to join everyone even though he knew he couldn't avoid them forever. As he approaches the living room, he notices Mirabelle, Lyca, and the Zyklons having a little pow-wow near the kitchen counter while Camilla continues cooking with Ein assistance both still listening and providing input.Caleb sighs reluctantly stepping out from the hallway. Lyca was the first to notice his presence."Hey! Morning Chief!", The She-wolf greeted bounding ovw×er to him with a loving smile. She then plants a quick kiss on his lips surprising him and the others. She blushes with a chuckle, "Hehe, just a little pick me up to get the day started. Did it work?"Caleb pauses a second realizing what she's trying to do. He gives her a small grin followed by a headpat, "Yeah...thanks Lyca."Lyca notices his touch still felt a little empty but continued to smile for his sake. She then goes to finish her food hoping it was still where she left it. Zwei repeatedly glances at Caleb still feeling a little bad about what happened a few days ago."~Breakfast is ready mi Amor~!", Camilla chimes in presenting a delicious smelling potato, bacon, and egg skillet in one hand before placing it on the counter, "I hope ju like it a bit spicy.""Eh, mild is my limit. I'm kind of a lightweight.", Caleb replies sitting at the counter with Zwei and Drei who sat eating some chicken and Lo Mein noodles Ein made. He takes a bite pretending not to notice Camilla watching him. Immediately he's greeted with an explosion of meaty flavor and spices, "Whoa, this is incredible Camilla. It's so...perfectly balanced.""As all things should be.", Drei commented before slurping up her noodles."I'm happy to here that. ~There is more where that came from so enjoy mi Amor~", Camilla spoke seductively winking at him before placing a can of DD Pepper in front of him. He thanks her forcing a small grin.Caleb notices the Elder Devil gives a look to Mirabelle who nods approvingly. She turns around passing by Ein discretely muttering something to her. When Caleb had finished half his food, Ein approached him."So Mr. Bizzell, Ms. Marequine informs us that you both will be going to a botanical garden for a 'field trip' later, correct?", Ein inquires"Uhhh, yeah, that's right.", he answers looking to Mirabelle who quickly looks away resume eating her frosted miniwheats and chopped honeydew melon."Have you decided which of us will accompany you?", Ein asks as her sisters shift their attention to Caleb."No...didn't really give it any thought. Sorry about that.", Caleb apologized feeling he was being inconsiderate toward them."W-well, no problem! I would be more than obliged to watch over you bo-!", Ein proposed"ACTUALLY...i'll do it. The two of you would be needed more here.", Drei jumps in dabbing her lips with a napkin pushing her clean plate away before looking to Caleb, "Is that ok with you?:"Yeah, that's fine.", Caleb answers back still eating not bothering to look at her. Drei gives him a pensive look before nodding to her sisters.Ein and Zwei give her a questioning look but decide to trust her judgement. Suddenly, the tv in the living room flips on with Lyca sitting at the couch with the remote. A news special called 'Good Morning Alabama' appears on tv with a newscast sitting around a table.'And protests continue throughout East Mississippi and West Alabama following the U.S. government and the Interspecies Exchange Programs approval of interspecies marriage. Reports of Liminal businesses and services being vandalized have but MON forces under constant patrol and have host families taking precautions to ensure their students safety. Consequently, multiple waves of counter-protests from the 'LLSI'(Love is Love, Species is Irrelevant) movement with humans and liminals voicing their approval and further ratification barring romantic relationships in general through acts of civil disobedience and social media stories of individuals sharing their story involving their non-human partners.', spoke an newswoman as Lyca and the others listen on. The segments ends and a newsman picks up with another.'On a related note, victims of the highly addictive drug Gluttony Fang experience extreme withdrawal symptoms have been involved in a number of armed robberies throughout Central Alabama.

With supplies of the drug hindered my ICEP and police, those addicted are being forced to undergo rigorous treatment with no sign of progress. Several victims have already reported to have committed suicide while others have succomb to a death by poisoning ironically from not recieving doses of the substance. It's-'Before it could finish, Lyca changes the channel.Mirabelle looks to see Caleb looking down despondently messing with the leftover food on his plate before closing his eyes inhaling slowly."Dear-", Mirabelle spoke before...*ding dong*The sound of the doorbell ringing got their attention."I'll get it!", Zwei stated going to answer the door, "Hey Boss! It's the skinny weirdo again!"Ein gives opens her mouth to say something but the sound of Caleb's chair sliding against the floor as he rises from his seat catches her."Alright!", Caleb answers as Rodney his supervisor enters the house carrying his laptop bag and two large white binders."Mornin' to you too Ms. Zwei.", Rodney says as the weasel rolls her eyes before shutting the door, "Hey Cal.""Hey Rodney. You got everything?", Caleb inquires."Everything under the sun and whatever the folks in development will let us have.", Rodney jokingly says before looking around at Mirabelle and the others, "Mornin' everybody.""Good morning, Mr. Lidell.", Mirabelle replies."Hi!", Lyca stated waving to him."Y'all got it smelling good in here! Like sweet and spicy home cookin' straight from heart. ", Rodney commented."That would be Ms. Camilla's cooking then. She puts PLENTY of heart in every meal.", Ein says gesturing to Camilla who shoots her a glare not wanting the attention from the man who turns to her surprised."O-oh...is that right?", Rodney utters avoiding eye contact with the Demoness. Camilla notices Ein gesturing to her to engage.Camilla restrains herself and put on a smile, "Jes...that is right. If ju would like, I would be...happy to make you a plate. There's plenty left.", she says feeling a little sick inside but maintaining her composure.Rodney gives her a surprised look, "Oh! That's...nice of you but I already had ate. Thanks anyway though."Camilla nods eye twitching as Ein discretely gives her a thumbs up."Uhh Rodney? You ready?", Caleb inquires."Yeah! Yeah, let's go man.", Rodney said heading to Caleb's office.Caleb turns to Mirabelle, "We'll be done in a little bit Moon pie."Mirabelle nods to him understandingly as Caleb looks to Camilla."You did great.", he praises her.Camilla smiles, "G-Gracias, Señor."He heads off to his office but then does a u-turn to scoop up the can of DD Pepper and resuming to the office. Mirabelle and Camilla shakes their head at the predictability then the former decides to prepare for her date.2 hours pass and Caleb was able to get everything he needed from Rodney and along with providing an ample amount of research and calculations for their latest project. After providing Caleb with the research materials and fuel line specifications, he packed up his stuff and went back to the office for the day. Around this time, Mirabelle enjoyed a bath and some much needed girl talk with Camilla, Lyca, and even Zwei before getting changed.Caleb waited in the living room sitting on the couch with Drei and Ein with something playing on tv that he barely payed attention to. He had too much on his mind right now and needed to focus. He then notices Drei staring inquisitively at him. Or, more specifically, his arms."What?", Caleb finally inquires."Hm? Oh nothing. I was just imagining what you'd look like with leather gloves. ...Probably like a tool honestly.", she lied as Ein gives her a look.Caleb raises an eyebrow, "O...kay? Leather gives me a rash anyway so..."An awkward silence quickly befalls them but thankfully Mirabelle appeared from the hallway."I'm ready now Dear!"Caleb turns quickly raising up to see his girlfriend dressed in a black frilled cloak with silver buckle at her waist. She wore a lavendar loose fitting long sleeve button down jacket and purple t-shirt with white crescent moon design and oval opening for ample cleavage. She wore her Sailor moon pins in her hair. Caleb blushes at the sight of her."You look great, Moon pie.", Caleb complimented."Y-you look handsome as well Dear.", Mirabelle says blushing as the two begin to drift into their own world."You guys ready to go or do you wanna keep earning that 'Vanilla' tag?", Drei commented wanting to get things started already. Mirabelle and Caleb snap back to reality looking away embarassed, "Achievement unlocked.", Drei stated."Alright yeah let's go.", Caleb says maneuvers around the couch as Mirabelle follows him to the door. At that moment, Camilla, Lyca, and Zwei emerge from the hallway having enjoyed a pleasant bath with the latter drying her head with a white towel."~Haaaa we need one of these in our house.~", Zwei blissfully moans before looking to Caleb."Have fun you guys! Bring me something yummy back.", Lyca stated happily seeing them off."Yeah, thanks hun, and sure.", Caleb replied, "Try not to break anything while we're gone.""We'll look after things here sir. No need to worry.", Ein assures confidently.Caleb nods to her before looking to Mirabelle who smiles at him."Alright, bye guys.""Bye Señor, we love ju!", Camilla stated adoringly as"Love you Chief!", Lyca chimes in as Ein and Zwei look away awkwardly. Drei raises an eyebrow then gives Caleb an expectant look.Caleb pauses a moment in surprise before answering, "Love you guys... too."The pair and Drei exit the door with the audible sound of it closing as Camilla and Lyca give worried looks.Ein and Zwei regain themselves sharing a look.Outside, Caleb and Mirabelle boarded the trolley and headed off to their destination with Drei following them the whole way. They ride there was a bit awkward and quiet. Caleb still contemplated whether or not it was a good idea to tell her. He didn't want to ruin what he had built. He had already lost his actual family, if he loses her too...They eventually arrive and dismount the trolley. They go to the register themselves in at the front entrance before stepping into the gardens. They look around noticing there weren't too many people out today save for a few staff and visitors."It looks like we just about have the place to ourselves this time around.", Mirabelle comments casually interlocking her fingers."heh, yeah...looks like it.", Caleb replies noticing her uncertain demeanor. He could tell debating whether or not to give him his space.'Go on, take her hand dammit. Don't be a pussy, she's your girlfriend. You've done WAY more than that so why are you shy now?', Caleb cursed himself internally before reaching out offering his hand, "Ahem, milady?"Mirabelle giggles at his mock chivalry deciding to play along and takes his hand, "Milord."The couple made their way further into the gardens passing a couple families and a few other liminal-human couples on the way, even being greeted by security with a welcoming tip of the hat. At one point, they came across this trio of human teenage girls who wanted a few selfies with Mirabelle while Caleb took the pictures. It was a pleasant, sunny day out today with the occasional cooling gentle breeze but also, it being late Summer, everything was at it's peak germination creating an assortment of delightful scents. They stopped by some familiar sights but also enjoyed some brand new ones like an exhibit inhabited by several Dryads and a few Alraune. Mirabelle had a nice time here even if the Alraune would NOT stop flirting with Caleb. After this, they came across a food stand and decided to buy some snacks for later; Southern fried cinnamon red apples, ranch tuna salad bites, mini- veggie wraps, and a few cans of Arizona tea (green for Caleb and blueberry for Mirabelle).With bags in hand, Caleb soon brought her to the area he talked about earlier. It was a large pond with three red arcing bridges connected to the main lands surrounded by lush greenery and vibrant colora of pink, white, and yellow flowers. It was also connected to a forest of bamboo. There were several elements of Japanese culture such as a large Shinto shrine, stepping stones, and Buddhist decorations."Well, here we are.", he says.Mirabelle gives a confused look, "Umm, Dear, it's beautiful but we were he last time. Weren't we?""Yes, but there's something I didn't get to show you last time. Come on, follow me.", Caleb motions for her to follow. They walk along the stone trail come to the bamboo forest. Caleb gets off the trail to stepping over the chain guards indicating the area was restricted to the public. Caleb steps inside the bamboo before realizing Mirabelle wouldn't be able get in as easy. Plus, he had the bags with their food. He then goes up to her."You trust me right?", Caleb asks gently taking her hand."Of course Dear.", Mirabelle replies looking him in the eye."Ok.", Caleb says before looking around making sure no one was watching, "Follow my lead."He closes his eyes and concentrates while she does the same. He focuses on his destination and...ZoomThey teleport away. Drei suddenly appears looking a slightly annoyed."Haahh, THIS is why I hate escort missions.", She says before leaping upwards with a gust of wind to find them.The couple reappear. Mirabelle could hear water flowing and opens her eyes surprised by what she saw. They stood at the edge of a miniature waterfall in a lower level clearing in the bamboo forest with grassy sections in each side. Surrounding the base of the bamboo were assortment of different color flowers with strange erect petals. The whole area had an earthy-sweet aroma and the water vapor and sunlight created a rainbow against the waterfall.Mirabelle looks to Caleb with surprise"Nice right? Not many people know about this place, not even most of the staff here. I found out about this place a couple years back from a coworker. This wholllle area is just below the pond up there so the only way in to climb down through that opening. Luckily, we had our own key to this uhh...Asian Eden or whatever.", Caleb explains in a nonchalant tone as Mirabelle looks around in amazement."Dear...it's so beautiful.", Mirabelle stated kneeling down running her hand in the cool water then caressing one of the flowers, "It's so peaceful and the plants are so healthy.""Those are called 'bromeliads' or Broms for short. I read they supposed to be a symbol of success in love and wealth especially at this time of year where they bloom at their best. I don't know about that but they are pretty.", Caleb replies putting the bags down then sitting on the ground next to his girlfriend. He opens the bags pulling out a black food tray hand it to her, "Not a bad place for lunch right?""Hehe, I wouldn't sell it THAT short but I agree.", She replies opening the tray happy to see it was the mini veggie wraps then pops one into her mouth humming blissfully at the deliciously fresh vegetables and tangy sauce.Caleb hands her a can of blueberry tea which she accepts before taking out his can of green tea and his tray of tuna wraps."Damn, this is pretty good.", Caleb commented popping another one in his mouth."Oh. May I try one Dear? I'll happily share mine too.", Mirabelle ask presenting one of her veggie rolls."I thought you couldn't eat meat?", Caleb questions."Mainly, no, since I naturally can't digest it. However, fish and certain seafoods are fine once in awhile.", She explains."Alright then.", Caleb says presenting his tray for her to take one. She gives a displeased look pushing it away to his confusion before presenting her open mouth to him. He guessed whar she wanted, "Really? We're doing that cliche?"Mirabelle puffs her cheeks out looking annoyed, "Don't be a prude Dear. Now, say, 'ahhhhh' I'll do it to ahhhh"Caleb rolls his eyes opening his mouth while presenting the tuna roll for her. They cross each other popping their respective snacks in each other mouths."Mmm this is pretty good Dear.", Mirabelle mumurs her mouth still a little full."Yeah, this ain't bad either. Am surprised you didnt go ITADAKIMASU afterwards.", Caleb stated in a mock Japanese."Oh shut it!", Mirabelle playfully bumps his shoulder inciting a light chuckle from him.The pair continued to feed each other. The fried cinnamon apples were especially delicious. Soon they finished their small lunch packing up the containers and empty cans and tying them up to put in a proper trash can later.At this time, Drei then appears looking down from the bamboo having finally found them. She slides down to the ground hiding among the stalks quietly observing them.They sat together enjoying the scenery before Mirabelle feels that ache again. She temptingly along his thigh as he turns to her seeing the want in her eyes. She shifts her body to face him better before leaning closer mushing her breast to his arm inticingly then going for a kiss. Caleb turns away before scooting from her much to her surprise and deep concern."I-I'm sorry Moon pie, I just-""Just what?! Just bored of me now?!", Mirabelle stated feeling hurt before catching herself, "I-I didn't mean that! I...I just want you to tell me what's wrong. Those dreams you've been having. Your parents, your siblings, and now you're dreaming of KILLING people?!"Caleb looks away turning his gaze at the ripling water before feeling her gentle hand against his cheek turning his head to meet her purple orbs."Come back to me. What do those dreams mean?", she spoke softly.Caleb opens his mouth to speak only for to come out as choked stutters before he clears his throat, "Moon pie there's...alot I need to tell you that I should've told you before we started dating. I love you and I didn't want our relationship to be built on lies but...I was so afraid that...if you knew who I am...you wouldn't want to stay with me. Like everyone else I told this to."Drei listens on before taking out her phone hitting the video recording."Dear, it's ok. Nothing would ever make me stop loving you. So please, tell me.", Mirabelle assuresCaleb stands with a deep sigh composing himself as he faced the waterfall. He takes a deep breath, "It all started when I was growing up as a kid growing up in a Boligee; small rural town in the Southwest. My family life was nice in the beginning. I got along ok with my siblings and our parents took great care of us.", Caleb's tone then shifts, "It wasn't until I was about 7 or 8 when our dad accepted this new job in Tuscaloosa and mom finished her doctorate in psychology and we had to move. The transition was tough as is but work kept mom and dad away alot and the relationship with my brother and sister gradually soured.""Why was that?", Mirabelle inquired."Who knows. Could be they made friends with kids their age or just saw me as their annoying baby brother who couldn't do anything right. Truth be told, we kinda always had our issues even back in thr old house, they just worsened when we moved.", Caleb explains in a humdrum tone, "School was even worse for me. Even back in Boligee kindergarten, I was never a social child. I was even tested for autism but it came up negative. I was just antisocial. Regardless, I was often bullied because of it. When we moved, it got even worse. Everyday throughout elementary to high school, I was bullied, harassed, and had rumors spread about me by my peers. The teachers didn't help much and half didn't seem to care at all. It didn't help that my male peers always were more confident and stronger than me when it came to sports, popularity, and girls. They were the worst of my bullies. I was just...inferior by comparison. I just didn't fit in anywhere."Mirabelle and Drei listen on as he explains himself. The former perfectly understanding where he was coming from."Well...I don't think you are.", Mirabelle says assuringly."Heh, wish I could've heard that back then. Maybe I wouldn't have done all that stupid shit."Mirabelle tilts her head, "What do you mean?""Like I said, I had a massive inferiority complex and I wanted give some sense of control and strength. Be the man my peers found it easy to be. I started shoplifting even vandalized school property a few times. I knew it was wrong but the rush I felt after doing it and getting away was addicting. I felt in control. Strong.", Caleb admitted before sighing heavily, "Then I got caught stealing at the mall and was arrested."That part catches Mirabelle and Drei off guard."Y-You were arrested?!", Mirabelle exclaims"Well, technically, the police were called...and so were my parents. No report was ever filed since I was a minor and didnt take anything too expensive. They were so angry at me, their fifteen-year-old criminal. Soon word spread around our neighborhood. Folks started dragging my parents name in the mud because of me. They never outright said they were disappointed but neither one looked at me the same way again which hurt even worse. My brother and sister seemed to distance themselves from me entirely after that.", Caleb spoke sadly before taking a deep breath, "As you can imagine school life got even worse afterwards and my parents knew it but their work kept them from home more and more. I just honestly wanted out of that place. I was just...tired of everything. Luckily, I got my wish when Uncle Junior offered to take me in for awhile and transfer me to the high school here in Huntsville Vanessa went to. Things got a little better, at least I wasn't bullied anymore or at least not as much; especially with Vanessa watching my back and Junior started teaching me Judo martial arts to raise my self-confidence a bit. Even tried getting me back into church but I never really saw much point in it. I ended up finishing my Junior and Senior year there. But...""But what?", Mirabelle inquires noticing the coldness in his voice, "It's ok, Dear."Caleb gulped feeling a lump in his throat then takes a deep breath, "When it came time to graduate from high school, college was the next step. My parents pressured me to enroll at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa where they went and to return home. But I didn't want to leave since I never FELT at home there. What followed was a series of heated arguments between my parents and me with Uncle Junior caught in the middle. My dad...he took it especially bad saying Junior was my "new dad". And my mom...?", Caleb pause a moment rubbing the sweat from his forehead, "and then came the day before graduation. I had accepted a full ride scholarship to Alabama A&M which they weren't too happy about since it meant I'd be away from them longer. But, despite how strained we were now, I wanted to be at my graduation just like they were for my brother and sister. Of course, another argument broke out and it was our worst one yet. Looking back, it was so stupid, I knew they had work and Huntsvile is a 3 hour drive from Tuscaloosa but...I wanted them to be there so bad. I wanted them to be proud to see me doing ok. When they said they weren't coming...I exploded at them over the phone. I was just so ANGRY they couldn't take a little time out for me. W-We went back and forth until...gulp..""You can do it, Dear.", Mirabelle encourages stroking his hand.Caleb feels choked up as her struggles to get the words out, "I...I told them I hated them...and they could go to hell."Mirabelle and even Drei are taken aback as Caleb chokes back a sob."A...A-After that...I hung up on them. I...told myself I didn't care. I would do it with them there or not.", Caleb tries to control his voice and her breath as her rubs his face repeatedly, "I attended my graduation with Junior and Vanessa there, got my diploma, took some pictures...it wasn't until we got home...we were greeted by a state trooper waiting for us. They...gulp...""T-They what?", Mirabelle reluctantly asks.Caleb takes a deep breath, "They... informed us...there had been an accident on the interstate. An 18 wheeler turned over killing 7 people...gulp...two of the bodies were identified as my mom and dad.", Caleb spoke as tears trailed down his cheek.Mirabelle eyes widen in shock mouth hung agape while Drei listens on also in shock. Mirabelle had no words, nothing."I found out later...they left in the afternoon. They had a cake made...some of these graduation balloons...they were gonna surprise me.", Caleb sadly smiles wiping his tears as his voice cracked, "It was my fault. I selfishly guilted them into coming...and they did. How did I thank them? By telling them to go to hell. Not, "I love you both", Not, 'I'm sorry for everything', Not, 'That's okay, i know you're busy'. I hate you both...and you can go to hell. And those will forever be my last words to them.""Dear...", Mirabelle uttered sadly.Caleb shakes his head, "After that, my siblings found out as did the others in our family. They found out about our argument before their deaths and they blamed me for it; they were right. My brother found me and beat the shit out of me before Junior pulled him off. I...didn't even attend the funeral. I just couldn't, not like I would've been welcome anyway."Mirabelle gulps, "W-What happened next?"Caleb inhaling his breath shaky, "After that...I shut down. I canceled my admissions, I isolated myself from everyone including Junior, who I was certain hated me then too since I got his younger brother killed, and my entire family despised me. I had nothing so...I thought I may as well return to nothing.""W-what do you mean?", Mirabelle eyes widen afraid of what he meant. Drei glances downward having a feeling what he meant from her experience during the full moon when she was treating his wounds. She saw them, the scars on his arms.Caleb reluctantly shows her his wrists and the vertical scars going down the center. Mirabelle covers her mouth in horror as tears welled in her eyes. He withdraws them slowly."I passed out from bloodloss when...I guess Junior found me and took me to the hospital. He cried so much saying he didn't blame me. I honestly couldn't believe it and was certain I was dead. But he and Vanessa...they watched over and talked to me. We didn't do any therapy we just handled everything ourselves. 6 months later after pulling myself together enough, Junior got me to re-enroll to A&M, I did those 4 years, with Summer classes. Cuz what else was I going to do? I got a job at my firm while in my Senior year and eventually graduated. I moved out of my uncle house and got my own place. The rest...is pretty much history.", Caleb explained in a hollow tone, "Now, every year, around this time, think of what I could've done. I could've gone back to Tuscaloosa! I could've went to UA like my parents wanted! I could've...I could've...went home to them. Now...they're gone. I killed them. I killed my own parents!"Caleb covers his eyes sobbing and stumbling backwards pressing his back against the stone formation of the waterfall and he slides down into a sitting position. Drei close her eyes clenching her nails into the bamboo."It all my fault. Don't try to tell it's not!", Caleb sobs his head low between his knees, " It should've been me. This is what I do, I ruin people's lives and act like a stupid asshole! That's who I am! I don't even care if I die. If there's a hell I'm gonna burn there anyway. It wouldn't even matter. What's one more dead black guy right?"He continues to sob before feeling a pair of soft hands against his own. He looks up seeing Mirabelle with tears streaming down her face with sorrow in her eyes."Wrong. You're so bloody wrong!", Mirabelle stated through choked whimper squeezing his wrists tight, "That's not who you are or EVER were or EVER will be! I'm so, so sorry for everything you've been through. And despite what you tell yourself, you...are not...a monster. You're not a stupid! You're not an asshole! And you are certainly NOT a murderer! Any goon who is any of those would not cry, they would no feel regret for something they didn't mean to do. They wouldn't listen to or care about others different from them. They wouldn't care when others are in pain. But most of all...they wouldn't have fallen in love with someone like me. Nor would someone like me...still love them back."Caleb gives a surprised look, "What?""You heard me.", Mirabelle affirms clasping her hands around his, "I've seen who you are in your dreams Dear. The pain you feel is not a selfish one it's one of genuine guilt. Despite all you've been through, you still have such a beautiful soul. Even with the scars you have inside...and out.", she emphasizes the last part by kissing both arm scars, "You must forgive yourself Dear.""Moon pie...I don't deserve it. I can never forgive myself.", Caleb sadly admits."Well...then I'll do it for you.", Mirabelle says much to his surprise, "I'll do it a hundred times. If that's not enough, I'll do it a thousand! If THAT'S not enough, I'll do it a MILLION! However many time it takes for you to accept it! You are worth it and you deserve it my love.""Moon pie...""You know what? I'm starting to believe destiny IS as real as Camilla says. If you had chosen to return to Tuscaloosa, I never would have found the man I love. I can't imagine what would have happened to Lyca and Camilla. It may not have been under the best circumstances but meeting you was fate Dear.", Mirabelle affirm gently stroking his hand then looking in the eye, " So please...never say you don't care if you die ever again. I would care and so would the others and perhaps even more than that! You're NOT 'another black guy'. You are my hero that saved my life and continues to do so everyday."Caleb stares flabbergasted at the conviction in her eyes, "What if I end up becoming so weak I can't support anymore? ""Well, a wise person once told me that the best supports come from TWO stable structures. I believe he's a engineer and a cute one. ", she answers with a playful wink. Caleb eyes widen in surprise. She didn't forget, "We'll keep leaning on each other and we'll keep moving forward together Dear!""Moon pie...I...I...", Caleb jaw quivers as tears flowed down his cheeks feeling a whirlpool of emotions, "I really wish we met much, much sooner! Maybe then-""*poke* begone bad thoughts!", Mirabelle stops him poking his forehead as Caleb gives her a surprised look, "That doesn't matter because now we ARE together. Better late than never as they say."Caleb chuckles with a smile as he wipes his tears, "Aw come on, don't take all my best lines. They're all I got.""Sorry, great people need to be quoted. Besides, you'll come up with much better ones later on.", Mirabelle giggles touching her forehead to his as they share a tearful laugh together. Drei watches them a small grin crossing her lips as she stops the recording. Maybe some escort missions weren't so bad.The couple stand to their feet hand in hand staring into each others eyes as the sound of the flowing waters fade into the background. They feel a magnetic force beckoning them closer as they lean in with half lidded eyes. The moment their lips connects a surge of electricity between them as if completing a love circuit. They separate staring blankly at the other. Mirabelle feels the ache in core getting more intense as Caleb feels his primal side coming to the surface.Caleb opens his mouth attempting to speak as Mirabelle does the same. As if nonverbally saying 'Fuck it', the two lunge at each other embracing into an intense, passionate makeout session.LemonsMirabelle wraps her arms firmly around his neck plunging her tongue into his mouth. She could feel Caleb hugging her tight as he tasted every bit of her sweet saliva. Their hands wandered around caressing and groping one another as they wrestled for dominance over the other. Caleb was surprised as she was normally more submissive but he didn't complain even welcomed the change. He feels her hands caress and squeeze his butt as he traced up her back and running his hand through her silky soft hair. The sucking and smacking of their lips filled their ears fueling their carnal desire. Caleb separates with a strand of saliva connecting them before attacking her neck line with rough kisses and nibbles inciting louder moans from her.Drei watches with a raised eyebrow before taking out her phone again for a second recording. Then taking out pack of Skittles quietly opening it with her teeth.Mirabelle grabs Caleb's shoulders pushing him until his back was against the rocky surface next to the splashing waterfall. She plunges back into another hungry, passionate kiss as she quickly removes her longsleeve tossing to the ground then snaking her hand up his black Adidas shirt tracing his firm abs. Caleb senses knowing what she wanted and proceeds to remove his shirt over his head tossing it aside showing his firm chest. Mirabelle follows his lead removing her purple shirt showing her Double Ds in their purple satin prison which she yanks up letting her bare breasts with erect red nipples bounce freely. She mushes her breast to his chest as Caleb shudders from her nipples scraping his skin and not even caring about the cold hard rock against his back.Mirabelle kisses and sucks at his neck while her hands drifted to his pants making him moan her name. She parts from quickly kneeling down then impatiently undoing his belt and unzipping him. His rockhard manhood springs out from his underwear as she grins lewdly at the masculine scent before greedily taking the tip in her mouth while stroking his shaft . She swirls her tongue around his tip proceeding to take him in as far as she could. She slurps and pumps her head back and forth gripping his rear for support."Hahhh...Hannnghh ...Moon pie...", Caleb moans throwing his head up to the sky feeling himself hitting the back of her throat and her hot wet muscles swirling around him.Suddenly, Mirabelle slides off his cock with a 'pop' leave it coated in her saliva much to his confusion. She looks up with unbridled lust and adoration before standing back up staring at him longingly. She then unhooks the buckle around her waist spreading the skirt apart revealing her soaking wet front pussy; nearly hairless save for V-shaped purple fur. Caleb swallows taking in the beautiful sight before she presses her breasts against him plunging into another passionate kiss while stroking him. She aligns her lower half with his. Caleb eyes widen feeling his tip glide against her slippery opening forcing him to pull back."W-wait! Moon pie...", Caleb stops feeling Mirabelle grip his shoulders."It's ok, Caleb. I love you. I love you and wanted you so badly...for so long. I just can't wait any longer. Please, it's ok.", Mirabelle says her eyes welling up. Drei ceases eating her Skittles awaiting his reaction.Caleb pauses at the amount of sincerity and pure untainted love present in her words. This woman right in front of him loves him. Even after he just exposed the ugliest and vile parts of his soul, she STILL loves him. It was too good for someone like him. He did nothing to earn it or deserve it and yet it was still given to him. So why? WHY does this damn law exist?! A law that prevents two CONCENTING people from showing their love for each other. IT'S LUDICROUS! You know what? Fuck it!"You're right, Mirabelle.", Caleb replies much to her surprise and Dreis intrigue, "And it's about time how much I showed you how much I love you too.", he says grabbing her sides and lining up his hips before slowing pushing in his tip spreading her lips. Mirabelle eyes shot wide gasping and holding him as she trembles feeling his cock inside her for the first time. He marvels at the hot, wet velvet-like, tightness around his member. Caleb hits some blockage guessing it was her hymen. He stops before Mirabelle looks up at him with the gem-like purple eyes and warm smile."It's ok. Please...mark me as yours.", Mirabelle spoke encouragingly almost begging her hand instinctively placed over to hoof mark on his chest.Caleb nods loving kissing before thrusting inwards tearing her hymen and claiming her virginity."AHH...Hnnnghh!", Mirabelle yelps with a strain gripping his shoulders tighter. Caleb then notices the blood dripping from her opening and is immediately concerned."A-Are you alright?! I'm sorry, I-", Caleb stops when she kisses lips."I-I'm fine Dear. It's s-supposed to hnngh hurt at first. I just nngh need a minute.", Mirabelle assurses straining as tears roll down her cheeks.Caleb leans in kissing her tears away making her smile, "Ok."After several seconds of adjusting to the pain, Mirabelle told him he could move again. He starts off slowly thrusting in and out. The pain she felt soon faded away being replaced by sheer pleasure. Her blissful moans fill Caleb's ears encouraging him to keep going. At this point, Drei saw no more reason to stay and watch and chose to keep watch for them. She'll deal with the aftermath of their decisions later. Also, she needed to go get a few things."~Hahhh..hahhh...yes...yes... Dear...this feels so good!~", Mirabelle moans in bliss holding on to his shoulder and locking her front legs around his own. They knowledge of being filled up by the man she loved was a dream come true. She moves her hips attempting to match his rhythm and driving his member deeper into her."Yeah...hahhHHHH! You're so hot and tight! Haahhh holy fuck this feels amazing!", Caleb pants picking up the pace a bit and enjoying her hot pulsating walls gripping every inch of his member."AHHH I'm so happyyyahh you love it! Go faster! HARDER! Drive my phany(vagina) mad!", Mirabelle screams through ragged breath.Caleb obliges thrusting harder and quickening his pace allowing him to bury himself almost all the way to the hilt. She buries her face in his shoulder as tears of happiness trickle on his skin and her breasts mush into his chest undulating with ever thrust he made. Caleb grabs her hips tighter thrusting even harder into her as his tip hits the opening of her womb. Wave after wave of pleasure ripples through their bodies as Caleb feels his limit approaching."NNNGHHAHH Mirabelle! I'm at my limit I can't hold it!", Caleb warns before attempting to pull out of her. Mirabelle eyes widen in realization."NO!", Mirabelle stated using her front legs to force him back inside her before wrapping her arms around his neck undulating her hips wantingly."Moon pie what are you-!""Don't go! PLEASE!", Mirabelle beg mushing her breasts into him, "It's fine! Cum inside me! I want it! I promise it's fine!Caleb wanted to retort but feels her quivering walls clamps around him inciting him to keep thrusting into her until."HAHHH AH FUCK, MIRABELLLLLLE!""HNNAAHH OH CALEB AAAHHHHNNGGH!"The two of them bellowed to the sky as their orgasms hit. Caleb unloaded a ton of his spunk, a lot more than even he expected, into her and Mirabelle drenching his cock and the crotch of his pants in her love nectar. Mirabelle body tenses as her eye glow a bright purple and faint purple aura swirls around her before quickly disappearing" *pant* *pant* ah...hahh...hahh", Mirabelle pants her sweat-covered upper body trembling before pulling off Caleb meeting him face-to-face with half lidded eyes.Caleb slips himself out of her taking a moment to catch his breath, "Hahhh...that was...haa incredible."Mirabelle smiles cheeks flushed in satisfaction, "Yes...hahh...it certainly was.""Hah, but...why did you do that? Why did you let me come inside of you? Aren't you afraid of getting pregnant?!", Caleb asks becoming worried."Dear, I told you, it's fine. My species is only fertile once every 4 months out of the year and THIS month isn't one of them. It's perfectly safe.", Mirabelle explains planting a loving kiss on his lips."Well...if you say so.", Caleb relented deciding to trust her before gliding his hand up her smooth back smirking at her, "Then I guess we can keep going."Mirabelle looks down to see he was still hard a smile crossing her lips, "Oooh somebody's feeling especially randy today! ~Good, because I have been meaning to punish you for making all pent up for almost a fortnight.~"Caleb slyly smirks caressing her cheek, "In that case ...*zoom*... allow me to begin my penance by finishing what was stated a few weeks ago.", he says teleporting directly behind her an placing both hands on her rear. Mirabelle looks to him in anticipation and surprise."D-Dear-EEE!", Mirabelle squeaks feeling him llfting up them of her skirt over her rear and tail.Caleb marvels at the sight of her soaking wet horse pussy already glistening from her previous orgasm and pulsating with each breath she took. Her scent was intoxicating like sweet lavender"Wow...you really were pent up.", Caleb spoke gently stroking his index and middle fingers along her dark purple lips making the Centaur tremble."D-Don't tease me! I'm WAY more sensitive there you know!", she whined cradling her breasts under her arms clenching her teeth."You don't say.", Caleb says in a mischievous tone before firmly grabbing her hips proceeding to grind his shaft against her slit, "Then maybe this will be enough to pay what I owe. What say you?""Hahhh...y-yes...", Mirabelle breathily moans."Sorry, I can't hear you.", Caleb teases gently squeezing her hips his shaft now coated in her juices."Yes! Yes! More than enough!, JUST BLOODY FUCK ME ALREADY!", Mirabelle shouted unable contain herself.Caleb aligns himself with her opening and with one quick thrusts himself as deep as he could within her. Immediately both of the are overcome by an otherworldly amount of pleasure and fulfillment as their eyes shot wides glowing with purple light. The mark on his chest glows brightly and pulsates sending ripples throughout his body before dying down. Caleb is dumbstruck at the unbelievable pleasantness his cock was surrounded by that felt a HUNDRED times better than her front pussy. He notices there was very little blood this time nor did she appear to feel any pain."HHAAAHHNNGGGHH!", Mirabelle elicits riding out her second orgasm spraying her juices on Caleb's pants much to Caleb's surprise. She places her hands to the side of the waterfall catching her breath."Did...you just..", Caleb uttered"Yes...hahhh...it was just too good...hahhhh. D-Don't stop! Keep going! I want you to feel good too.", Mirabelle urges shimmying her lower half around his member while her wispy tail wraps around his waist."Ok.", Caleb happily stated proceeding the pump himself and out churning her insides. He leans forward holding onto her firm but soft velvety smooth hips grunting in pleasure as he scraped against pulsating walls."OHHAAHH AGHHAA OH GODS! SO INTENSE! MY MIND'S GOING BLANK!", Mirabelle screams deliriously her breath ragged and head hanging low as she supports herself against the waterfall. The rushing waters partially drowning out her moans."YEAH HNNAGH! Your hnaagh back pussy is AMAZING! Holy fuck hahhhhhh!", Caleb elicits his mouth wide open pounding her with more vigor."Your wonderful toAhhh! My phany is on FIRE! Fuck me more! I want it all! I have for so long!", Mirabelle moans eyes rolling to the back of her head in ecstasy.Her words were music to Caleb's ears as he pounds her as hard and fast as he could occasionally slapping her rear or stroking her tail. Before long he could feel her walls tightening around quivering eminently."Dear! DEAR! I can't hold on AHNNNNGH.", Mirabelle shouts her voice unsteady."ME NEITHER MOON PIE!""Together! LET'S CUM TOGETHER MY LOVE!"Caleb gives a few more solid thrusts, "HAAGH MOON PIEEEEE!""DEEEEEAARRAGHHHHHH!"The two of them scream as their orgasms swept through them. Mirabelle moans loudly feeling his hot load collecting inside of her and her body faintly shimmers with purple aura. Caleb slumps against her back catching his breath before removing himself from her and falling back on his butt. Mirabelle legs trembles before giving out and she falls to her knees in exhaustion.LEMONADE"Haaa...haaa...that was...that was...holy shit...", Caleb panted in exhaustion wiping the sweat from his forehead."Hehe...haa...my thoughts...exactly...Dear.", Mirabelle panted weakly pulling herself up to look at him with a flushed grin.Caleb smiles back noticing his seed leaking out from her opening. Then seeing the pool of their pleasure juice mixture all over the grass."Well, guess this place ain't much of an Eden anymore. It's been...tainted...in a good way.", Caleb replies in a sly tone."Hmm...I would say we've added a bit of...character to this place.", Mirabelle replies he shakily gets up and transition over to her side."Yeah any more character and we'll have ourselves a story. Call it Fifty shades of Grey cuz that's how many shades I can see in our character. We should see a doctor.", Caleb joked."Bwhahahahahaha! Oh gods! How do you always know how to make me laugh?", Mirabelle heartily laughs."Because you apparently think I'm funny.", Caleb says petting her head running fingers through her hair, "Probably the only woman, besides Vanessa, who thinks I am. Mostly other I shared a joke with either thought I was a creep or it just went over their heads and called me unfunny.""What's wrong with those women?", Mirabelle asks incredulously before hugging his arm resting her head to his shoulder , "Hmph, their loss. All your funnies belong to me now."Caleb chuckles softly. The two sat basking in the afterglow listening the sound of the flowing waters and gentle cooling winds hit their sweat covered bodies."Um, Dear?", Mirabelle uttered."Yeah?""The dreams you had...were you envisioned yourself...killing those Malones and that Angel?", she spoke still looking at the waterfall."...yeah.", he spoke plainly."Dear, they can't hurt us anymore. You can't keep holding on to your hatred for what they've done or COULD'VE done! None of that is healthy and could feel it eating at your physique whenever I was in your dreamscape. You can't go on like this. I won't allow you to follow in their ways.", Mirabelle says in a serious voice.Caleb doesn't look at her, "You're right Moon pie. I just don't think I'll ever forgive them for what they've done.""Don't forgive them because THEY need it Dear. Forgive them because you need it.", Mirabelle advised laying her hand on top of his, "You don't even have to mean it. Simply thinking or saying it to yourself is enough.""Moon pie...thank you...for everything.", Caleb says turning his gaze toward, "I really wish I could introduce you to my parents. We had our issues but..they were good folks. I bet they would've loved to meet you."Mirabelle cups the side of his face making him look at her, "And they raised a wonderful son. One I'm happy to call my best friend and my lover. Besides, if your half of each of them, then I kinda already met them."Caleb smiles contently at her then notices the wet stains patches all over his pants, "Heh, looks like I've got plenty of character on me too.""As do I it seems. Though it's a little less noticeable than yours.", Mirabelle shows her black skirt with some white splotches at either end, "Looks mores like you soiled your knickers.""Ugh, yeah really need some-"Before Caleb could finish a strong gust of wind blew past them forcing them to shield their eyes. Reopening them, they were surprised to see a pack of wet wipes sitting on top of a pair of folded up biege cargo pants with a red Crimson Tide logo on it. They exchange looks before smirking having the same idea."Thanks Drei!", "Thank you Ms. Drei!", they stated simultaneously.A gentle breeze blows sending a paper airplane soaring and land in Caleb's lap. He unfolds it then gives an incredulous look before showing Mirabelle."You're welcome.", she spoke reading out the note before shaking her head, "I...have a feeling she's going to want speak with us later."Caleb leans back using his arms to support, "ohhhhh yeah."After cleaning themselves and putting their cloths back on to look more presentable to the public, the couple decided to do one last round of the gardens and took a few selfies together. Late afternoon soon rolled around and the two decided to return home.They were just walking out through the entrance as the service desk guy wave them goodbye inviting them to come back soon."Hmm, looks like the trolley doesn't come for another half hour.", Caleb says looking at his phone with his pants under his arms, "We could kill some time or...we could just...beam home.", he says doing a Star Trek gesture.Mirabelle ponders for a moment, "Actually...I had something else in minds.""What is it?"Mirabelle blushes touching her fingers together in embarassment, "...me...?""Huh? Moon pie, you'll have to speak up some.", Caleb replies."I-I said you could...ride...me?", she forces out repeatedly glancing to her back.Caleb gives a curious look, "Oh, um...""Y-You don't have to! It's silly I know...I just...", she trails feeling like a weirdo."No no! It's not that! I just never figured you'd want that. I mean...I read most Centaurs follow that medieval...Master-Knight relationship, which I always thought was weird, and seen videos of people riding them but...", Caleb says rubbing the back of his head."Yes, well, MY species are more...selective in who we choose as our rider.", Mirabelle stated with a tinge of annoyance before realizing what she said, "UHH that doesn't mean I see you as my MASTER or anything! I know you wouldn't like that but...""Hey, don't stress it I get what you mean. Sure. I'll...ride you.", Caleb says just loud enough to not raise red flags to any passerby."Really?! I-I mean thank you, Dear.", Mirabelle stated excitedly before catching herself."Yeah, but we'd need to find a route with less...traffic.", Caleb says looking around at the cars passing by to Mirabelle's disheartenment."Gotcha covered.", Drei stated as the couple finally noticing the wind weasel standing between them before stepping with her hands behind her back, "On my way here, I noticed a path with very little traffic and obstructions. It's kind of a long route but you'll get home...eventually."Caleb was about to speak but Mirabelle jumps in."That sounds perfect!", Mirabelle stated with stars in her eyes."Alright, lead the way.", Caleb shrugged.Drei leads them to a pedestrian area which was a sidewalk with a path leading into a park. Caleb recognized the area as it wasn't too far from the ICEP office which he decided to walk to like an idiot that one time. He and Mirabelle stood on the sidewalk the latter repeatedly glancing at Caleb anxiously. He noticed there were very few cars around and the occasional pedestrians walking along."You guys should be good here. Turns out they recently made this route a galloping freeway for equestrian-type liminals on certain days.", Drei spoke pointing to a yellow sign with a black silhouette of a human riding Centaur."Huh, weird...but convenient.", Caleb says raising an eyebrow."That about sums up every liminal service sponsored by ICEP.", Drei commented."Oh smashing! I can't wait Dear! Please mount me!", Mirabelle stated with the enthusiasm of a child gesturing to her horsey back. Caleb pauses wishing she phrased that differently."You heard the woman. Mount. Her.", Drei emphasizes to him as Caleb grumbles at her, "With your fly UP this time.", she finished making him flustered. Caleb looks to Mirabelle seeing the excitement in her eyes knowing he couldn't say 'no' to them.Caleb steps ups placing his hands on her firm back noticing her watching him out. He had never riden a horse before( Not that she WAS one...mostly) let alone with no saddle. He hoists himself slinging his leg over her side before straightening up himself using sides for support. He then notices her entire body trembling and the soft whimpers she made."Moon pie? What's wrong!?", Caleb inquires in concern, "Am I too heavy?""No. Not at all Dear, you're backpack full of pillows. It's just...it's just...", Mirabelle says her face bright red and trying to contain a goofy smile, "I'm so happy right now! I feel so complete."Caleb pauses before smiling, "I don't quite understand it but as long as your happy. How do we look Drei?""Like the Vanilla-version of Old Town Road!", Drei stated giving a thumbs up."Perfect, that's what I going for.", Caleb replied."Are you ready Dear?!", Mirabelle stated her legs shifting ready to go."Yeah. Let's GOWAAHHHHOHO!", Caleb hollered as she took off galloping down the street. He struggled to keep his balance from the boucing motion and leans hugging her waist to keep from falling off."I'm pulling ahead!", Drei stated from above bouncing off air bubbles she generated, "Try not to fall off!"Mirabelle slows her gallop a bit noticing how tightly he was holding her, "Is everything alright Dear?""Y-yeah! Just...gotta get myself steady here.", Caleb says raising up straightening his back which he found made him bounce less. He gets a firm grasp of her sides keeping himself steady."You're a fast learner Dear!", Mirabelle complimented."Thanks! Ok I think I got it! You can go a little faster!", Caleb says squeezing his thighs to her sides."Right!", Mirabelle obliges galloping faster her breasts bouncing wildly.The pair continued through the street turning into the entrance of the park. The clopping of hoove against stone alerting any jogger or passerby of their presence. They got quite a few curious even astonished looks even a couple of people whooping in excitement upon seeing them. As they went on, and he got the hang of it, Caleb started enjoying himself. The wind rushing pasts him, the bouncing motions, the sense of freedom flowing through him; all with the woman he loved at his side...er, so the speak."AhahaHAHAHAHA! WOOOO!", Caleb laughs and hoops enthusiastically."Hahahahah ahhaa! LALI-HOOOOO!", Mirabelle shouted their mantra with gusto."LALI-HOOOOO!", Caleb joined in raising his fists proudly as the two joined together in laughter. A few liminal couples they passed smiled at the couple raising their fists proudly too.Above them, Drei watches the couple. A small grin spreading across her lips.After about 20 minutes, they arrive at the street their house is on. They slowed to a light trot taking in the moment a little longer. They sun was beginning to set in the distance."Haaa, I changed my mind.", Mirabelle sighed contently."Hm? About what?", Caleb asks leaning in closer"This...this is the day I will treasure as long as I live.", she says turning to him with her purple orbs filled with adoration."Yeah, mine too.", Caleb replies before taking her lips unto his in a sweet kiss.Pretty soon they could see their house in sight along with the Zyklons. Caleb then notices another car parked in his driveway. It was black so he thought it might be Sterling. Upon closer inspection, he noticed the familiar dent near the gas tank. It was Uncle Junior car!"Oh. It looks like your uncle is here.", Mirabelle say as Caleb dismounts her. Drei drops down from the sky landing next to them."Yeah but wh-oh. Ohhhh right...he usually comes check up on me around...this time.", Caleb replied in a unceremonious tone.Mirabelle realized what he meant, "O-Oh. Well, that is quite nice of him. He certainly cares for you deeply.""Yeah...", Caleb replies flatly.*slap* Drei slaps Caleb on the butt to his and Mirabelle surprise."Ah! Hey!"" 'Hey!' yourself. Out of the ballsy crap you chose to do today THIS is too much you?", Drei inquired giving him a serious but kind look, "The man's your family. You have no reason not to let him know you're doing ok."Caleb gives her a thoughtful look before inhaling, "You're right.", he says before walking up to the front door with the two liminals beside him.They could make out what sounded like people laughing from inside. Glancing to Mirabelle and Drei questioningly he takes out his key and unlocks the door. Stepping inside they could see his uncle sitting at the couch laughing heartily with Zwei and Lyca sitting on each side and Camilla and Ein standing behind him; all of them laughing hysterically. They don't notice them at the door."Uhh, heh we're home.", Caleb announces loud enough for them to hear.Uncle Junior and the girls all turned to him."Chief!" "Señor!" "Mr. Bizzell!" "Boss!" , They each stated in unison."Eyyy there nephew! I missed you this morning!", Junior spoke raising up from his seat with his cane and going over to Caleb, "How you feeling today? You alright?"Caleb smiles at him, "I'm doing good! I mean, yeah, today was great. Thanks for coming to check on me. Like always."Junior looks surprised for moment then smiles back, "That's good! I'm real glad to hear that.""Chief!", Lyca stated running up and hugging him tightly then looks up with quivering eyes, "I want you to know I don't care what ANYONE says about you! You're my mate and you're a good person! That's all that matters!""I feel the same way Señor!", Camilla fervently stated placing her hand over her heart, "Whatever happened in your past, it does not change how I feel about ju! What happened to your parents...it was not your fault! Ju must believe that!""Wait, what?!", Caleb stated incredulously pulling out of Lyca's grip, "H-How do you guys even know about it?!""I told'em.", Junior spoke up much to Caleb and Mirabelle surprise, "They let me in. I fount they were all been worryin' about you seeing you all depressed. So I told them what you goin' through.""W...Why would you-?!", Caleb started"Because they LOVE YOU, BOY!", Junior cuts him off making Caleb go quiet."Whoa whoa whoa! Hang on now, w-we were just worried cuz we're his BODYGUARDS! That's all!", Zwei cleared up with a blush in her cheeks."T-That's right! He's a nice guy but we're strictly professional in our relationship!", Ein waves off blushing nervously.Junior looks to them confused, "I know. I was talkin' them three.", he gestures to Mirabelle, Camilla, and Lyca.The twister sisters pause with blank expressions."Right. Just making sure that's clear.", Zwei assures sounding slightly wooden."Yes, same here.", Ein agrees equally as wooden."And the razzberry goes too...", Drei discetely and very sarcastically compliments them."Anyway, THESE girls love you and it was only right that they know. Babygirl over there sho'nough should know!", Junior stated looking to Mirabelle."Actually he...told me...everything earlier.", Mirabelle admitted much to Junior and the other surprise."Yeah...I did. I was..going to tell Lyca and Camilla too (eventually) so...guess you beat me to it.", Caleb says facing everyone, "hahhh listen guys...I didn't mean to make you worry. I've just been dealing with it the way I always have...before you all came into my life. I guess I was just too hardheaded to remember...that I wasn't alone anymore. I'm sorry.""There is nothing to apologize for Señor.", Camilla says going to his side, "I completely understand why ju didn't want to tell ua. But as we said before it does not change how feel about ju.""If anything, it makes us love you even more. Whatever bad memories you have, we'll add tons more good ones in their place! Starting now!", Lyca emphasizes roughly nuzzling his chest."I second that!", Mirabelle emphasizes hugging him from behind mushing her orbs into him."Wha-h-hey now!", Caleb stuttered as an embarassed smile forms.Kyyahahahehe boy I tell you truth, you don't know how blessed you is.", Junior chortles slapping his knee."Haha, believe me I find it hard o believe myself sometimes.", Caleb says petting the top of Lyca's head. Her smiling happily as it felt genuine, kind, and strong; as her 'Chief' should be. A thought suddenly crosses Caleb's mind, "Oh, by the way, what were you guys laughing about that was so funny?""Oh, we were look at your pictures Chief!", Lyca stated before going over to sit with Junior."Pictures? What pict-", Caleb eyes widen in realization, "...no.""Hope you don't mind nephew, but I needed a picture out of the family photo album to use for a program at church. Then me and the girls sat down and went through it a bit.", Junior stated pulling out the large leather bound book from Caleb's office."No.", Caleb utters in shock."Hahahahaha seriously ho-ly crap! What made think this was a good Picture Day outfit?!", Zwei chortled pointing at a picture of him, "You look like a Cookies&Creme cowboy!""Well...*snort* he does look proud of himself tipping his little...cow pattern hat.", Ein says barely containing her chuckles."Nooo.", he repeated."Wait?! Are there any from...w-when Dear was a baby?!", Mirabelle inquires eyes sparkling"Si, tons! Ohohohohooo let's me show my favorite when he's in a little Devil costume!", Camilla swoons side to side going over to Junior showing the photo to which Mirabelle also swoons at the cuteness."Nooo.", Caleb repeated holding the sides of his head in despair."HAhahhakyaha now...now let me show y'all the time this turrible boy got himself covered in pot of spaghetti I made!", Junior chuckles hysterically."NOOOOOOO!", Caleb wails to the ceiling catching their attention.Drei dangles over the couch and nudges Junior shoulder, "Show it anyway *munch*" , she urges muching on a can of Pringles as Caleb continues to wail.Junior obliges turning the page as he and the girls burst into laughter while Caleb collapses to the floor in defeat.WRHey Fam! Welp, here we are! Two year. TWO. YEARS! And the dreamscape couple finally have SEX! Man writing this one was fun. Finally got to Caleb's backstory and finally worked in FIVE original Star Trek references in ONE chapter! In case you couldn't tell, I'm reeallly proud of this one. Makes me wonder how I'll top it?

    Chapter Text
    Chapter 37: Second Opinion...7 hours earlier...Camilla, Lyca, and the other two Zyklons watch while the the pair and Drei leave out the front door. The sound appears to ring out through the room. The Demoness and She-wolf smiles morph to worried frowns. Lyca goes over to the window watching the pair board the trolley."I hope they'll be alright. I'm really worried about Chief.", Lyca says her ears dropping downwards staring outside."Sigh, me too Señora.", Camilla sighs taking a seat on one of the stools looking of contemplatively."If what Ms. Marequine said is true, perhaps a day out in soothing environment could ease his mental stress.", Ein says crossing her legs and arms leaning her back against the chair, "Between the trauma he's experienced and guilt he feels on top of whatever issues he had before...""I wish I never mentioned anything about his family. I should have have known it was tough subject for him.", Zwei spoke regretfully gripping the cushion."Hahh it's not entirely your fault Zwei. Mr. Bizzell is going through likely runs deeper than what we were briefed on. I just wish we had more to go on.", Ein replies hardly putting Zwei at ease."Hmmm maybe there is something in Señor's room or his office that could give us an answer.", Camilla hypothesized raising from her seat heading to the hallway entrance before Ein quickly blocks her way."W-Wait! You can't just go snooping around his stuff!", Ein stated"It is NOT 'snooping'. I merely wish to learn more about mi Amor by looking through his stuff without his permission. It is mi right as his lover.", Camilla affirms."Ah, the unspoken 'Wife's law'-'what's yours and yours and what's his is yours.'. Mama Jiang would approve.", Zwei spoke fondly earning a glare from Ein at her unhelpfulness."Wouldn't that apply to me too?", Lyca inquires pointing to herself."Of course Seno-", Camilla started but Ein interrupts."It doesn't matter who APPLIES. It's a matter of common decency! Where are your respect for privacy?!", Ein stated incredulously."Really? The woman who's entire job revolves around spying and being sneaky wants to lecture us about privacy?", Camilla crosses her arms sassily raising an eyebrow."That's different and you know it!", Ein shot back."What I KNOW is mi amor is in pain. Did ju not see it his eyes? Even if he is angry at me for doing so, I still wish to know more about him so maybe we can help him.", Camilla replies in a worried tone."I understand but you don't know why he wishes to hide it. Wouldn't you rather he open up voluntarily than being forced to because we put what he's hiding out in the open? We'll just do more harm than good.", Ein explained as Lyca and Zwei look at her in realization that she was right. Even Camilla was forced to concede."Then what do ju suggest we do?", Camilla half demands giving a serious."I...I don't know. Honestly, I've never been good with these things.", Ein admits casting her gaze to the side.The room goes quiet as they all ponder on what to do not really coming up with a concrete solution."Well...since we all got nothing, why don't put our bets that his date with Marequine will put him in a better mood and just focus on yourselves for now. No point in you two being all crestfallen when he returns, right? Despite his mood, he still wants you guys to be happy. Show him he's succeeding by greeting him with a genuine smile when he returns.", Zwei suggested earning a surprised look from the rest."Huh? It's always strange hearing you say something logical.", Ein teases as Camilla agrees.Zwei flips them off, "Screw you guys! Anyway, hey Lycs? Wanna play Injustice 2?", the weasel spoke offering the other controller to the She-wolf."Uhh y-yeah!", Lyca says changing their tone before joining Zwei on the couch as they switch the tv to auxiliary and power on the PS4. The title screen for the game comes up, "Ooh, I wanna be the Catwoman!""Sure, I don't see the irony in that.", Zwei joked.Ein shakes her then turns to Camilla who shrugs deciding to follow their lead and just relax for now.A couple hours passed. Zwei and Lyca eventually switched games deciding to RDR2 deciding to play one of Caleb's save files. Meanwhile, Camilla went off to her room for awhile to do some much needed meditation while Ein double checked to make sure things were secured next door and around the perimeter.Now the girls were all near the living room doing their own thing. Zwei and Lyca still taking turns on RDR2 both very engaged with story and world. Camilla sat at the counter studying her English reading skills with the templates Caleb made for her along with the book they've been occasionally reading together. Ein was on her laptop looking up methods to deal with girl-on-girl sexual harassment; for...future purposes.*Ding Ding*The doorbell rings alerting the girls. Ein puts her laptop away cautiously goes to answer it."Ah. H-Hello...er, other Mr. Bizzell.", Ein clumsily greets as Lyca and the others turn in her direction."Hey there...shoot I done forgot your name.", came the hearty voice of Caleb's uncle as he casually strolls on in despite Eins reservations, "I know you, Zwei, and the other little one. I'll just call ya Small, Medium, and Large. Heheheheheheheh!", he heartily chuckles.Ein cracks an embarassed smile, "Er, yes, heheh that's certainly-""UNCLE JUNIOR!", Lyca shouted happily bounding over to the old man hugging and nuzzling him as her tail wags furiously. Ein closes and locks the door."Ayyy there pup!", Junior stated hugging and petting her head to her delight, "How you doing?""I'm doing good! Me and Zwei were just playing this game called Red Dead Redemption 2!", Lyca stated pointing to the tv screen that Zwei currently had paused."Child I don't know nothin' about that stuff", The man casually dismisses before noticing Camilla sitting at the counter silently watching him. He gives her a smile, "And how you doing?""I am fine, gracias.", Camilla politely answers as he nods in approval."Excuse me, sir? I don't mean to sound rude but, why are you here?", Ein questioned.Junior pulls away from Lyca, "I dropped by to pick up something for church and to check up on Caleb. Where he at? In the back working? Or do he go in the office today? Hadn't been keeping track."Ein looks to Zwei who shrugs before answering, "Well, um...Caleb has left with Ms. Marequine and my sister today. He should be back later."Junior gave a surprised look, "Oh, gone out? That's good. I was worried he'd just close himself off all day. You know, around this time...is real hard on him so I try to make sure he's alright."Ein and the others give him a surprised looks."Well...lately...Chief has been really, really sad. He tries not to show it or just brushes it off when we ask but...", Lyca admitted despondently, "We're all very worried about him."Junior is taken aback slightly while the other girls reluctantly agreed with her through body language and just nodding. The old man rubs his chin in thought."Let me ask y'all somethin'.", Junior stated catching their attention, "Do Caleb ever mention anything about his mama, his daddy, his brother, his sister, or anybody else in the family?""No...he doesn't like to talk about his family, other than you or your daughter.", Zwei answered as Junior hums to himself closing his eyes."Por fa vor...", Camilla speaks getting the man's attention, "If ju know why Señor is acting this way, tell us. We just...we just want to help him.", she spoke sincerely barely containing the sadness in her voice.Junior sighs then goes over to the couch much to their confusion and sits down next to Zwei. He hunches forward clasping his hands together pensive"This oughtta be somethin' he should tell y'all himself...but I know he won't. Too hardheaded like his daddy.", He spoke forlornly, "Let me tell y'all something you probably don't know about my nephew."Camilla and the others eyes widen as they gather around the living room to listen in.Junior spends the next hour or so regailing the girls on what Caleb was like growing up as a child a and what he's been through; at least what he heard Caleb's parents. He told them about his old high school in Tuscaloosa and how he didn't exactly get along with the other students. He didn't make any friends or get along with his peers and even gotten into a fights with some of the upperclassmen. His grades were slipping and he was distant towards everybody. The girls were especially surprised he had even begun stealing from stores even vandalizing school property a few times and was eventually caught in the act. His parents were especially furious, as they should have been, and explained how Caleb eventually ended up in his care along with Vanessa."Wait, so they just...forced him to stay with you?!", Zwei questioned with an incredulous tone as the others continued to listen."No no! They were worried about him but with their jobs and a mortage to pay on their new house, his brother needing support moving out, and paying for sister his sister need for college out of state, it was a lot on them. They already weren't to welcome in they new neighborhood.", Junior explained."Why was that?", Camilla inquired."Ah you know how it is, new folks move in from deep in the country then buy a big house. People be nosy, especially black folk and don't wanna see others make it. That stuff Caleb did? Mannn I tell you they was just waiting on somethin' like that. Cuz that reflect poorly on them as parents give these people something to really talk about. I remember my sister calling me crying about how they talk about her and how she 'failing as a mother'.", Junior pauses as the girls listen on with Camilla especially pondering over the last statement, " Part of the reason they sent him to me was they didn't want him to get into more trouble and because things were getting worse around where they were. Hell I didn't mind. After my wife passed, the house became more empty. I enjoyed him there with Vanessa, even got him to open up why he was actin' up.""So why did Cheif do all those things?", Lyca asks expectanty."Short of it is, he was insecure. He compare himself to much to them other boys who carry on acting, not trying to do nothin but act a fool and mess with girls. I told him to keep his head in the books! Don't worry about being men like THEM cuz those are BOYS not men! I could tell he just needed more confidence in himself so I took him down to my friend's dojo and started him on Judo training. Nothin' raises confidence more than knowing you could give somebody a ass whoopin' when they need it. ", Junior chuckles lightly."Agreed.", Camilla voices her approval as Ein gives her a 'really?' look."Heheheh she knows what I'm talkin' about.", Junior chortles.Junior then proceeds to talk fondly about Caleb slowly growing more comfortable and confident in his new environment. Going to Vanessa school meant he had fewer bullies, martial arts training kept him in shape, and, even though he clearly wasn't into it, got Caleb to come to church sometimes. He noted how Caleb interest in science led Junior to buy Caleb some robotic kits other STEM related projects to explore his interest further. The tone soon shifts when Junior mentions how strained Caleb's relationship with his parents became and the frequent arguments they would have. A couple of time Caleb's father accusing Junior of 'turning him against them' which Junior, and even his sister, found ridiculous. He explained how they wanted Caleb to return home since things in the neighborhood were calming down and...they just missed their youngest baby. He tried talking to Caleb about it but he was always hesitant about going home. He knew Caleb likely still felt like an embarassment to them and his presence would just make things hard for them again; especially considering how well off his brother(a music producer) and sister(working on he MBA) were without him.Then, he gets to Caleb and Vanessa high school graduation. Caleb wanted for his parents to be there but they refused since at the time they were in midst of finishing their payments on the house and had to put in more time for work. Then there was the fact that Caleb had decided to attend A&M in Huntsville instead of going to UA like they wanted so he could be closer them. What followed was by far their worst argument yet. Both sides hurling stuff back and forth then...he told them what Caleb said to his parents before hanging up."C-Chief...said that?", Lyca uttered profoundly shocked as were the others."Yeah...", Junior answered plainly."W-What happened after that?", Zwei nervously asks."I got on his butt about it, what you think?! You don't say no shit like that to yo parents! I let him know he wrong for that!", Junior stated sounding a little irritated, "Now my sister and brother, THEY was wrong too! They shouldn't have tried to force him to go there! Then you got his dad threatening say he won't pay a dime on anything at that school he wanted to go to. Boy I tell you damn...wouldn't no need for none of that. It wouldn't. Sister crying on the phone thinking her baby hated her...", Junior sighs rubbing his head."I'm sorry you were caught in the middle of all that sir. I realize this is difficult to discuss.", Ein apologizes seeing they were bringing up bad memories."Oh, no no, it's alright. I was just trying to keep the peace between'em.""What happened after that?", Lyca inquires as Junior expression goes dark much to her concern.Junior proceeds to tell them about the day of graduation. It was a nice day of celebration and congratulations for both Caleb and Vanessa. Caleb admitted that he felt awful about what he said to his parents and told Junior he wanted to spend the Summer with them until Fall semester started. However, what he didn't tell Caleb was he spoke to his parents and they decided to surprise Caleb when he returned to Junior house. Junior was hoping to finally put an end to that bad blood. That was until they returned home and were greeted by a state trooper informing him and the two children that his parents had been killed in an accident on the interstate. Lyca, Camilla, and the Zyklons were immediately shocked and saddened to hear that.It was very hard on Junior since he had just lost his little sister and brother-in-law but especially for Caleb. The young man shut down afterwards falling into grief even blaming himself for what happened despite Junior's objections. What's worse, his siblings, who were aware of the frequent arguments their parents had with him, and the rest of the Bizzell family found out about their last argument and what Caleb said to them. Junior watched as they all turned on him even though it was later found out autopsy that the truck driver who caused the accident had traces of an unknown amphetamine in his system. They still blamed him for putting them out there out of guilt in the first place. He mentions at one point Caleb older brother(Nate) came barging in proceeding to beat up Caleb until Junior steps in and pulls him off. He tells them about the funeral and how Caleb couldn't bare to attend so only he and Vanessa went. The service was relatively short and also closed casket. He and Vanessa got some looks of disgust from a few family members for allowing a murderer to stay in their home. At one point, when the recessional was over, Vanessa nearly got into a fight with Caleb sister(Tamika) before a few people had to hold them back. They returned home not even bothering to stay for food. When they returned home, Caleb was still locked away in his room haven't moved since they left and barely talking or wanting to know about the funeral so they decided to leave him alone. Junior even regretfully admitted that, at one point, he was starting to believe what the others said about Caleb but he decided not to show it. CamillaAlmost a week later, Junior met with his older sister(Caleb's Aunt Bernice), Nate, Tamika and several others to discuss inheritance. Caleb's parents had left the house to his older brother and sister with only nine more payments left on the mortgage and Caleb was given all their mementos; photos, silverware, his dad's vintage album collection, to name a few. Along with $30,000 in leftover insurance to be distributed among the three children. His siblings were not happy about not only have to split with the guy responsible for all of this and didn't even bother to show his face but the fact that their parents left him ALL of their valuable and sentimental possessions. Eventually, Junior and the Aunt Bernice managed to calm them down and they managed to get things settled...mostly.Then Juniors voice grows more sullen, which the girls sensed, as he explains what happened when he returned home to tell Caleb what happened."Now...Vanessa...she had gone out to get them somethin' to eat and I figured Caleb was still in his room. He wasn't in there. I called him all throughout the house but he didn't answer. Then...I notice the light on in the bathroom and this...red liquid pooling at the bottom.", Junior spoke morosely as the girls eyed him with fearful eyes and a sinking feeling in their stomachs, "I open the door found him sitting against the wall unconcious...both his arms just cut open and bleedin' out...sniff", Junior wipes his face and the tears from his eyes.Lyca, Camilla, and the Zyklons were taken aback by the information. The She-wolf and Elder Devil horrified at the image of the man they loved committing suicide while both clearly weren't expecting it either. None of them could conjure the right words to express their shock."I called the ambulance and told...Vanessa what had happened. The doctor said that...he lost so much blood that if he had arrrived 20 minutes late...he would've been gone.", Junior finishes in a cold tone."Diablos mia...", Camilla softly uttered hand covering her mouth.Lyca stares wordlessly as tears welled in her eyes and her ears dropped lowly to her head. Ein and Zwei wore varying degrees of remorse with the latter discretely wiping a tear away."I...I contacted his brother and sister and let them know what happened to him and come visit him. You know what they did?", Junior asks his voice growing deep as the girl listen intently."What?", Ein spoke nervously.Junior grips his hands tightly, "They said they were glad."Their eyes widen in absolute shock and appall."They talking about he deserved it for what he did to their parents.", Junior continued.Camilla clenches her fist enraged upon hearing that while Lyca shook her head in disbelief as memories of her own siblings came flooding back. Ein and Zwei looked especially appalled and disgusted by their behavior."B-But it wasn't his fault! It was that truck who was under the influence of an illegal substance. Their anger and blame should've rested on him NOT Mr. Bizzell!", Ein stated vehemently as Camilla and the others agreed."We WERE angry at him; I still won't ever forgive his ass! But he was killed in the accident too. That man had no family, no assets, and already had a history of drug abuse and a violent temper. Another fool that should've never been ON the road.", Junior stated in a bitter tone."Then why would they still blame Señor?!", Camilla demandingly slapping the couch and surprising Junior and the others."Listen, my sister and brother-in-law had been having a bunch of arguments with Caleb since he left to live with me. It's only natural others in the family WOULD get imvolved; especially their eldest children. Naturally, they mostly took the parents side and say that Caleb in the wrong. Plus, all that mess he got himself into THEN telling them to 'go to hell'...well that gave'em more reason to think HE put in harms way by making them get on the road with that fool.", Junior explained not approving of his family's actions. The girls each seemed particularly disturbed and digusted by their behavior."Anyway", Junior continued, "After that, he spent a couple weeks in recovery and on suicide watch. They suggested therapy but this was somethin' family needed to deal with and we didn't want him believing he was crazy. We stayed on him and finally got him to talk about everything.", Junior explained."Did it...help?", Ein asks cautiously."It did...some at least. We tried showin' him it wasn't his fault just an accident caused by some drugged up fool... but he still blamed himself. Next thing I know, he cancelled his admission to A&M along with his full scholarship! I wasn't mad. I didn't yell at him or nothin', I just let him take his time to grieve but I made sure he don't stay there too long. A young man needs to stay busy, keep his mind together, do somethin' with themselves. He real smart and good at that engineering. I didn't want him to waste that talent. After a while, he started doing a lot better. Vanessa helped support up until she had to go to her college up state. He still did good in all his classes and the money he was left helped pay for stuff grants didn't cover. Then he got a job at that firm he at now until he graduated. I helped him move out and find this place here; close where I can get to him", Junior informed leaning against the couch turning a thoughtful gaze upward, "Despite all that, I knew deep down he still had that hate toward himself in his heart. I could see it on him. Like...his eyes had no life in'em. I did my best because I NEVER wanted to find him how I did in my bathroom. I even had the whole bathroom remodeled be it reminded me too much of it. I want him to be happy with his life and I'm certain my sister would want the same.", Junior sighs softly before feeling a hand on his shoulder then to see Ein with an understanding smile."Well, sir, I can safely say you've done an amazing job. Caleb is extremely lucky to have such a dedicated and caring uncle like you.", Zwei affirms."She's right! You saved Chief's life in more ways than one! Believe me, I know what it's like being hated by your own family...", Lyca spoke somberly before cracking a smile, "But...sometimes all it takes is ONE who really loves you to change who you are.""Lyca's right! We're so sorry for all you and Caleb have been through. He's incredibly fortunate to have a family like you and your daughter in his life.", Ein added in a solemn tone."Regardless of what ANYONE believes, Señor is a kind and wonderful person. I...cannot thank ju enough for everything you've done for him. If it weren't for ju, he would never have met me, and I cannot imagine what mi life would have been. So...muchas gracias, Tío del señor(Lit. 'Señor's uncle')", Camilla chimes in showing her gratitude to the elderly man much to his slight surprise.Juniors looks around at them a second before a smile spread over his face, "Heheheh, y'all are somethin' else. I tell ya one thing, He sho'nough changed ever since all y'all came into his life."The statement caught the girls off guard."E-Ehh?! What do you mean?", Ein stated slightly embarassed."I mean before you and your sisters, baby girl(Mirabelle), ol'pup, and miss Camilla over here came along I ain't seen look as happy as he is now. Before, he always looked, sounded, and got around like he was half alive. He hardly ever cooked, hell I didn't know he COULD til' baby girl showed up. He barely ever went out except for work. Even his eyes are different. It reminds me of when him, me, and Vanessa would go out together and have a good time.", Junior stated genuinely before looking to each of the girls, "What I'm trying to say is, thank you. My nephew been blessed with some fine women in his life."Camilla and the others pause taking in the compliment as each of their cheeks flush followed by a small appreciative grin."Especially, you two and baby girl.", Junior stated looking to Camilla and Lyca, "I know y'all really love him so I'm asking you both and her to take care of him. I know HIS job is to take care of y'all and all that but still. That same for you two and your sister as his bodyguards.""Of course uncle! You don't need to ask! Chief is our mate so it's our JOB to take care of him and make him happy just like he takes care of us and makes us happy!", Lyca emphatically stated."You needn't worry sir! Your nephew is in our capable hands.", Ein affirms proudly."We'll do our part and more to make sure he's safe and happy!", Zwei stated assuringly slightly puffing her chest out."Exactamente correcta(Exactly right)! Do not worry young one. Though our ways are different, we each love him deeply beyond words.", Camilla emphasizes clenching her fist to her heart"Thank you pup. You too ma'am but uhh heheh I ain't no young person. I'm 67.", Junior chuckles brushing his stubble."Ju are by MY species standards.", Camilla points out raising a finger, "to me ju are an adolescent."Junior raises an intrigued eyebrow, "Really?""Yeahhh, she's got ya beat by almost a century there Yéyé( Chinese for 'gramps').", Zwei informed much to Junior surprise and Camilla's slight peave."Well damn!", Junior exclaimed glancing her up and down, "You sure lookin' good, a whooole lot better than me!""G-Gracias.", Camilla thanks him only feeling slightly disgusted by another male, that wasn't Señor, compliment her on her physical appearance."Oh! Uncle? You mentioned earlier that you came to pick something. What is it?", Lyca asks curiously.."Yeah! That's right, thank ya I just bout forgot! I need a few pictures out of the family album. I'm usin' em for a project Reverend Cherry doing this Sunday.", Junior explained grabbing his cane and standing up his back making popping sound as Lyca and Ein help support him. He thanks them as he straightens himself up."Family pictures? Wait, you mean the mementos you said they left for Boss?!", Zwei inquires curiously."Yeah, most of it he be keepin' in storage but I know he keep that book in his office somewhere. One of y'all mind helping me look?", Junior requested as Ein grows concerned."I'll help! I can probably sniff it out.", Lyca stated rubbing her nose proudly following behind him."S-Sir, forgive me, but you can't just go rummaging through your nephew's belongings without his permission!", Ein contended"And why not?", Junior stated in a deep, serious tone."B-Because...it's his house? His private space?", Ein said sounding less confident than before."Child I helped that boy with his rent for five months before he was making enough to pay it all himself. You think I can't go anywhere I want in this house? You crazy. We family. Ain't no such thing as 'private space'. Come on pup, I don't know what she talkin' bout.", Junior rebutted continuing down the hall leaving a dumbstruck Ein."He's right. Heck, I'm wearing one of your bras right now.", Zwei stated pushing her breasts up with both hands as Camilla raises an eyebrow just now noticing the...bulginess of her top half."Wha-? Why?! They can't even fit you!", Ein stated in confusion and annoyance."No kidding. It takes BOTH tits to filll just one of these cups.", Zwei complains shifting the loose bra underneath her black tights, "HOW exactly is this 'too tight' for you?""Don't talk about my breasts in front of Caleb family! Take it off now!", Ein growls blushing beet red."Fine, whatever.", Zwei casually waves before squatting behind a chair out of sight. A zipper sound is heard is heard and a lace green I-cup bra goes soaring overhead then quickly caught by Ein, balled up, and quickly stuffed somewhere behind her."Huh, I figured ju more the conservative type.", Camilla remarks with a devilish smirk."Shut up.", Ein said eyes shut and cheeks flushed.Junior and Lyca soon return with the leather bound book in hand. Junior takes three of the photos out and puts them away for later."Alright, got them. I got plenty of time right now, y'all wanna look over some family photos? There plenty in here from when Cal was a baby.", Junior spoke taking a seat at the couch and flipping the book open.Each of the girls eyes light up attentively. Lyca an"S-Senor...as a baby?", Camilla uttered softly in thought as her imagination roam freely."Chief as a puppy?! I wanna see! I wanna see!", Lyca stated plopping down on Junior right while her eyes darted around the page."Whoa! Baby boss. Count me in.", Zwei stated sitting on his left also scanning the pages looking for some delicious dirt to tease him with."Zweiii ! C-Come on guys, we shouldn't do this!", Ein stated wanting to preserve Caleb's dignity."Ju do not have to join in, ju know.", Camilla spoke taking a spot standing over Junior shoulder having a good view of the entire book, "I on the otherhand accept any opportunity to learn about mi Amor.""Fine, but I will have no part in-", Ein retorted lightly blushing before Lyca interupts."Whoooaa who are they?", Lyca stated pointing at a page Junior just turned to a photo of a beautiful African American woman wearing a burgundy female Sunday dress standing in front of a church stairs. She wavy black hair that stopped at her shoulder, soft brown eyes, and a beautiful toothy smile accented with peach lipstick. Standing next to her, a handsome black man in a dark blue Sunday suit with black dress shoes and light blue dress shirt and ties. He was tall, broad built man with lowcut hair almost bald, and wore black frame glasses."Caleb's parents. That's my sister Marrian and that's her husband. That's our family home church down in Boligee.", Junior explained as Lyca, Zwei, and Camilla focused on the photo. Ein turns to them curiously."Wow, she's so pretty! And Chiefs father looks like a kind and strong mate!", Lyca stated adoringly."You tellin' me.", Zwei spoke faintly blushing, "Boss' dad is actually pretty hot. Like, wow, I wasn't prepared for that(now I see where Boss gets his butt from)."Whatcha say child? Didn't hear ya.", Junior inquired."N-Nothin' just thinking out loud hahaha.", Zwei waves off blushing nervously as Lyca giggles hearing every word she said."Ahhh Señor has his Madre's eyes.", Camilla admires referring to another larger headshot photo of his mother. Ein tries her best to fight her curiosity."Hehe yeah he do. He got them and her temper when he get mad.", Junior chuckles turning the page, "Now, right here, these from Cal was born."Camilla, Lyca, and Zwei lean in closer nearly smothering Junior their hearts fluttering upon seeing a newborn Caleb in his mother's arms or lying sprawled on a dark purple blanket."So cute!", "So cute!", "Tan linda(so cute)!", all three girls exclaims admiringly smiling with big pink hearts in their eyes. Ein inches herself closer and closer to the group."Oh my gods he was so tiny!", Lyca squeeled her tail wagging furiously as Zwei wholeheartedly agreed."Haaa Diablos mia, what is that?! What is he wearing?", Camilla inquires pointing to a baby Caleb in a Mario and Luigi full-body sweater holding his baby foot to his mouth."That's uhh...one of those uhh...swadlers! That's it! It's called a swadler.", Junior explains as Camilla croons sweetly feeling a primal desire to smother the child in her warmth. Junior turns another page chuckling as the girls squeel happily. Ein looks curiously and discretely looks over the gushing Elder Devil shoulder. Her eyes widen upon seeing a photo of Caleb as a toddler wearing little grey mouse pajama.'Ba-Dump', goes Ein's heart as warmth envelops. She clutches the her flushed red cheeks barely containing her goofy grin and delighted weasel noises.Junior to proceeds show them more of Caleb's baby pictures as the girls hearts palpitate from cuteness overload. Some of them, Junior would provide a funny story behind it which filled the room with laughter on top sound of the girls crooning and gushing. Camilla's heart absolutely melted seeing a 5-year-old Caleb dressed up in a little devil costume for Halloween. They saw more pictures of his parents and siblings but seemed to be a lot less interested in the latter than the former. Photos from preschool, middle school, high school, and college; Camilla and Lyca, even the Zyklons couldn't help feeling closer to Caleb by, in a way, seeing him grow up into who he is today which makes the pain he's endured all the more meaningful.An hour or so passes and Junior still swapping stories from the album and Camilla and Lyca sharing their experience living with Caleb. They even got snacks from the kitchen.Suddenly, the front door unlocks itself and they fail to notice the Centaur, the Small weasel, and the man himself enter in on them have a delighted at one of Junior anecdotes."Uhh, hey. We're back.", came the voice of Caleb. Junior and the girls immediately turn their attention to Caleb, Mirabelle, and Drei....Present...Caleb sat in his chair begrudgingly demeanor drinking some DD Pepper trying to ease his stress and humiliation as the group of girls and Junior giggled and chuckled at the book of embarassment."~Haaaaaa adorable~!", Mirabelle swoons happily holding her cheek with big purple hearts in her eyes admiring the photos of baby Caleb. Drei hides her mouth in her chip bag a faint shade of red in her cheeks."Right Señora?! Oh here's one of mi favorites!", Camilla quickly turning the pages to a 8-year-old Caleb with a big afro, holding a plastic pitch fork with fake red devil tail, wearing only black capris and doing some kind of war cry."HAhahaha all the blimeys! What is going on there?!", Mirabelle laughs hysterically joined by Lyca, Ein, and Zwei."Lorrrd that's when this boy discovered that animu stuff he like. His daddy said he was watchin somethin' called Devil king and he started runnin' around screamin' 'HAIL KING DAIMOND!' or somethin' like that.", Junior reminisces fondly"Sigh, it's Daiymo.", Caleb reluctantly corrects as the others look to him, "It was from Demon King Daiymo, they showed it on toonami back then.""Ju look so precious Señor! Like a true agent of chaos!", Camilla spoke adoringly as Caleb groans in embarassment."Child you don't even know! Now look at this! His brother and sister were trying to make dinner for they parents! They made too damn much ramen noodles and Caleb got into the sauce...SOMEHOW THIS HAPPENED. ", Junior stated turning the page to a medium sized photo of Caleb as a toddler with two other kids. His entire body cover in dangling pasta and tomato sauce. The girls burst out laughing save for Drei who nearly chokes on her chips. Caleb looks at them confused."Whaha W-Whahaha What's going on here?! Is he some kind of spaghetti monster or something?!", Zwei chuckles heartily slapping the couch. Caleb covered his face mortified realizing what they were looking at."Hahahah nonono he a 'Spaghetti Baby' that's what my sister called him and his brother and sister.", Junior heartily chuckles, "Man my brother in law was so mad they used all that ramen they were gonna eat all month. He made them put all they could away in the frudge and everyday eat all them noodles up until they was gone! I'm talkin' two weeks, breakfast, lunch, and dinner, spaghetti!""Wait, really?!", Ein stated incredulously."To this day, I can't look at spaghetti without having a Vietnam flashback.", Caleb spoke plainly."Still Dear, look at how happy you and your siblings are here. You all look like you're having so much fun.", Mirabelle says touching the photo.Caleb goes silent for a moment as Camilla, Lyca, and the Zyklons wore varying expressions that Mirabelle even Drei found strange."Yeah, we were.", Caleb replies as she and Junior notices his tone."W-what I mean is, these are still good memories that should be appreciated and cherished. Regardless of present circumstances.", Mirabelle clarifys.Caleb thought for a moment, "You're right. They should be.""Well, I should be goin' on back home now, before it get dark.", Junior says closing the book, standing up with his cane, then rounding the table as Mirabelle and Camilla gave him some room. Caleb stands up to meet him as Junior hands him the book, "You take care of these now.""Always will.", Caleb assures taking the book hugging it securely under his arm as Junior nods to him proudly. Caleb follows his uncle out the door escorting him outside to his car. Before he could get inside the car, Caleb calls him, "Uncle Junior?""Yeah-", before Junior could finish Caleb catches him in a hug to his surprise."Thanks for checking up on me. Sorry for making it hard sometimes", Caleb spoke blinking some tears away.Junior grins hugging back, "Boy, what you talking about? That why I keeping...so it gets a little easier."The two pull away as Junior pats his shoulder before getting in the car and pulling out the driveway. Caleb stands watching him leave oblivious to his homestays and bodyguards watching them from a nearby window. Caleb comes back inside saying he was going to put the album away again before getting some dinner started. Camilla and Ein caught him saying they'd like to cook this time and he agreed. Zwei, Lyca, and Mirabelle straightened up the living room while Drei went next to...quote 'prepare some things.'"You're awfully Ms. Sartana? Anything on your mind?", Ein inquires washing parts of a chicken and battering them up."Que? Nothing in particular.", Camilla says creating a magic seal over a bowl of potatoes. One by one their skin id stripped off in perfect curly loops, "However, if I ever see anyone, new or old, hurt Señor in any way possible, I promise him, her, or it unimaginable pain with no end. I will teach them the meaning of suffering.", Camilla spoke calmly but every word dripping with deadly venom as she removes all the potatoes leaving only the pile of brown peels, "He is mine now. And nothing short of an act of Discord itself will change that. I would like to see anyone dare to try. I do not know why I have begun hunting down those bastardos and puntas (whores) yet.", she finishes creating a red magic seal over the peelings watching as they disintegrate into a small pile of ash then rising them down the sink.Ein looks to her unflinchingly before resuming preparing the chicken, "Well, there's laws, the fact that you have no idea where to start looking, me, obviously, but the more likely reason being the promise you made to him about changing yourself."Camilla glances at her not saying anything but resuming preparing the potatoes."I agree though.", Ein says catching Camilla attention, "Not so much killing needlessly but if anyone comes along with ill-intent toward him...well, I do hope they have very, VERY good health insurance.", ein spoke in a venomous tone.Camilla smirks, "Heh, it's seeing ju bare your fangs.""It's not her fangs they should be worried about. It's everything else attached to them.", Zwei spoke as they turn to see the weasel sitting at the counter with Mirabelle and Lyca beside her, "Sorry, we were listening in but we agree too.", she says as Mirabelle and Lyca nod in agreement with serious looks in their eyes.The all exchange glances collectively coming to a mutual understanding."Oh Mira?", Lyca inquires."Yes Lyca?""I meant to ask, you and Chief came back with a strange scent on you both. Did you and Chief mate on the way back?", Lyca casually asks making Mirabelle tense up and catching the other's attention."Ah, w-well...um...we...did perhaps have a bit of fondling in a secluded spot in the gardens. Then we rode our way back with Dear on my back. So I may be a tad mifty."~Ooooooh kinky~. He rode you all the way home? And right after a little HJ in the hibiscus, tit fuck in the tulips, a Dolly Parton in the rose gard-AH!", Zwei says before getting smacked in the forehead by a silver ladle and falling on the floor."She would've just kept going. It was better for all of us.", Ein says before resuming dinner."I regret nothing!", Zwei stated while on the floor."Well...hehe as Zwei...colourfully put it, we just...really enjoyed our date in the gardens.", Mirabelle assures with a slightly nervous smile.Lyca raises an eyebrow as Camilla gives her a quizzical look knowing there was more she wasn't telling them."Ok, but it's just this scent is different from the mating we usually do w-""Done!", Drei stated cutting off the She-wolf immediately."Oh hey Drei. Where have you been?", Zwei says popping up as the red bump on her head fades away."I was making a few preparations.""What are you prepping for? Waiiit are you trying to prank us or something?", Zwei spoke in a knowing tone as Ein ear twitches slightly."Uhhh no, last time I checked we weren't an American sorority...I think.", Drei quips leaning against the couch, "Anyway I was just storing away the herb, roots, and other plants I collected today. Ms. Marequine?""Y-yes?", The Centaur answers."I trust you enjoyed yourself today.""Oh, I did very much.""Good. Now, go take a shower. I can smell you from here.", she stated plainly.Mirabelle is dealt critical damage to her pride, "He...he...yeah, ok."The Centaur teleports away leaving Lyca puzzled and Camilla skeptical deciding to question her later.A almost an hour passes. Ein and Camilla were finishing up dinner getting everyone's plates ready. Zwei and Lyca decided to pick back up on RDR2. Drei decided to offer some assistance with fixing the plates which Ein accepted. Now she was sitting in a chair looking on her phone scrolling to the video she recorded.Caleb then enters through the hallway dressed in a cleaner pair of pants and a shirt. Drei clicks off the video look at him intently."Man, y'all got it smelling good up in here.", Caleb compliments seeing the spray of food on the counter. Camilla fixed some roasted garlic seasoned potatoes and chicken fajitas while Ein made steamed meat buns(with Camilla magic to cut down on time) and Beijing-style vegetable stir fry. The spicy and robust yet calming and inviting aroma was a unique blend of Mexican and Asian cuisine."Gracias Señor. ~Just wait until ju have taste of what I have prepared~", Camilla spoke a bit more flirtatious than staring with hungry eyes subtly pressing her cleavage together."Thank you sir, happy to see you in a better mood. I'm sure you'll just love my buns. ~They're so warm, round, and soft.~", Ein says finishing in an oddly sensual tone while gently swaying hips. Drei gives them both quizzical looks."Uh hehe, yeah alright. You know, think I'll try both.", Caleb replies with smile pretending not to notice their...odd demeanor. They give slightly surprised looks blushing with lascivious smirks as he turns away."Howdy partners! I'm sheriff Zwei and this is deputy Lyca. Check out our sweet ass white stallion!", Zwei stated in a cowgirl accent."Whoa cool! Is that the White Arabian?! That's the fastest horse in the game. How'd you get it?", Caleb asks both amazed and a bit jealous.Zwei gives him a smirk, "Lyca and I raked up a bunch of cash after coming across a gold mine and helping ourselves.""This game is really fun Chief. You should join us.", Lyca say her cheeks flushed pink with adoring eyes."Believe me, I know. Yeah I think I can play with y'all a bit later.""~Oh, you're gonna play with us? Sounds like fun.~", Zwei blushes winking at him. Drei gives the two of them skeptical look."O...kay then?", Caleb says noticing the weird way she said that then remembering something, "Oh, right! Lyca, I got you this."Caleb pulls out a black choker with a metal, amber crescent moon. Lyca eyes light up in surprise as she examines it."Ohhh, it's beautiful. Is it really for me?!""Yep. Here turn around and don't move.", Caleb requested. Lyca sits down with her back turned as he fastens it around her neck, "Aight, there we go."Lyca stands up touching her neck feeling a sense completeness as if having physical confirmation of where and who she belongs to. Her tail wags furiously behind her as she giggles ecstatically."How does it look Zwei?!""You look awesome. Kinda badass honestly, I'm almost jealous!", Zwei stated her tone both excited and slightly jealous. Ein and Camilla the scene smiling while also feeling a pang in the back of their minds before resuming getting everything ready."I love it Chief!", Lyca stated."It's no problem. I saw it and I thought you might li-MMPH!", was all Caleb could get out before the She-wolf pulls him into a tender kiss standing over the cushions using his shoulders for support. Zwei and the others(save for Drei) give surprised almost longing looks.She separates sitting down with a deep blush and smile on her face tail wagging happily, "Thank you so much, Chief."Caleb blinks collecting his thoughts before smiling back then petting the top of her head, which she loved, "Heh, you're welcome sweety."Lyca then resumes playing with Zwei. At that time, Mirabelle teleports right at the hallway entrance wearing a different outfit from before."Hey, moon pie, enjoy your bath?", Caleb asks"Yes, my Dear, quite refreshing(though I was kinda you would pop in to join me)"Caleb raises an eyebrow, "Whatcha say? I didn't hear ya.""N-Nothing important. Is dinner ready?", she asked changing the subject."I d'know. Might be a few minutes.""Dinner is ready!", Ein stated as Camilla walked by levitating the trays of food behind her into the dining room."Or it's ready right now.", Caleb shrugs.Lyca and Zwei saved their place and proceed into the dining room followed by Mirabelle. Caleb notices Drei still sitting on her phone. He approaches her which she takes notice of."Yo, dinners ready.""I heard.", Drei plainly spoke not looking at him."Ok, oh and...thank you for everything today and...everything before that. I'm glad to have you...as a bodyguard I mean.", Caleb say giving her sweet smile."Y-Yeah, whatever, don't mention it. I'll join you in a minute.", Drei urges hiding her flushed cheeks and avoiding eye contact.Caleb nods heading to the dining room. When he was out of sight, Drei slaps herself hard a few times. She then takes out a vial with little orange balls inside before eating one'Come on, get ahold of yourself you have a mission. Just because they're feeling the effects, doesn't mean you will!', Drei berated herself looking back at her phone. On it, an article about tonight supposed to be a full moon out and host families are to be prepared. Luckily, the Karmaitachi was prepared...buuut in a very different way.Drei then takes out five more vials her gaze lingering on the clear liquid labeled with Caleb's name."Glad to have me huh?", Drei repeated his words, "Well let's test that sentiment."WRSup Fam!

    Chapter 39: Mad RomanceNote: Hey here's a fun drinking game: take a shot every time you read the word 'pleasure' in a sentence. Also, when I say 'shots' I don't necessarily mean alcohol, lookin' at all you teenagers on here, be responsible....Caleb and the girls enjoyed a pleasant dinner together. They shared some stories, told some jokes, and teased Caleb some more about his baby pictures; the latter Caleb was the least enthused about but chose to endure the embarassment. Throughout dinner, Camilla, Mirabelle, and Lyca would casually flirt with or make suggestive gestures towards him( sensually licking a spoon, playfully touching his arm or thigh) which he didn't find awkward even appreciated the attention. What he DID find awkward was catching Ein and Zwei giving him some flirty look or spouting a line that made him raise an eyebrow. It was weird but he figured they just wanted to mess with him too and didn't really mean anything; they did see his 8th grade school photo afterall. Thanks Junior. Drei, suprisingly, appeared to be the only one NOT messing with him. In fact, she was uncharacteristically silent throughout dinner.After dinner, Caleb wanted to take Zwei up on her offer and play a little RDR2 before bed but she turned him down saying she was incredibly tired. Not just her, Ein as well. They decided to leave to turn in for the night. Caleb was then approached by Drei who gave him a vial of odd clear liquid whispering about his dirty deed with Mirabelle. He decided not to ask questions and do as instructed. After arming the security system for the night, Caleb wanted to clean up before turning in a little tonight but Mirabelle, Lyca, and Camilla stepped in saying they would do so. Of course, he insisted not wanting to put the work all on them but they insisted even harder wanting him to rest. Knowing it was pointless to argue he relented, took a hot shower, and then went on to bed. Or at least tried to.'Haaaaa, damn I'm tired.', Caleb thought to himself lying in bed staring up at the pitch black ceiling arms behind his head. He wore a fresh blue Adidas v-neck t-shirt and grey sweatpants. He couldn't fall asleep. His was reflecting on everything; his past, his family, the girls, but one thing that lingered on his mind the most...the fact that he wasn't going to die a virgin now. He almost believe his first was with someone as stunning as Moon pie; then again HE was also her first so...guess it evens out? On the other hand, he knew if they are EVER found by Sterling or ICEP in general, it would be the end. Everything he's built with the girl, gone! Oh, then there's no telling how Lyca and Camilla would react when they find he had intercourse with Mirabelle! Would they be jealous?! Angry?! Both?! All of THIS because of his lack of restraint! His carelessness! His-'STOP! It's fine! ...It's fine. Everything...will be fine. As long as we don't give them a reason to suspect anything, we'll be fine. And I don't have to worry about Camilla and Lyca. I'll just have to tell them, sooner rather than later and hopefully they'll understand. What they'll do afterwards...I'll just have to deal with...somehow. Plus, Moon pie said she wasn't ovulating right now so it's not like she'll get pregnant right? Right?'Caleb turns over on his side ruminating on his thoughts when he noticed the vial of clear liquid Drei gave him that he forgot to use."Shit, forgot about that.", he cursed quickly raising up then grabbing the vial. He notices a small folded up paper attached to the bottom. He turns on the the light and reads it then raises an eyebrow, "I gotta do what? The whole damn...psshhhh fine."Caleb proceeds to rub the entire content of clear, tangy smelling viscous fluid all over his genitals. After a second it starts to burn a little to his discomfort before gradually dying down."Alright, that done. The hell this stuff supposed to do anyway?", he said look at the now empty vial then putting it on the nightstand. He looks at his phone, "Damn. 11 already? I really need to go to slee-"BA-THUMPCaleb is cut off upon feeling his heart pounding and tingling sensation spread throughout his body. The mark on his chest starts to faintly glow, his loins feel hot, and he's suddenly INCREDIBLY thirsty."Haaa dammit Drei, what the hell was in that? Zoom", Caleb stated to himself clenching his throat before teleporting to the kitchen. He fixes a cup of water and downs the whole thing, "Gah hah hahhh, damn. Am I sick or somethin'? I'm feeling kinda light headed now. Might have some Tylenol in my drawer."Caleb teleports back into his room with another cup of water for the pain meds but was surprised by what he found."Ah! There you are Dear!", Mirabelle stated in a very singsongy tone."Gah!", Caleb flinches startled spilling a little water on the floor, "Moon pie?""Oh, sorry! Did I startle you?"Caleb sighs putting the cup on the nightstand, "A little. What is it? Something wrong?""I suppose you could say that.", Mirabelle coyly spoke quickly closing the distance as she places her hands on his shoulders staring at him with hunger and adoration, "NOT embracing you with all my love and body certainly feels wrong.~", She spoke seductively as a purple mist swirls from het tail around her legs and quickly spreading around the floor.Caleb is taken aback finally noticing her risque attire of a light purple tranluscent covering her top and lower half, a dark purple lace bra that barely contained her ample Double Ds, and purple lace Centaurean panties on her front lower region and nothing on the back. Her entire being seemed to radiate ethereal beauty and inviting warmth and scent was intoxicating like sweet grape wine. He could feel his loins growing tighter and hotter as she inches closer with plump parted lips and half lidded eyes.'Wow, I don't what it is but Moon pie is ESPECIALLY sexy right now. I just wanna pin her ass against the wall and-HOLD UP HOLD UP WHAT?!', Caleb shakes his head clearing his thoughts then noticing Centaur softly moan with her eyes shut and cheeks flushed. He realizes he had been groping her right breast and fondling her lowerlips through her panties the whole time. He withdraws quickly pulling away accidentally knocking to cup of water to the floor as he circles around her."~Haaa you're certainly randy tonight my Dear. So am I~.", she spoke in a sultry tone her purple aura shimmering around her body and purple mist swirling more around the room as she stared at with pure desire.Caleb eyes shot wide as this whole scenario was very familiar to him. He quickly teleports to his bed and quickly draws up the blinds. Immediate dread shot through his nerve upon seeing a full moon hanging in the sky tonight."Aww shit, he we go again.", Caleb uttered."~Indeed! I'm excited to go again as well and recieve another helping of your delicious spirit energy.", Mirabelle spoke inching her upper body to the bed lifting up her veil showing her soaking wet back pussy, "And I promise...I'll give you so many wonderful babies!""What?!", Caleb exclaims."M-My body may not be ready right now but my soul, heart, and mind are more than willing to recieve you! Together I bet we can make little miracles happen! Oh I'm so excited! I bet they'll look JUST like me but have combinations of our hair colors and skin tones. Hehehe I bet they'll love Dr. Pepper just like you and we can all bond over anime. I wonder who their favorite Sailor scouts will be. Oooooh just imagining those tiny little hooves in my lap as I read to them.", Mirabelle squeals happily hugging her sides and Caleb recoils away.'What the fuck is wrong with this girl?! She realizes what'll happen if ICEP finds out I got he pregnant right?! Goddamn full moon!", Caleb curses at the moon. Then again, another growing part of THRILLED at the idea of making offspring with this gorgeous woman in front of him. He wanted take her right now and pump her full of his seed-SMACK. Caleb mentally slaps himself, 'Christ! What the fuck is wrong with ME?!'He could feel her fingers hook the hem of his sweatpants trying to pull them off as she mushes her breasts to his stomach. He refocuses and teleports from under her to her surprise as she now finds him behind her wondering what he has in mind."Moon pie, that all sounds good and all but I ain't ready for none of that yet and neither are you!", Caleb stated trying not to make eye contact."Oh bullocks! We would make a great mummy and daddy! '~Why don't we practice a bit by playing a little house...daddy.~", Mirabelle spoke seductively her purple eyes glowing brightly. Caleb could feel warmth pulsating throughout his body her voice music to his ears and he feels his will to resist starting to waver. He had to get out of there now.Caleb throws open the door and dips out, "Sorry baby, I just can- OOMPH!", he elicits suddenly having his vision oscured along with the sensation of warm softness enveloping his face."AHH! ~Señor~", Came the voice of Camilla. Caleb looks up at her flushed cheeks and lust-filled gaze realizing his head was between her mountainous flesh orbs. He had accidentally pushed her up against the wall with his hand on her thigh the other cupping under her breast, "~Huhu I did not expect ju to be so aggressive tonight. I had a few charm spells prepared and everything but I suppose this work too.~""C-Camilla?!", Caleb stuttered quickly pulling away. His eyes widen seeing her sexy attire of brown thigh length tights with brown gauters connecting her black lace panties, black lace bra that showed an eyefull of caramel-colored I-Cup cleavage and black veil stopping at her midriff. Caleb gulps staring at her luscious curves, the sweet plump lips, beautiful ruby red eyes all inviting him take her into his arms, push her up against the wall and-'AGH! STOP!', Caleb mentally screams shaking the voice out his mind as Camilla smiles devilishly at."Huhuhuhu do ju like what ju see Señor?", Camilla flirts sensually running her hands along her body as her wings partially spread out and tail swayed about. Caleb tensed up his words caught in his throat that was until he felt another pair of soft flesh mush in his back and arms locking under his. He turns to Mirabelle as she rests her chin to his shoulder."Camillaaaa! I was going to have him first.", Mirabelle whines mushing her breast harder to his back to Caleb's surprise."Sorry Señora. I just could not wait to have a taste of him for myself.", Camilla cheekily replies mushing her breasts into his chest adding to Caleb's stress. The primal voice in his mind screaming and nagging for release and his heart pounds wildly. He then notices Camilla grip his shoulders inching closer with parted lips. Feeling a strong desire to escape, he instinctively teleports out of their grasp much to their surprise. He lands a few feet down the hall taking a knee as he takes a few deep breath. Unable to stop her motions, Camilla and Mirabelle breasts mush together and Camilla plants a kiss right on Mirabelle's lips their eyes widening in surprise at the strange sensation.Caleb turns back around shocked by the sight of the girl-on-girl makeout session. They quickly part staring at each other with a saliva strand connecting them before they turn to Caleb noticing the tent he was now pitching. They smile deviously at him finding a new weakness to exploit as Caleb quickly tucks himself away down there and makes a run for the living room. As soon as he enters the living room, he's intercepted and tackled into a hug."Oww! What the fu-ohhh no.", Caleb utters knowing the second he saw a pair of fluffy canine ears nuzzling his chest who it was.Lyca, sits herself up straddling his waist, looking down at him with adoring eye and smile her tail wagging happily. He could make out that she wore ONLY a black pair of brief panties with her firm A-cups, sexy firm abs, and hard pink nipples. She happily yips grinning lasciviously as she grinds her plump, firm butt against his bulge. Caleb grabs her firm thighs squeezing them feeling the urge to bend this sexy doggy over and-"Rrahh!", Caleb elicits teleporting from under the She-wolf to her surprise. He appears a few feet behind her. His body starts aching and ripples of purples energy pulsates throughout every nerve. He was VERY thirsty and... aroused. He turns to see the girls closing in on him afraid things will end up like last time where they almost hurt each other over him."Dear, is everything ok?", Mirabelle asks in concern which caught Caleb off guard as he sees them staring at him. Caleb quickly stands to his feet."Girls stop! You don't have to do this! You don't have to hurt each other!", Caleb stated using the momentary glimpse of clarity."Why would we do that, Chief?", Lyca ask innocently.Caleb gives a surprised look, "Lyca y-you can talk?""Of course I can silly!", Lyca stated emphatically tail wagging happily looking at him with wanting eyes."We're more than willing to share Señor! We ARE a familia after all.", Camilla spoke in a husky tone biting her lip hungrily."We love you Dear! And each other! We agreed won't fight and love you with all our hearts!", Mirabelle croons with heart filled eyes.Caleb looks at them confused that they haven't all jumped on him yet. Their eyes and faces radiated unbridled lust and desire yet their demeanor seemed as though they were consciously hold themselves back. As if waiting for something."Someone's confused *munch*", Came the voice of Drei. Caleb whips his heads seeing the wind weasel sitting atop the counter liesurely eating a can of Pringles."YOU!", Caleb stated pointing a her.Drei pauses looking at her phone then responds plainly, "Me!""What the hell is happening?! Why are you here?! Where are you're sisters?! How are the girls not affected by the moon?! What did you do?!", Caleb demanded answers as Drei nibbles on the chip unfazed by his ranting."Well, to put in plainly, I'm help you guys get your rocks off.", Drei responds flashing him an odd look.Caleb is confused, "...What?""Dear?", Mirabelle spoke getting his attention, "Lyca and Camilla know we...made love together. Ms. Drei told them...er or rather showed them."Caleb gives a shocked look turn to Drei who points the phone screen at him with the video of him and Mirabelle playing at full volume."You were recording us?! What the fuck?!"" Oh please, this country NSA does way worse than this everyday. Besides, I've seen tiktok videos. This is family friendly content by comparison.", Drei turns off the video putting the phone on the counter."We are not upset Señor. In fact, we were not even surprised.", Camilla happily admits he body lightly trembling."We kinda figured Mira would be the first one to take your first time. Besides, either way you're STILL going to be MY first Chief!", Lyca stated blushing heavily her breath becoming heavier."Wait...you're...", Caleb uttered flabbergasted."Look, they had to know. Do you really think it's fair? You voluntarily chose to give yourself completely to someone you're in love with, despite the risks and dangers, but you can't do the same for the others you share the same feelings for? Stop getting in the way of your own progress!", Drei questioned sounding slightly annoyed.Caleb is taken aback then looks to the girls as the appeared to be trembling and breathing heavily while staring lovingly at him, "The moon. How...are they not affected.""Don't be ridiculous. You clearly see that they ARE affected...just not in the way you experienced.", Drei answered before munching on a chip."But last time they were-""LAST TIME...they didn't know how you really felt about them. When liminals develop romantic feelings for someone and they don't fully express their feelings to them, they go full-on rape face during a full moon because of their subconscious fears, uncertainty, and desires they have towards the person in question. It's like a drastic response to validate our emotions without being held back by fear of rejection. Most of the time we overcompensate and...accidents happen. It's even worse if it's more than one liminal.", Drei says the last part while glancing away pensively before clearing her throat, "However, in rare cases like this, YOUR homestays have no uncertainties. You've already validated their emotions through your actions and behavior. They have no reason to fight each other since there is no doubt in their minds that you love them all equally and they agree they each love you back."Caleb listens to the wind weasel before feeling a pair of arms lock around his on either side. He looks to Mirabelle on his left, Lyca on the right, then Camilla approaching in front of him gently cupping his face. All three staring with colored hearts in their eyes.Girl-scopeThe each saw Caleb with the sweetest smile, beautiful chocolate brown eyes, handsome face, and adorable laugh. Each of them playing the memory of the moment they completely fell in love with him. For Mirabelle, the first time he said he loved her even after how she acted on the full moon. For Lyca, when she found out he gave up part of his life to save her's after the Hellhound attack. For Camilla, when he found out about her past and what a vicious killer she is, he STILL accepted her and loved her.Caleb around at these beautiful women before him. A warmth pulsates throughout his body, "Wow...this is quite the change.""They're not the only ones.", Drei says holding up a mirror she...pulls seemingly out of nowhere.Caleb moves his arms out of the girls grasp moving in closer. He was shocked at his reflection seeing his irises glowing bright purple then pulls down his shirt seeing the mark on his chest glowing brightly and sending pulses of purple aura rippling throughout his body seeing it flowing in his arms to his fingertips."It looks like THEY aren't the only ones affected by the moon anymore. Kind of a guess but have you been feeling hot all over, aches in the lower stomach, maybe short of breath?", Drei inquired crossing her legs."Yeah! Thirsty as hell too. I drank some water but that didn't help.""It's not water your thirsty for.", Drei quips glancing to the girls as they approached Caleb. He could see the insatiable hunger in their eyes that was both unnerving...and very enticing, "Stop thinking so much and just let go. Don't fight the urges you have, embrace them to the fullest. Do like American rapper Eminem and just loose yourself in the moment."Caleb gives an incredulous look, "What the fu...have you lost yo-""If you're worried about any 'accidental conceptions', I have to ask. You DID use the vial I gave you right? All of it? On your genitals?", Drei asks."Wha-y-yeah, why? What was that stuff anyway?! It burned like hell.", Caleb stated."It was just a very potent and effective spermicide my birth mother invented. If you wanna do it raw, go ahead, every shot would be a blank; like a gun that shoots red flags with 'BANG' on them.", Drei explained, "Also, don't worry about my sisters. I slipped enough sedative in their food to keep them alseep all night and applied my Anti-Full Moon concoction on both of them and myself. Security is taken care of I set a few surprises around the perimeter. Go ahead, enjoy yourselves."Before Caleb could say something, the seize him much to his surprise."You hear that Dear?! We can go ALL OUT tonight! I'm sorry but I can't wait any longer! I need you now!", Mirabelle spoke the last of her rationality melting away mushing her breasts to his back making him tense up."~Chief I really, really REALLY wanna mate with you right now.~", Lyca says huskily pressing herself against his side her hardened nipples against his arm."~It is not nice to keep your lovers in heat waiting Señor.~, Camilla whispers into his ear nibbling his earlobe making him shudder. She then kisses a pink magic seal on Caleb cheek. Immediately his body becomes extremely light and taking away any physical strength, "~Now, let us take this to your room Señor huhuhuhu~, Camilla snickers devilishly dragging him along by his shirt with Mirabelle and Lyca excitedly following while he struggles in vain."My room?! Hold up now! All four of us can't fit in there!", Caleb stated."~No worries Dear. We'll be veeeery close soon.", Mirabelle hummed lustfully."Drei come on! Back me up here!", Caleb pleaded to the Wind Weasel who had earbuds in her ears bopping her head to Eminem's 'Godzilla' she got from Caleb playlist."What was that? You need some lube?", Drei spoke removing an earbud before tossing a bottle of herbal oil which Lyca caught and thanked her for. Caleb curses at her down the hall before the door to his room audibly closes. Drei stops the video a moment, "And now we see if you can handle three at once. Don't worry, you won't get hurt...much...probably."Drei says restarting the video bopping her head again enjoying Caleb's taste in music.~Deluxe Lemons~...In Caleb's room..."H-hey-AHMM MMPH!", Caleb tries to utter but is cut off when Camilla captures his lips to hers aggressively and greedily frenching him while hold the back of his head and mushing her breasts to his chest.Behind him, Mirabelle mushes her breasts to his back running her hand along the inside of his shirt feeling his muscles and tummy while kissing and sucking the crook of his neck.Lyca proceeds to pull down his jogging pants smiling lewdly at the huge bulge protruding in his boxers. She pulls the open apart setting his hardened manhood free from it's prison. The masculine scent hitting hers, along with Camilla and Mirabelle's, nostrils signalling he was ready for sex. The She-wolf begins stroking him with her soft padded paws occasionally licking his head.Caleb moans into Camilla's mouth and shudders at all this stimulation feeling like he could burst at any moment. He barely even resisted when Camilla and Mirabelle pulled his shirt off tossing it to the side leaving him only in his boxers. Camilla could feel his cock quiver against her thigh and pops off Caleb letting him catch his breath."Señora Lyca wait!", Camilla said catching Lyca and Mirabelle attention, "We can't have him cum so soon. He needs to enjoy all of us. Right?", Camilla flashes a knowing smirk to Mirabelle who smirk back."~Right.~", Mirabelle agreed."Haa h-hey whatch'all-*zoom*", before Caleb could finish Mirabelle teleports all three of them closer to the bed where they push him on his back, "Hey list-aaahhhhhoooo.", he moans feeling both girls harassing his manhood. One stroking his shaft and tip with her dainty fingers the other careessing his ballsack gingerly playing with them. The Nightmare and Devil leaning over staring down at him smiling like hungry predators. They then proceed to undo their bras allowing their bare tits to dangle freely in front of him. Caleb jaws drops seeing the cream colored Double D red peaks to the left and caramel colored I-cup dark pink peaks to the right."Can we see that Lyca?", Mirabelle requests before Lyca hands them the bottle of lube which they proceed to lather up their breasts. Caleb watches stunned almost salivating seeing his girlfriends as sensually covering their bare tits in oil right in front of him. They take their positions on either side right over his towering cock as Caleb realizes what they were doing."Hehehe about a little comparison test Dear?", Mirabelle cheekily spoke before she and Camilla pressed their thick breasts together sandwiching Caleb's cock between their round, oily flesh prisons. Mirabelle's nipples clashed with Camilla's as the two liminals pleasure their lover with a double boob job."HAAANnnghh! Ohooo", Caleb groans throwing his head back as the girls chuckle at his reaction."~Huhuhuhu so Señor? Who's breasts would ju say feel the best?", Camilla teases with heated breath."Whahaaa...what kinda ahhhh question is that?!", Caleb stated clenching his teeth sucking in air stifling his moans."~A simple one. Who's knockers feel the most pleasant? We promise neither of us will be mad.~", Mirabelle says slightly salivating and moaning before she and Camilla increase the pressure a bit. The lewd sound of their wet slapping flesh against Caleb's members arousing them and Caleb even more. Unbeknownst to any of them, the door to the room creaked open and a phone camera peaked in. Drei could be seen observing the group through the video feed with a blank expression."NNNgghah fine! Both! I love'em both! Your tits are amazing! It ain't right to choose one over the other.", Caleb stated his mind being overcome with lust even thrusting his hips a bit to the girls surprise."~Hahaha, we figured you'd say that. It's just the way you are after all.~", Mirabelle says a wide grin forming, "~But it looks like we found something else you like~", she finished look to Camilla who smirks at Camilla who smirks understandingly. They make sure Caleb was looking before the two start making our with each other growing more aroused at their nipples scraping together.Caleb look down panting mouth agape at the sexy show they were putting on for him. They look right at him with lustful, come hither eyes while kissing. His arousal reaches a new level ecstacy. Lyca pants fondling her womanhood and breast watching them. She then impatiently pulls off her panties and positions herself over Caleb's face."~Haaa Chief I can't wait anymore! I wanna feel good TOO!", Lyca pleaded with heated breath with pulsating hot womanhood right over him dripping juices onto his collar bone. The silver moon pendant twinlking slightly in the light from the window. Before he could reply, she sits right on his face shaking her hips urging him to taste her. Camilla and Mirabelle ceases making out before swirling tongues around Caleb's head coating it in hot saliva and enjoying his delicious precum.Caleb feels every semblance of rational slowly eroding away. He repeatedly told himself this was wrong and reminding himself of the consequences. He was losing the tug of war in his mind and felt like screaming until he remembered Drei's words. 'Don't fight the urges, embrace them to the fullest. Loose yourself! LOOSE YOURSELF!'He relaxes taking in every sensation, stimulation, and reverberation of pleasure fully giving himself over to his desire. The desire...to FUCK THESE BEAUTIFUL WOMEN WITH EVERYTHING HE HAD.Caleb eye's shot widen glowing bright purple as rippling purple aura envelops his body and spreading over the girls as well. They go into a daze feeling a surge of ecstacy throughout their bodies making them tremble. He feels a sudden surge of adrenaline course through his body. Caleb firmly grasps Lyca's plump butt cheeks to her surprise then plunges his tongue into her hot crevice devouring her wholeheartedly. He starts bucking his hips wildly between Camilla and Mirabelle breasts to their surprise.Lyca arches her back placing her palms to the wall for support as he squeezes and fondles her butt. His hot wet muscles greedly scraping her quivering walls, "HAHHH! That's it Chief! Eat me up! AHhhhahh!""HAaaa what's gotten into you Dear?", Mirabelle stated with a smile honestly delighted my his sudden vigor."~Someone is suddenly full of energy, we'll need to up the pressure Señora.~", Camilla stated undulating her tits along with Mirabelle. The two quickly getting a rhythm going as Lyca pants and moans erratically her tail wagging energetically as she feels her first orgasm coming. The She-wolf throws her head back, tongue hanging out, feeling his teeth brush against her clitoris."~Caleb! CALEEEB HANNGHHOOOOO!", Lyca howls loudly her orgasm hitting and dowsing Caleb in her love as Caleb loses control coating Mirabelle and Camilla breasts and under their chins in his cum. Lyca slumps against the wall catching her breath as Caleb licks up her sweet juices. Camilla and Mirabelle parted in lustful daze smiling sexily. The two proceed to lick up his cum from their breasts. The second they taste it, their eyes and bodies glow with purple and red aura and they fall into a short daze before hungrily devouring the rest to the last drop. The two trembles in delight as their aura begins to fade."Your spirit energy is as delicious as ever Señor!", Camilla chirps swooning from side to side as Mirabelle utters an unintelligible sigh still coming down from cloud 9.Caleb wordlessly moves Lyca off of him and raises pulling his knees to his chest much to the girls confusion."Dear? Is everything al-", Mirabelle got out before Caleb suddenly teleports away appearing behind her and Camilla. His body in partial darkness save for the ripling purple aura around his body and imposing purple eyes and glowing mark stood, "D-Dear- MMPH!"Caleb silences her plunging into a passionate which she quickly sinks into while he gropes her breast over her shoulder. He pops off her leaving her stunned wanting more before turning to Camilla and plunging into her lips passionately frenching and groping her with his other hand the separating leaving her panting her air. Lyca watches starting to feel left out."~Dear~", "~Señor~""Alright, I let y'all have your way. Now...it's my turn.", Caleb stated his voice growing deeper which sent a shiver down the girls spines. He turns his piercing purple gaze toward Lyca, "Lyca...you're first."She blushes red and excited grin forming on her face. Drei raises an eyebrow seeing things were getting interesting.The group take their positions. Lyca lying on back with Caleb standing over her now completely naked and Mirabelle and Camilla and his right and left respectively presenting their bare rears as they leaned on the bed. Lyca stares up at her Chief imposing figure and his rock hard manhood stood erect before her. Caleb caresses the Mirabelle and Camilla rears making them gasps in surprise before removing his hands and leaning to meet Lyca eye-to-eye. Lyca gulps nervously staring back at him."You sure you want this? We can stop right here.", Caleb whispers wanting her permission.Lyca kisses his lips giving him a solemn look, "No Chief, I want this! Please, make me yours!"He caresses the side of her face as warm pulses of purple aura relax her senses giving her a feel of complete trust in him. He lines himself up to her entrance while Mirabelle and Camilla watch. Lyca tenses and shudders feeling his head push it's way through her lips. Caleb continues feeling her soaking wet tight quivering walls before hitting some blockage. With a quick thrust, he breaks past her hymen burying himself almost to the hilt making the She-wolf arch her back eliciting a shrill moan as Camilla and Mirabelle hold her hands supportively. Caleb gingerly wipes away tear from her cheek making her smile at him before urging him to continue. He begins thrusting his hips as the pain the She-wolf felt quickly melted away now only feeling extreme pleasure. He eventually gets medium-slow rhythm going."~Haaa Chief! This feels amazing! Faster! Pound me harder! Please!"~", Lyca moans loudly gripping the sheet while her tail wags erratically. She wraps her legs around her waist wanting him to go deeper. He eagerly complies quickening his pace as Lyca practically bursts at the seems throwing head back in pure bliss and disbelief at what she's been missing.Caleb notices Mirabelle and Camilla looking at her with longing and slight envy and decides not to leave them out. He uses his free hands to stroke the other two girls pussie making them shreik in surprise before he shoves two fingers in for each of them."AHHNN Señor!", "DearAahaaa!", they elicit simultaneously.Soon Caleb found his rhythm thrusting the sexy Werewolf's tight, wet pussy and vigorously fingering the other two churning their honey pots and driving them mad. Their moans of pleasure and lewd fleshy, wet sex noises were music Caleb's ears and spurred on his lust for them."~Ohhaa Tus dedos son como pura magia mi amor(Your fingers are like pure magic my love) HAAA!~", Camilla expresses digging her claws into covers."~Don't stop Dear! Stir up my phany like crazy! Mold my insides like clay AHaaaa!", Mirabelle shouted in delerium smiling lewdly drooling slightly."You feel amazing Lyca! You're squeezing me all over! You must've been hungry huh ahhhh?", Caleb grunts thrusting harder into her."~Yeah. I'm your Big Bad Wolf and I'm gonna eat you up!", Lyca stated in delighted at getting to talk dirty on her own. Mirabelle and Camilla breathing grows more erratic and the moan grow louder as his wonderful fingers scrape and toy with their insides."~NNNAHH. Chief I'm so close. Make me cum! I wanna come with your dick!", Lyca stated equally delrius her face contorted in pleasure gyrating her hips to feel him scrape her insides more."Fuck yeah! No problem nnngh! I'm about close myself!", Caleb stated thrusting and fingering more vigorously."~Cum inside me Chief! INSIIIIDE! I LOVE YOU! Gimme your puppiiiies!", Lyca howls loudly to the ceiling.Caleb reaches his limit a fires his load right into Lyca's womb making her scream in ecstasy before arching her back feeling her intense orgasm sweep over her. A second later, Mirabelle and Camilla screaming in delight having their orgasms overtake them and coating Caleb's hands in love nectar. The entire room reverberates the sound of pure pleasure so intense in could anyone who heard it spine tingle.Drei feels her spine tingle still watching them through her phone.'Wow, he's actually doing better than I thought.', Drei thought to herself.Caleb pulls himself out of her as the mixture of their orgasms leak from the She-wolf entrance onto the sheet. Lyca lay on her back trying to catch her breath and trembling in delight still feeling his hot seed inside of her. Mirabelle and Camilla lay next to her panting as well in satisfaction."~T-That...was the best thing haaaa. I mated...I mated with my Alpha.~", Lyca uttered in proud delerium and satisfaction feeling like she was walking on air.Caleb smiles to himself at the delighted expressions of his mates. To his surprise was barely even tired. In fact, he was more excited and even more aroused and ready to pump the next woman to the brim with his seed. But which one?Suddenly, Camilla shoots and grabs him by the shoulders breathing heavily as her naked body glistens with sweat."~Oh Señor! I can't wait anymore!~", The she Devil stated before plunging into a passionate make session which eagerly got in to. Guess he got his answer. She mushes her breasts to his firm chest and hooks her plump thighs around his leg while her tail coils around his waist. He could feel her soaking wet entrance grinding against his member as she impatiently thrusts her hips making her plumb rear and butt jiggle with every subtle movement. Caleb grabs these thicc latina hips for support as he lines himself up with her awaiting lips. With no resistance and because of her previous orgasm, her easily slips himself inside of her burying himself to the hilt making her gasp in surprise and delight. He clenches his with a growl at the vibrating flesh and intense heat that made his dick practically melt. Not waiting, Camilla starts undulating her hips excitedly thrust his cock inside herself as juices leaks onto the floor and their flesh to vibrate every time their hips collided."HHHHAA IT'S IN! A-AND WE FIT TOGETHER PERFECTLY! Ju ARE mi Destino! We were truly made for each other! Ahh AYY Ayyy!", Camilla stated emphatically her heart-filled red eyes, wide lewd smile, and forked tongue hanging out as she vigorously humped him. Mirabelle watches breathing heavily beginning to fondle her front pussy and right breast oblivious to the figure creeping up to her side. He plobs down on her back almost making her buck instinctively before a pair of furry arm and clawed canine-like hands snake behind her beginning to grope her breasts. She turns to see Lyca giving a toothy grin over her shoulder."L-Lyca?! Nng W-W-What are you doing?!", Mirabelle stated blushing in surprise trembling at the sensation of fur convered fingers kneeding her flesh."Can't let those two have all the fun now, can we? ~Besides, that stuff you and Cami did earlier looked fun. I wanna try it too.~", Lyca stated increasing the pressure of her groping and squeezing before planting a kiss to Mirabelle lips.Mirabelle eyes widen in surprise before gradually relaxing and quickly getting into. She shoves her fingers into her front pussy while making out with the She-wolf fonding her boobs like no tomorrow.On the other side of the room, Camilla was still riding Caleb with the latter having trouble matching her pace between thrusts even worse being overwhelmed by her hot, wet velvety flesh devouring his cock bringing him close to blowing his load.Camilla smiles enjoying his pleasure filled expression, "~How do I feel Mi Amor Aahhh?! Ju like dis older pussy don't ju!? Ayyy G-Go on, cum! Cum all ju want!"Caleb clenches teeth as his eyes flash purple and his aura flares. He grabs underneath her thighs to her surprise, "No, not before you!"Camilla yelps in surprise as he picks her up and lays on her back on the bed. He crawls over her trapping her underneath him as her eyes widen as images of the cartel men flash in her mind. Caleb cup her face but she pulls away to his surprise."N-no! No nonono!", Camilla shaking her head with tears forming in her clenched eyes. Lyca and Mirabelle look to them curiously ceasing their fun as Caleb quickly realizes what was wrong."Ssshhh, Camilla, it's ok. You're safe now.", Caleb whispers to her brushing her hair as she looks up at him with quivering eye seeing his kind eyes and warm smile. He kisses her tears away sending pulses of warming purple aura that calms her mind and body, "I love you and I want to give you everything you deserve."Camilla expression softens and a small frown grows, "I...I really wish ju could have been mi first Señor."Caleb kisses her lips look her right in the eye, "I may not be your first, but I'll DAMN sure be your last."Camilla blushes heavily in surprise before he seizes her lips in passionate kiss which she quickly melts into wrapping her arms around his neck. Mirabelle and Lyca smile at them before resuming to their own make out session.Drei looks on at the scene with a small smirk and faint blush in her cheeks.Camilla spreads her legs wantingly which Caleb senses. He lines himself up then shoves himself back inside her hot , moist womanhood making her arch her back. He starts thrusting her making her moans grow louder and her mountainous breasts to flop and jiggle about. Camilla wraps her legs around his waist. Caleb grabs one of her gorgeous tits and begins massaging and squeezing then then taking the other in his mouth swirling her tongue around erect nipple."~Ay AYYY! ¡Si! ¡Lámeme más! ¡Márcame como tuyo! ¡Haz que mi cuerpo se vuelva adicto a tu tacto! ¡Por favor!(Yes! Lick me more! Mark me as yours! Make my body addicted to you touch! Please!)~", Camilla moans loudly in absolute bliss as he pumps in and out of her."Haaa, I'll just assume that means 'I love you'!", Caleb grunted with a smirk. He then sits her up climbing up on his knees pushing her back to the wall still thrusting as she moves her hips in synch with his. She spreads her large black wings outwards and closes them around herself and Caleb giving them their own little space.Meanwhile, Mirabelle and Lyca separate leaving a strand of saliva as they breath heavily with Mirabelle fingering herself and her free hand fondling Lyca's slit from behind. Lyca continued grope her breast then attacks the Centaur neck in playful nibbles."~Haaa...Senor! SEÑOR! I cannot hold on! I have to cum!~", Camilla spoke her voice ragged as she tightened her grip around his waist, "~Please shoot all your love inside of me! Plant your seed with my womb! I WANT IT! GIVE IT TO ME!" , she shouted in her demonic yet oddly arousing voice."Alright! Here it comes! HHMNNMGHH!""HHAAAAHHHH!", Camilla screams out as her orgasm hits feeling Caleb hot load filling up her womb bulging out her stomach a bit."Haaannngh!", "MMnnnnghh", Lyca and Mirabelle elicited simultaneously as they came from each other's fondling.Caleb catches his breath a moment before noticing Camilla's body radiating red aura that seemed mix with his aura. He then sees the same strange...ovaries-shaped red symbol from last time appears again on her lower stomach as Camilla trembles feverishly in a type of trance. Her aura symbol stops glowing leaving behind a black tattoo-like ovary symbol on her lower tummy."I am...complete.", Camilla utters in satisfaction and delight touching the spot with the tattoo staring lovingly at Caleb"I figured already you were. There's nothin' half-hearted about you.", Caleb cheekily smirks pettting her head brushing her horns."What ju said earlier, about being mi last? Thanks to this, ju will.", she says tracing a claw around the tattoo, "I do not know how, but I sense that I cannot and WILL NOT recieve ANYONE else but ju, Señor.", she spoke trembling in delirium spreading her wings.Caleb was slightly confused but accepts kissing her lips, "Just as it should be."She smiles her body going limp before Caleb lays her on the bed; not even caring that her wing knocked down everything including the lamp on his nightstand. Caleb pulls himself inch by inch out of her slit. She instinctively closes her thighs to prevent any of his seed from leaking out. Caleb gives a look of satisfaction still feeling full of energy as his aura surges around his body and eyes radiated wispy purple flamesHe then feels a familiar pair of sexy around his neck and large breasts mush into his chest. He turns with a smirk see Mirabelle. Her body surging with purple aura, eyes glowing brightly like purple stars, purple mist spreading over the floor, and a snarky grin on her face."~Don't forget about me, Dear~", she emphasizes the last part grabbing and squeezing his ass cheek hard making him flinch.He cups her chin, "Believe me, I can't."The two instantly teleport to the other side of the room, Caleb momentarily realizing just how BIG his room is, as they take their positions. Mirabelle's upper body laying against the table with Caleb behind her. He caresses and gropes horsey rear which she tantalizingly wiggles in front of him. Caleb lifts up her tail biting his lip as the sight of her purple fur and womanhood glistening with an enticing sweet scent filling his senses. He teasingly strokes her slippery folds making her tremble in anticipation."~Haaa c-come on Dear! I'm done with the warm-ups! Fuck me already!", Mirabelle whines wiggling her rear impatiently looking back with puffed out cheeks and adorable scowl. Caleb smiles then notices her other entrance pulsating impatiently then smirks a mischievous purple gleam in his eyes. He stealthily grabs to bottle of lube, conveniently on the floor next to him, and covers is hard member in a generous amount."Alright Moon pie not gonna keep ya waiting. Gotta ask, how you feel about anal?", Caleb devilishly inquires lining himself up touch the tip to her entrance. Mirabelle eyes widen realizing what he was doing. The odd sensation driving her curiosity."~I-I-I don't know b-but we can find out.~", Mirabelle answered shakily gripping the table to brace herself. Caleb pushes his head in as Mirabelle clenches her teeth throwing her head up. In a quick motion, her thrusts himself deep as he could inside. He grits his teeth at the newfound tightness."~HEEEEEEE A-AHhhh-OOoooooohoohoooo~", Mirabelle shrieks at first from the painful discomfort of her asshole being spread apart soon relaxing at the foreign sensation."SHIT! Sorry Moon-ah", Caleb apologized pulling out but stops when balled up paper hits his forehead."I-I didn't say 'stop'! Y-you started this now you keep going!", Mirabelle stated puffing her cheeks while trembling.Caleb smirks his aura surging becoming more aroused by this woman, "Can do!"He thrusts himself deep as he could within her grunting in pleasure as she arches her back feeling every inch of his cock push inside with little resistance thanks to the lubricant. He begins thrusting slowly to get her used to the sensation. Mirabelle feels the pain and discomfort she felt before gradually melting away as she adjusts to and begins enjoying the new sensation."~Haa...F-Faster! ~", Mirabelle stated mouth agape and breath ragged. Caleb complies speeding up his pace while gripping her hips tighter. She moans erratically as her breast undulate against the creaking table. Caleb grunts and moans enjoying that squeezing around every inch of him."AHHGH DAMN baby you're so tight Haaaa!", Caleb groan as ripples of pleasure inducing through the Centaur body."~N-No I'm nahahaAAHot! Y-YOU'RE just too big! HAAaaa fuck it hurts sooo good! Harder! Faster! Make my bum take the shape of your COCK!~", Mirabelle stated her eyes rolling upward and mouth agape as hot breath escape with every strained gasp. Caleb obeys pounding her ass harder and faster the slap of his thighs and horsey rear along with their moaning and lewd intercourse sounds filling their senses and increasing their lust. Lyca watches them blushing and trembling as she fondles her slit and asshole from behind see them mate like the Alphas in her old bodies ripple and pulsate with purple aura and purple mist raptures from Mirabelle tail cover the room in ethereal shining purple mist with tiny purple electric spark ripling through. It covers Lyca and Camilla, waking the latter, as purple sparks ripple through their bodies and their eyes take on a purple for a moment and their lust intensifies.The mist spreads out through the crack in the doorway covering Drei body.'What the hell? What is thi-', Drei thought before her eyes shot open taking on a purple glow with images of Caleb...pounding her from behind along with the pleasure she almost feel as her body quivers with lust. She gathers whatever shreds of willpower to grab a small capsule, opens it, and pops a little red medicine ball into her mouth and biting into it. Her eyes shot wide as her eyes return to normal but her mouth is set ablaze with pain like a ghost pepper just lit itself on fire in her mouth. She falls to her knees clenching her mouth as her eye water then uses her sleeve to protect herself from the rest of the mind-altering mist. She stealthily grabs her phone, 'Dammit, guess I can't stay for awhile. Sorry Caleb, you'll have to endure on your own until then. In the meantime, FUUUUUUUUUUUCK!', she mentally screams as she sprints to the nearest water source.Back inside, Caleb continues pounding Mirabelle's ass as rippling purple energy sparks with each collision of their hips. Mirabelle face is contorted in pure, perverted ecstacy as drool escapes her mouth and her mind consumed with lust. It was at the point she didn't even care what he did to her anymore. He could hurt her and she wouldn't mind! As long as it's a scar from him!"Haaa...haa Moon pie I'm gettin' so close!", Caleb groans gripping her sides tighter, "You...You want it here or your pussy?!""~E-Either's fine Nnhagh! MMMahh Haa Haaaa...jus cumb insibe me.~", Mirabelle encouraged in lust-fueled delerium.Caleb gives her a few more thrusts before suddenly pulling out, much to her confusion and slight fear, then shoves himself right into her soaking wet pussy; deciding he wanted to finish inside her wonderful, addicting walls. Mirabelle screams out in euphoric bliss feeling him inside her again."~HAAA DEAR! I LOVE YOOUUUUU!", Mirabelle screams as her heavy orgasm hits her like a truck."I love you too Moon Pie! AARHHHHHH!", Caleb joins flooding her pussy with his hot load.Caleb catches his breath leaning against her side before straightening himself a pulling his length out of her as the mixture of their orgasms leak from her entrance. Mirabelle slumps her trembling upper body against the table mumbling to herself."S-ho amazing...I think I hab a new addiction.", Mirabelle muttered mouth agape in a pure ecstasy.Caleb giggles before petting her back allowing her to rest while simultaneously feeling pride in his work but also feeling tired and thinking he needed to recharge after coming 4 times in a row."~Chiiieef~", "~Senooor~", came the voices of Lyca and Camilla from behind as he turns around eyes widening at the sight. Both lay on the floor purple mist surrounding them., Camilla on her back wings sprawled and legs spread with Lyca right on top of her presenting her butt and tail wagging. Caleb raises an eyebrow at the sight."~Us next Chief! I want that too!~", Lyca stated spreading her firm, plump butt cheeks wantingly mushing her A-cups that were eclipsed by Camilla's massive flesh mounds."~Me too Señor! I don't know why but I really want what Señora just had!~", Camilla spoke reaching down to spread her voluptuous ass too, "~I do not care who goes first, just do not forget me!~"Caleb feels himself getting hard again feeling along with his aura surrounding his body. He smirks getting his second wind, 'Nevermind don't need the break. We're back in business!', he thought before before teleporting over to them. He gets on his knees, grabs Lyca's rear, and buries himself into her tight ass making the She-wolf arch her back howling and yipping in surprise."~ARFARF Haaaaa oohhh Arf ahaa o-oh Chief! CHEIF!", Lyca barks and yips at the feeling her crevice being stretched and pounded. There was slight discomfort but the pleasure she felt from being mounted from behind by her Alpha. Caleb groans and grunts at the tight flesh surrounding him; even tighter than Moon pie. He quickens his pace fucking her...her-style(heh) making her scream out in ecstacy. Below her, Camilla moans softly feeling hers and the She-wolf dripping wet womanhoods rubbing together and her flesh giggling about with every thrust from Caleb. She sees the lewd but very happy expression and was starting to feel left out until...YoinkCamilla eyes widen as sudden jolt of pleasure shot up her spine making her gasp in surprise. She looks up to see Caleb stoking her tail with his fingers smiling at her."Thought ya might be getting lonely down.", Caleb remarks stroking the spade-shaped tip then caressing it with lips even nibbling at it as he strokes it."H-Aaa...ahh ahhh S-Senor! Hahhh! Ahhh Ay Diablos mia!", Camilla moans arching her as her body trembling with every wave of pleasure coursing through her body. Caleb then got a devilish idea and moves the tip in between her and Lyca pussies beginning to scrape it against them both. Both girls eyes shot wide before eliciting lengthy moans and grunts at the intense sensation.Caleb then feels a familiar softness against his back and turns unsurprised to see Mirabelle smirking as she kneaded her breasts into him."Hahh y-you recover fast haaa.", Caleb smirks still trying to keep up his pace."~What can I say? I'm always in the mood for seconds. or thirds. Maybe even fourths.~", Mirabelle whispers breathily in his ear with bright purple eyes."Haa you glutton.", Caleb teases his irises glowing."Only for you my love.", Mirabelle says before capturing his lips which he returns. They quickly started a full makeout session as more purple haze spreads throughout the room. The lascivious sounds of everyone's pleasured moaning and grunting filled the room as the full moon shined from the window....2 hours of non-stop sex later...After putting out the inferno in her mouth and after the sex noises no longer reverberated down the hall, Drei enters the room to make her 'assessment'. Caleb and the girls were all fast asleep. Caleb sat on the floor back slumped against the bed in deep sleep. Around him, Lyca sprawled on her back and the floor next to him softly snoring, Camilla lying in Caleb's bed blissfully asleep and arm limply dangling over Caleb shoulder possessively, and Mirabelle next to him with her legs folded in and laying her head to the bed using her arms as a pillow and softly snoring. Drei walks in carefully stepping around the little 'creampie puddles' on the floor. When she was in front of them she notices girls had a looks of satisfaction on their faces. She gives a small smirk then turns to a softly snoring Caleb."Huh, not bad. You actually managed to keep up with and satisfy them all...and without shattering your pelvis. Not bad for a human.", Drei comments actually a bit impressed. She then notices parts of his thighs DID in fact have some dark black bruise on them. Likely from letting them ride him a few times; some were large enough to cause him great discomfort in the morning. Drei shrugs not surprised, "buuut still a human nonetheless."She then takes out a vial and rubs a greenish-yellow liquid between her hands. She kneels between his legs, ignoring his exposed flacid genitals, then rubs it on both thighs and circular motion with eyes closed in concentration."Huīfù bìng tìhuàn(restore and replace). Huīfù bìng tìhuàn. Huīfù bìng tìhuàn.", she softly repeated this phase as the bruises quickly heal up as the skin returns to it's usual brown tone. She contiinues rubbing opening her eye look up at Caleb seeing a small grin appear on his sleeping face. She tilts her head.'Huh. I guess I'm stirring up a pleasant dream he's having.', she thought as she finishes her treatment. Before she raises up she notices Caleb's quickly growing erection. Her eyes widen noticing, 'Or.. maybe it was wet dream.'She stares at it remembering the first time after the last full moon when she first saw it...and how it felt in her hand. She reaches out and places her hand the tip of his member gently squeezing it proceeds to stroke him with her soft, dexterous fingers making him moan softly in his sleep. She could see his precum forming at the tip and his musky scent wafts toward her. She parts and unparts her small pink lips.'Stop. Why are you doing this again?', Drei thought berating herself softly blushing before images of what she saw in her mind earlier incessantly bombard her. She tries to shake them out but she feels an aching in her core. She releases his member standing to her feet with a listless expression. She looks between Mirabelle and the others making sure they were fast asleep then gingerly lays a hand to his chest , "Ok...just...just this once.", she softly spoke before removing her spandex shorts tossing them to the side.She covers his member in a vial of light yellow oil making him shift slightly. She squats positioning her back to him and lining her rear, with her tail out of the way, up with his member. She sinks down clenching her and wincing as she impales her ass all the way to the shaft. She grits her teeth at the pain while resisting the urge to moan and shriek. Caleb eyes shot open at the sudden tight, hot sensation around his cock."Huh!? Haaa...", Caleb snaps moaning clenching his teeth feeling him cock being repeated thrusted on. He looks down expecting to see any of the three girls but was shocked to see the familiar child-like form and small pointed ears, "W-Wha?! D-Drei-ack!", he flinches feel her pinch her claws into his thighs."B-Be quiet! You don't..ah want to wake them do you?", Drei forced out continuing to ride him feeling her crevice being stretched out more and more. Caleb eyes darts to Mirabelle and the other as they shift in their sleep. He had no idea how they'd react if they saw this. Whatever THIS was."Whaahh w-what the hell ahh are you doing?!", Caleb groaned out trying to keep his voice down."I'm making bread. W-What does it look like ahh.", Drei sarcastically retorted speeding up her pace as her cute and small but plump rear audibly slaps against his thighs, "Now haa...d-don't move. And no touching!"Caleb throws his head upwards his chest heaving feeling her incredibly tight and pleasurably malleable region. There was some sort of lubricating feel to allowed him to slide inside with much trouble. He knew this was messed up but he couldn't help actually enjoying it. He notices as Drei bounces up and down, grunting and softly moaning, she would not look his way. Also, he movements were a bit clumsy and hasty as if wanting finish quickly.He instinctively grabs her sides to adjust her. She immediately smacks them away hard to his confusion."Haa...I said no touching hngh!", She spoke just loud enough for him to hear as she quickens her pace pounding him harder. Caleb groans feeling himself almost at his limit which the wind weasel could sense as well, "H-Hurry up and come already. It's my ass so it's fine. Just do it already!"At her urging, Caleb couldn't help himself and groans before firing his load deep inside. She clenches her eyes trembling choking out her moans feeling his burning load in her butt. Caleb leans back catching his breath as she does the same her back to his chest. When relaxed enough, she removes herself from him stumbling slightly as his cum leaks from her back entrance. She bends over picking up her shorts as Caleb watches equal parts confused, surprised, and aroused."What...the hell was that?", Caleb demands as she puts on her shorts not answering, "Why...I mean do you-""I don't like you.", Drei spoke her back turned to him, "Well...not in THAT way at least. I was just...confirming something."Caleb gives her a 'what the fuck' stare, "confirming what exactly?"Drei doesn't answer. She discretely takes out a vial and dips each of her claws in blue viscous liquid before hiding it away and turning to him."That only for me to know...for now. As for you, it's time to wake up. ", she said.Before Caleb could question her, he feels a sharp prick in his neck."Ahhhhh!", Caleb sharply inhales shooting up awake looking around his room seeing he was still naked and the girls were still around him. Drei was nowhere to be found; not even a trace of her presence ."Mmmmm what's wrong Dear?", Mirabelle uttered stirring from her slumber."No...nothin' Moon pie...everything is alright. Sorry just...go on back to sleep.", Caleb says petting her head."Yaawwwn ok.", Mirabelle utter laying against the bed drifting back to sleep.Caleb sat up thinking to himself. Was that really just a dream? It felt incredibly real. Way to real. Why would he dream of...doing THAT with Drei? Why DREI in particular?! Why did she seem so cold? Like...she want to enjoy it.Caleb rubs his forehead down the back of his head noticing he was getting a bit of an afro; he needed a haircut. He honestly didn't think too much of it. Hell he's had plenty of weird ass dreams lately especially ones with Mirabelle and the dreamscape. He look to each of the girls all sleeping soundly around him knowing he had broken GOD knows how many laws tonight. So...why was he calm...even happy; genuinely happy. He hasn't felt it in a very long time. If there really is a God...he was truly feeling blessed right now.Caleb relaxes deciding to stop thinking and enjoy this moment, 'hehe, what a life.', he thought falling asleep....In the living room, the littlest of the twister sisters sat up on the couch clenching a small pillow to her chest. She sighs looking toward the hallway pensively wondering if what she was doing was worth it. This personal mission of hers was important but...She closes her eyes still able to feel the sensation in her rear. She scoffs turning away not wanting to entertain these complicated feelings anymore before limply flopping down to the side burying her face in the pillow and groaning.......Meanwhile, next door.." *snore* hehe...haaa...Lyca...Boss...", muttered Zwei in her sleep as she lay sprawled out in the bed, covers sloppily thrown ever which way. Her pajamas consisting of an oversized grey T with 'Gamer Girl' in green text pronounced by her perky breast and green panties accentuating her firm thighs and slender, furry legs; no bra. She moans in her sleep tossing and turning.Zwei's dreamInside of a Western themed love motel, Caleb and Lyca were going at it. They were both half naked with Caleb groping and teasing the She-wolf as she moaned in desire. He bends her over the bed pulling down her underwear. He then pulls out his monsterous, brown veiny cock."~Haa...Haa yes Chief! Take me, please!~", Lyca moans feeling wiggling her sexy rear enticingly.Unbeknownst to them, Zwei sat watching in the closet next to them naked and furiously masturbating with a brown dildo and drooling at the erotic sight. She bites her lip as he take his huge member lining up with Lyca's soaking we opening getting a good view of both their tight sexy butts."Oh! Chief wait!", Lyca stated surprising Caleb and Zwei, "It's no fun if we all don't join in. I want Zwei to join us too! Think you can handle a wolf AND a weasel Chief?"Zwei gives a surprised look before the doors of the closet fly open with Caleb standing with his erect cock right in front of her face and smirking down at her."Heh, only one way to find out.", he stated before forcefully pulling Zwei to her feet making her drop the dildo then throwing her on the bed landing on her back. He climbs over her and passionately kisses her which she eagerly accepts. He pops off her leaving her stunned before attacking her neck working down to her perky C-cups sucking her hard pink nipples hungrily."~AH haaahh o-oh you're hungry huh?~", Zwei moans talking dirty before Lyca climbs over her spreading her steamy wet pussy with her clawed fingers. She then feels Caleb spreading her legs apart caressing her thighs and soft fur."~We are for you~", "~We are for you~", they spoke in unison before Zwei gasps feeling Caleb spreading her insides with his cock making her stomach bulge out slightly. Lyca plops down shimmying her hips wanting Zwei to eat her out.Caleb repeatedly thrusts himself in her tight opening sending intense vibrations throughout the weasel's body making her instinctively wrap her legs. Lyca moans loudly as Zwei tongue greedily explores the She-wolf sweet cherry jar while gripping her plump, firm booty. They soon shift positions. Caleb pound Zwei from behind yankiing and stroking her tail as Lyca lay on her back with head in between her legs slurping and sucking her pussy. It wasn't long before they each reach their limits.Howls of sheer pleasure fill the room as all three of them climax in perfect unision...In the real world, Zwei moans softly shifting in bed rubbing her legs together as her panties grow more and more damp.The room next to her featured a similar sight. Ein lie in her neatly made bed moaning and shifting in her sleep and she cuddles her entire body against a large body pillow. Her attire consisting of a silk translucent green nightgown that accentuated her curves and barely contained her plump thigh and mountainous cleavage, and nothing underneath."~Mmmm...daddy...more...~", she moans with a flushed lewd grin pressing harder against the pillow.Ein's Dream"You performed wonderfully today Ein. I can't tell you how much I depend on and proud to have.", Caleb beams a smile as he pet the top of the weasel's head.Ein squeals happily with a goofy grin her tail twitching erratically and cheeks flushed red, "That makes me so happy sir! I'll always give my all...for you."Caleb traces her hair caressing the side of her face, "Funny you should mention that. Cuz I'm still pissed about you going through my photos with my permission.", he says in a stern voice making her tense up."I-I-I'm sorry sir! Please forgi-""Shssssss hush. I don't wanna hear it.", Caleb says placing a finger to her plump pink lips, "~just take your punishment like a good girl.~"Ein blushes before a bunch of belt hooks come out of nowhere and rip off all her clothes leaving her only in her bra and panties. She looks around to find herself in an expensive looking study with a large redwood desk. She suddenly finds herself bent over that desk with her peach-shaped booty raises and bushy tail erect.*SMACK*"~AHH!~", Ein hollers out feel his strong but kind hand spank her ass hard as a red mark begins to form."Are you gonna respect others privacy from now on? *SMACK*""~YES! HAAAA!~", she bellows as he makes another delivery making her ass jiggle."~I don't believe you. I may need punish you more.*SMACK*~", Caleb says slapping her ass making her arch her back."~YES! PUNISH ME! SPANK ME MORE DADDY!~", Ein shouted her eyes filled with masochistic lust and smiling lewdly in sheer pleasure as he continued to spank her."Hmm what have we here?", Caleb says noticing her soaking wet panties, "How shameless! Getting turned on by a spanking, such a naughty girl!""~I'M A NAUGHTY GIRL! Punish this naughty girl's pussy with your cock daddy!", Ein spoke in delirium literally ripping her panties off exposing her glistening wet pussy. Then spreads her bright red ass cheeks looking back with maddened lust."I intend to.", Caleb spoke whipping out his big brown cock, lining himself, then burying himself to the hilt into her opening making her scream out in sheer pleasure."~AHH AHAA HAA YES! YES! FUCK ME DADDY! YES! CALEB!", Ein screams as he relentlessly pounds her against the desk while fondling her breasts...."Yes...daddy. Punish me...so naughty...", Ein murmurs drooling into her pillow and grinding herself against it smiling with a blush in her cheeks....Hours later, the morning sun was beginning to rise over the city of Huntsville. The sight of the welcoming light cutting away the remaining shadow along the other houses along Caleb's street signalled a brand new day.Or at least it would be. If it weren't for the five strange figures suddenly appearing on Caleb's front yard. They were all dressed in dark purple cloaks adorned with silver ornamental beads and symbols of unknown origin and black face masks over their eyes. The one in the center was adorned with large golden chains around her shoulder with a crescent moon tiara-like head piece and an purple eye mask with gold and red eyeball symbol on it. However, their most striking features were their horse-like ears and purple furred Centaurean lower bodies with wispy purple tails."Have we arrived?", inquired the one in the center her silky smooth voice sounding refine and elegant like British noblewoman staring intently at the house."Yes, High Priestess.", answered one the Centaur women in a regal tone.The apparent High Priestess Centaur woman nods before removing her eye mask revealing her gem-like purple eyes with tiny black crescent moon-shaped pupils........WRWOOO THAT WAS FUN! Sup Fam! How is everybody doing? Hope you are enjoying the holiday season. I am, for the most part. Three of my uncles did pass away this month, one of whom...actually served as inspiration for Caleb's uncle in the story. Honestly, he passed just a few days after Second Opinion, which especially hurt. After a much needed grieving period, I eventually got back to work on this chapter.Buuut I also had to finish my finals for the school year ( passed all of them btw) and a had to work on getting permanent state license for my life insurance business( got 3 new clients families covered now). Then, as if to screw with me, a power outtage knocks out my computer WHILE I was typing the ending( didn't save like an idiot) and had to write it ALL over again.After much delay, this chapter is OUT and DAMN was it fun to write. For those of you that survived, the 'pleasure' count was at 69 and no that was not intentional. I actually went back and counted and laughed my goddamn ass off. Hope you guys the chapter, let me know your favorite parts, what didn't work for you, and what you would've wanted to see (fot future reference).Heh, you know looking back at the beginning of this story, I realize that I didn't start developing a style, tone, world, or the characters until like chapter 5. I thought of doing a rewrites in the past but I'm not anymore. They're going to stay as is to remind myself how far I've come. I bring this up because my birthday is next week and I'm feeling a bit reflective. So ignore this if y'all want.Alright, that's talk from me. Be sure to fav, follow, and share. Stay safe this Christmas. PEACE FAM!P S.: you have no idea how many requests I got to put WAP references in here. More than zero.
  
    Chapter Text
    Chapter 39: Uninvited GuestsThe Centaur High Priestess scans the outside of the single story house examining every detail with a quizzical gaze. She taps her hoof against a patch on the lawn up uprooting some of the soil. She nods to herself appearing pleased that the land was at least healthy. She closes her eyes focusing as purple wispy aura covers them. From her view, the house takes on a darkened transparent appearance the only thing being five glowing amorphous blobs that quickly take the distinct body shape of it's inhabitants; all of them sleeping creating openings for each of their dreamscapes. She focuses on two in particular that gave off a very unique energy and locks onto them."We proceed inside. Take the one in the living room.", she spoke addressing her associates who obediently agree. She turns her head slightly to a man watching them curiously from the other side of the street with his Boston Terrier barking energetically at them and taking pictures on his phone. Her associates ignore it all vanishing in flash of purple mist shocking the man as he tries to gain control over over his canine. He hastily continues down the sidewalk.The High Priestess covers her eyes with the mask turning away dismissively as the human gets his dig under control to dial a number and report the strange characters. Before he could, he and his dog are hit with a pulse of purple energy that envelops their being. The man stops staring blankly in a trance carefully as the dog sits quietly not making a sound. He turns around facing the High Priestess with vacant, purple eyes. He presents the phone to her before forcefully snapping the device in half and dropping it to the ground. He turns walking away pulling his dog along by the leash completely forgetting about the strange Centaurs as a shroud of mist wafts where the High Priestess once stood.Meanwhile, inside the house, Drei could be seen lying on the couch her head buried in the pillow. She barely slept at all last night. Between seeing to that Caleb and the others could fully progress as romantic partners without things getting too out of hand, keeping her sisters OUT of the mix at all this time, AND doing the usual perimeter sweep for would be threats, she was basically on the verge of collapse. The only thing that kept her awake, incessantly bouncing around in her mind, was what happened between her and Caleb.Whatever was in that mist, it had some sort of aphrodisiasical affect that also amplifies neurotic behavior. That's what she kept telling herself at least but WAS that the truth? How much control did she really have? How was she going to face him today and onward? Will he remember or will he believe it really was a dream? How would she explain to everyone if he DOES remember? And...did she actually enjoy the experience? In her mind, she screamed 'NO'...but...somewhere deep in her core..."Ughhhhhhh...I screwed up.", Drei groaned into the pillow digging her claws into fibers. She then raises her head up staring at nothing, "Ok...stay positive. Maybe he won't remember? Maybe he'll just think it was a weird fever dream or something?""~Or maybe he'll confess to you?~", spoke an unknown voice.Drei darts her head to the side surprised to find someone sitting next to her. She quickly notices they physically resembles her except their entire body, even their face, was obscured in murky shadow."Wha...who...what are you? How'd you get in here?!", Drei demanded extending her short scythe from her wrist glaring at the unknown intruder."~Question is, what do you really want?~", the figure insisted in it's distorted voice leaning in on all fours attempting to caress Drei's cheek. Only for Drei to brandish the blade at it's wrist."I want answer, just like I'm sure you don't want me to turn your arms into crimson red faucets. Win-win I say. Now WHO are you?", Drei stated unflinchingly."Huhuhuhu...just everything you choose to keep in the dark.", the figure chuckles sitting up tilting it's faceless head innocently, "sayyy, for example...your opinions toward that man in the other room."Drei eyes widen a moment falling silent. The figure leans in with body language suggesting they were being snarky."Why fight it? Come now, accept me. Do that and who knows, maybe he will like you back.", the figure spoke placing it's shadowy hands to Drei's shoulders coming face-to-face with her. The shadow on it's face clears slightly revealing, to Drei's shock, their face was exactly like hers."So what...you're the... manifestation of my emotions and desires, right?", Drei inquires looking the figures in it's faint purple eyes."~Yes, more or less.~""Perfect! *Stab*", Drei stated with a grin before stabbing the blades into both sides if the figures head. It gasps unintelligibly and body convulses before she removes her blades kicking the lifeless corpse off the couch as it gives it's final death throws. Drei gives a morose glare, "You have no idea how long you've had that coming.""MY GOODNESS!", Shrieked an unknown feminine voice.Drei eyes shoot open as two strange women stood around the couch dressed in dark purple cloaks."Emmeryne, what are you doing?! You broke the bloody link!", reprimanded the one standing to Drei's side on the couch in a thick"I'm sorry, Elaine! She startled me! I didn't expect her to react to violently!", Stated the other one standing between the couch.Drei immediately jumps to her feet startling the both of them as she notices their horse-like bodies. She brandishes her scythes going on the defensive at the Centaur intruders."EEEEH! S-She's awake!", Shrieked the one in front of her instinctively backing away slightly trembling."And you're all sticky!", Drei stated."Wha-MMMMPH!", the Centaur gasps in confusion before the weasel tossed a green pellet splattering her face in sticky, green substance that sets like rubber. She struggled to rip it off."Elaine!"Drei pivots and lunges toward the panic button only to be repelled by a purple energy field. Drei lands on her feet instantly recognized this power. Before she could put the pieces together, Emmeryne teleports in front of her."N-No you don't!", she stated pointing her palms at Drei's head sending pulses of purple aura throughout her body. Drei's body becomes increasingly numb and heavy as her eyes take on a faint purple glow. The enemy's voice becomes increasingly distorted. She tries her hardest to resist falling unconcious, "Don't fight it, j-just let go."Drei glares at her clenching her teeth before collapsing to her knees then faceplanting on the floor instinctively using arm to cushion her fall."Haaa that was close.", Emmeryne sighs in relief, "Ah! Elaine, you alright?!""MmmPAHH! *cough* haa...haa...I am now.", the other Centaur, called Elaine, elicited up ripping the substance off her mouth and nose finally able breath. Her hands emanate a flame-like purple aura and she easily tears off the weird rubbery green substance from her eyes, "What in Nix's name is this stuff? Oh nevermind, did you subdue her?""Yes. I placed her consciousness under a deep sleep spell.", Emmeryne answered, "Good thing two, she gave me quite a fright.""I agree, but what's most important is the High Priestess isn't disturbed.", Elaine replied stepping up to where Drei lay motionless then kneeling down preparing to turn her over, "Now, let's continue finding what we can from-"Elaine stops surprised when she turns Drei over a small glowing device lay under her which she recognized as what the humans call smartphones. The screen had the words 'Bigger sis' written in Chinese characters.'HELLO?! DREI, can you hear me?! DREI?!', came the voice of Ein on the phone."W-What in the-Did she just CALL someone?!""EHH?! B-B-But how?! I made sure she was...wait...what is...?", Emmeryne said before noticing the tooth mark wound on the weasel's hand with blood still trickling out. Emmeryne face turns pale, "Did she...BITE herself to stay conscious and call for help?!""I don't know! It's in Chinese! I only know Korean!", Elaine stated in distress.'Who are you two?! What have you done to Drei?! How did you get through the perimeter?! ANSWER ME!', Ein demanded."S-Say something, Emmeryne!", Elaine advised Emmeryne who stutters for a moment before reluctantly picking up the phone making sure she spoke into the correct end."E-Everything is fine. This girl is fine. There's a little blood and she's unconcious but she's A-okay! No need to worry!", Emmeryne stated quickly immensely nervous trying to sound chipper as Elaine jaw drops in utter disbelief.'...click.', the phone hangs up."WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?!""I DON'T KNOWHOHOHOOO!", Emmeryne cried out on the verge of tears....Next door...Adrenaline overtakes Ein's senses as she tosses the phone to the bed and quickly dashes out of her room to Zwei's room the one door down. She barges right in."ZWEI WAKE UP!", She shouted."AHH!", Zwei gasp nearly jumping out of her skin and falls out of bed with a thud. She rubs her now sore head groaning at the rude awakening, "Mrrghhh What?!""I got a call from Drei. We have to get to Mr. Bizzell and the others right now! We have intruders and I think they've done something to Drei and the others!", Ein quickly explained.Upon hearing this, Zwei tail stands erect and her eyes widen in realization. She kicks herself up to her feet going into attack mode."Well let's go!", Zwei stated before passing Ein before leaping down from the stair railings. Ein quickly follows her out the front door as it slams behind them. Both totally oblivious of their less than professional....back at Caleb's house...The High Priestess stood outside Caleb's bedroom door with two of her attendance stationed on either end of the hall. Her body faintly covered in purple aura. She focuses as her the aura grows in intensity."Both of you take care of the Demoness and the Werewolf. Leave the others to me.", The High Priestess informs."Understood.", both answered before striking meditative poses. Their bodies begin radiating purple aura.The three Nightmare proceed to slip into respectively victim dreamscape....Lyca's Dreamscape...*Elton John's 'I'm Still Standing' plays in the background*The sun was shining on a large open grassy field with cluster of trees off to the side. Lyca and her pack were enjoying a game of free-for-all Water Balloon Dodgeball.Splash'Gotcha Cami!', Lyca cheered as the She-Devil's wing were splattered wet with water.'Ohhh I am going to get ju for-WAH!', Camilla exclaims after receiving a water balloon to the butt then whips her head to see the culprit was Ein giggling with a wide grin."Hahaha, be cautious of your surroundings-AH!", Ein chided before recieving a balloon to the face knocking her to the group."Revenge!", Mirabelle exclaims before Camilla chanted it too be summon several green magic seals above Ein, who looks up in horror, before dozens of balloons rain out pelleting the wind weasel. Camilla and Mirabelle chuckle heartily before both getting hit with balloons from a new challenger. It was Zwei standing atop a small mountain of balloons launching with a high velocity wind tunnel."REVENGE revenge HAHAHAHAHAAAA!", Zwei laughed victoriously before Caleb teleports behind her striking her in the back making her stumble. She looks behind her but he teleports striking her in the face knocking her to the ground, "*HACK* Cough cough heyyy! I was doing something cool!""Welllll I was somethin' cooler.", Caleb remarks with a smirk."I'M GONNA GETCHA CHIEF!", Lyca shouted jubilantly chasing after him as Caleb runs away laughing and dodging a few hits but getting hit a few times."Don't forget about us!", came the voice of Hollo. She appears along with Mahkah and the rest of their pack joining in on the water balloon brawl.In the middle of all this, Drei could be seen eating curly fries and listening to music on her phone while casually dodging and ducking stray balloons. Lyca could be seen with her sister laughing and soaking wet along with their packmates. Both of their bellies suddenly poking out as both sisters can't wait for their puppies to have this much fun. All the while a humanoid figure watches at a distance dressed in a purple cloak....Lyca lay sprawled on the floor giggling and smiling in her sleep completely naked as her tail occasionally thumps the floor. Next was Camilla....Camilla's Dreamscape...Camilla, in her child form, could be seen running for dear life panting in exhaustion with a metal collar on her neck. Behind her was nothing but darkness, the only light being a womanly figure with Devil-like features."Madre! Madre!", Baby Camilla chanted reaching out as hard as she could only for the womanly figure to turn and walk away getting further and further no matter how fast Camilla ran. Tears well from her eyes as she morphs from child to adolescent form as the light grows dimmer and the darkness envelops her, "MADREEEEEE!"Camilla then hears a multitude of voices all vilifying, mocking laughter, insulting and cursing at her, and black shadowy hands reach out to grap her from all angles. Her red eyes burn with rage as she summons two red magic seal before screaming a battle cry firing beams of red lightning around her destroying the hands only for dozens more to take their place. A rifle fires shooting off part of her ear making her since before a blade slashes her wing. A spear pierced her stomach making her cry out in agony before collapsing to her knees. The shadow hands sieze her grabbing her horns, pulling her hair, clawing, punching, or stabbing her as she grunts in agony. She feels sets of cold, slimy, disgusting hand reaching between her legs molesting her regions along with the sound of her clothes being ripped apart. She screams as tears trickle down her cheeks.Suddenly, the hand pause before releasing her body as pulses of purple energy was over her. Camilla slowly sits up noticing hands retreating into the darkness and the voices to cease replaced with still silence. Her eyes widen upon seeing a hand reach out from the darkness covered in a warm purple light. She hesitates but reaches out and grasps the hand. It's grin was strong but also kind and accepting. The darkness dissolves around her as pulses of purple aura ripples throughout her body repairing her clothes and healing her wounds leaving only scars that fade slightly but still remain. The arms entire body is revealed to Caleb standing over her smiling warmly."It's ok. You're safe now.", he spoke as her eyes widen with surprise and hope before he pulls her to her feet. She changes from her adolescent to her adult present day form. Their eyes remain locked on each other before she notices several more figures approach them; Mirabelle, Lyca, Ein, Zwei, Drei, even Scarlett and the other Devil girls. Her new familia. A smile forms on her face feeling loved for the first time in decades then feeling Caleb gingerly caress her cheek and say 'I love you' before they kiss passionately.Next scene shows Camilla lying in bed grunting and screaming in pain with Caleb and Mirabelle gripping her left and right hand respectively for support. Ein, Scarlett, and the other Devil girls stood around her encouraging her. Her belly was swollen with Drei between her legs, Zwei holding towels on the verge of fainting, encouraging her to 'Keep pushing'. Seconds later, and Camilla panting and sweating in exhaustion, the cries of a newborn baby could be heard throughout the room. Drei approaches Camilla with a bundle of grey towels."Congratulations...it's a littler devil girl."Camilla eagerly takes the bundle and uncovers the face revealing the most beautiful thing she's ever seen. It's tiny face, dark brown complexion, along with tiny black devil horns, wings, and tail, and eyes tightly shut. Caleb leans over wiping his tears away unable to stop smiling as Camilla giggles caressing their child."She's perfect.", he utters to which Camilla wholeheartedly agrees. Their daughter opens her eyes for the first time and coos upon seeing her parents. Mirabelle, and the others immediately crowd around them eager to see to newborn and newest member of their clan as a figure cloaked in dark purple robes observes quietly....Camilla stirs in her sleep on Caleb's bed sighing as a content grin forms on her face. Beside her, said man was fast asleep with Mirabelle snuggling his shoulder....Dreamscape...Caleb and Mirabelle sat atop a cliff overlooking a vast, sparkling ocean cuddling and enjoying the view of the sunrise. The scent of salty sea air and the sound of the waves crashing against the shoreline along with the cool, refreshing breeze filled their senses with pure calmness. He wasn't sure when she entered his dream, even though she never actually TELLS him when she'll do it, he didn't much care."What do you think Dear?", Mirabelle spoke."It's beautiful Moon pie?", Caleb commented with a smile, "What you said this place was called?""It's called Kynance Cove. I came here a lot as a child. I always felt...safe...here. I wanted to share it with you.", Mirabelle reminisces staring off into the distance letting the breeze blow through her hair, "I want to bring you here for real some day. In fact, I would love to show you where I grew up...but..."Caleb notices her tone turning somber then sees her pensive expression "It's alright Moon pie, no need to be in a hurry. We got all the time in a world. I mean...i'm in no hurry to go back to my hometown, but I'd like to show y'all around sometime...just not now. I'm sure it's how you feel too, right?"Mirabelle looks to him but doesn't make eye contact, "Y-yes...mostly."Sensing the subject was becoming awkward for both of them, Caleb flips it."Last night was...intense wasn't it? The full moon is somethin' else", Caleb remarks with a smirk, "I love it when you let out your inner freak."Mirabelle face flushed bright red, "S-Shut up! Y-y-you were the one who...""Whooo drove you crazy in the first place? Like making you and Camilla put on that little show?", Camilla smirked as Mirabelle jaw drops remembering her make out session slash double tit fuck with Elder Devil. The sensation of her lips to hers and their nipples scraping together still, embarrassingly, fresh in her mind."Ohhh, not just her, LYCA too!", Caleb continues teasing, "You three were reaaaally enjoy yourselves."Mirabelle blushes ever deeper shade of red, "T-T-T-T-T-T-T-THAT WAS...I-I just... got caught in the moment! I-I wasn't thinking straight! Y-You seemed to enjoy it EVEN MORE! Pervert! D-Dirty Pervert!""Yeah but I'm YO Dirty Pervert.", Caleb jeered before booping her noise making her form quiver in embarassment and frustration."For real though, I'm glad you guys came to an understanding and nobody had to hurt or be jealous of anybody. I love all y'all. I really do and yesterday...was one of the best of my life.", Caleb spoke gently caressing his girlfriend's cheek as she stares at him contently."I agree, my love. And...I can't wait to have many more like it from now on.""Yeah. But uhh...maybe not all y'all at once on a regular basis. I'm still human with a human pelvis I wanna keep in tact.", Caleb cheekily spoke before Mirabelle scoff and playfully bumps his shoulder."Oh come off it, Dear! I prefer one-on-one intimacy more than the next but I wouldn't mind the others joining...if we want. Besides, you seemed to handle all of us just fine! You were quite energetic.", Mirabelle chuckled before realization hits her, "In fact, you were giving off a warm and...strong energy"Caleb gives a thoughtful look, "Y-Yeah...I did remember feeling...very, VERY aroused and... even felt stronger. Like I could do anything.""You even radiated this...wonderful scent. I just couldn't hold myself back.", Mirabelle says biting the tip of her finger looking to him wistfully."Heh, did I really? Guess I-", Caleb says an unsettling feeling shoots through his nerve. He then notices a dark purple figure several feet behind Mirabelle, "What the...?"He immediately shoots to his feet to Mirabelle surprise as he backs away a few meters."Hmm? Something wrong Dear?"Caleb glances at Mirabelle then back to the figure only to find they were now gone. He glances around."I...I thought I saw...well, I don't know what I thought I saw...like someone standing behind you in a purple hood or something?", Caleb answered unsure he was describing it right."Huh, that's peculiar. Are you sure you didn't create a something by accident again? You know how your imagination tends to wander.", Mirabelle answered."This is different. It felt like...someone was wa-ack!", Caleb suddenly stops in mid-sentence gagging as her tried to utter a single coherent word before falling completely mute. His body becomes frozen in place as his limbs refuse to obey him command.Mirabelle immediately shoots to her feet(hooves) starting to panic rushing to his aide."Dear! Dear?! What's wrong?! P-Please speak t-", Mirabelle stops when her lower body freezes in place like a statue, "W-What?! Why can't I move my body?! What happened?!""Sigh, I see you are still as indolent as ever.", came a distorted feminine voice that echoed through the dreamscape even making the scenery glitch out like a VR world.Mirabelle eyes shot open as did Caleb's. Although, while Caleb was starting to freak out Mirabelle was uttered shocked by the voice as it was one very familiar to her.Suddenly, a humanoid figure dressed in dark purple robes appeared between them. Their form was noticeable feminine with large curvaceous hips and pronounced G-cup breasts. They were adorned with golden chains and strange crescent moon symbols. Their face was covered in shadow for the pair of haunting, almost demonic purple eyes. Their presence gave off a calm but intimidating aura. Mirabelle recognized this aura but couldn't believe it."N-no...it can't be. W-Why are you here?!", Mirabelle stated in disbelief her body trembling as she struggles to move."Why, you ask? I had to check your progress honey. You haven't reported back in quite some time. I was getting worried.", the figure turns to Caleb, "Then...there's you. You are...an interesting specimen."The figure approaches him coming face-to-face with him glaring unflinchingly with cold, menacing purple eyes. Caleb gulps becoming nervous."So you're the one she's taken a liking to.", the figure spoke titling his chin examining the detail of his face. She places her other hand to his chest to Caleb surprise, "You...are the one she's carelessly bestowed our precious family mark."The mark on Caleb's chest begins to glow bright sending a burning sensation through his body."Gaahh!", Caleb elicits before Mirabelle clenches grunts in discomfort as her mark glows as well. The figure looks over it's shoulder at her"Hmm, so the link has become this strong?" the figure utters be then turns clasp Caleb's forehead. A dark purple miasma covers her hand before Caleb yells in pain as she forces him to his knees, "Now...show me everything. Why does she trust you to such a degree?!""Stop! What are you doing?! Le-mmph MMMPHH!", Mirabelle started only for her mouth to be forced closed as the figure glared back at her with glowing purple eyes."Hush child! I'm doing YOUR work!", the figure answered as the world around them dissolves into thick, dark purple mist. All around them projections of Caleb's life flashes around them. His parents, his brother, his sister, his bullies from school, the accident, his... suicide attempt, all playing before them. The figure the seeing the images of Caleb with Mirabelle and the fun times they spent together. However, the figure was shocked seeing the events of the fourth of July along with the attack from the Fallen Angel and the criminals. Mirabelle struggles desperately wanting to make this stop."GAHHHH!", Caleb screams in pain reliving the memories in full force. Suddenly, his body becomes shrouded in glowing flame-like purple aura as the mark glows brightly on his chest surprising the figure. Mirabelle's body take on a similar glow as she feels she's able to speak again. Caleb shakily raises his arm up and grabs the figure's wrist tightly making them recoil in surprise."Wha?! H-How can-""JUST STOP THIS! *SLASH*", Mirabelle screams as several projections are cleaved in half and disintegrate into mist. The figure turns to Mirabelle seeing her clutching her Dream Scythe with a pleading but determined expression, "Please...he doesn't deserve this!"The figure is taken aback before noticing Caleb shakily standing to his feet taking every bit of energy his had to force himself up. He glares at the figure with anger-filled purple eyes with wispy flames emanating from the corners."T-The isn't possible! How are you able to-GAH?!", the figure spoke in disbelief before Caleb grabs her by the collar. Caleb clenches his fist his teeth balling his fist as the figure trembles."Youuuu..!", Caleb growls through his teeth rage filling his eyes and unnerving the figure."DEAR, NO, STOP IT'S OK!", Mirabelle screamed at him as Caleb looks to her his angered expression softening.The figure seizes the distraction to conjure up their own Dream Scythe. It was a long black shaft with several golden rings ending in a large dark purple blade with gold markings. She brings it down on Caleb with her free hand. Caleb looks up time seems to slow to a crawl at the glistening blade ready to behead him."No!", Mirabelle shouted as her blade collided with the figure's stopping the attack but creates a powerful shockwave covers everything in blinding white light...."AHHHHHHHHH!", Caleb screams to the top of his lung shooting from his sleep as Mirabelle does the same jumping backing into his bookshelf knocking the shelves and it contents down."GAHHH! HYAAAHH! Camilla and Lyca both shout upon being woken up so abruptly with the former instinctively creating two red magic seals in her hands."¡Quedarse atrás! ¡MORIR!(Stay back! DIE!)", Camilla screamed shooting a fireball-like projectile and blow a large hole through Caleb's steel plated bedroom door. Scared by the display, Caleb instinctively teleports out of the room into the hallway his face hitting what he thought was the wall."AH!", shouted an unfamiliar voice the Caleb didn't recognize. Nor did he remember the walls in the hallway feeling smooth like velvet with a sweet lavender aroma. Nor were they EVER soft and squishy!Caleb pushes his face off the 'wall' only to come face-to-face with...Mirabelle? That's what he thought at first, before noticing that her purple hair was longer stopping past her shoulder ending in curled locks, her face was fuller with more mature features, her horsey body was slightly larger, even her breasts were a couple sizes bigger which Caleb realized his hand was digging into with the outline of her flesh spilling through his fingers. He could feel her body trembling as she stares stunned in place. It was at that moment she looks down at the man groping her and, on top of that, he was COMPLETELY naked with his manhood on full display. Caleb notices where she was looking realizes he was still in his birthday body. Her mouth quivers and hangs open and her face turns beet red."Eh...Eh...E-E-E-E-EEEEYAHHHHHH!", the lady shrieks to the top of her lung startling Caleb even more. It was then Caleb noticed the two other purple Centaurs standing on either end of the hall perplexed, shocked, and deeply flustered."W-W-W-W-WHAT ARE DOING TO THE HIGH PRIESTESS?!", stuttered the Centaur closest to the end of the hall."THE WHO?!", Caleb shouted back deeply confused to the Centaur that he was still groping, "THE YOU?!"The High Priestess was to flustered to speak only coming out in unintelligible stutters."R-R-RELEASE HER AT ONCE, HOOLIGAN!", Stated the Centaur on the other end of the hall arms raised forming a ball of purple energy which the other Centaur mimicked. Caleb quickly releases her backing away but trips backwards falling on his butt with a thud. The impact making a hanging picture fall with the solid edge landing right on top of his head."AAOOWW!", Caleb elicits holding the top of his scalp. It hurt like a motherfucker!"DEAR!" "CHIEF!" "SEÑOR!", Mirabelle, Lyca, and Camilla called out greatly concerned for their lover appearing from the bedroom. They were shocked to see the three unknown Centaur standing in the hall with Caleb on the floor back at the wall clenching his head in pain. Lyca and Camilla eyes widen in shock, rage already sending them into 'attack and protect'-mode."Who are ju?! What did ju do to him?!", Camilla spoke in her angry demonic voice as Lyca steps in front of Caleb snarling and baring her fangs daring them to come close."Nothing! He just fell! B-Besides, HE assaulted the High Priestess first!", stated one of the Centaur trembling fearfully as she and her equally fearful comrade put up their guard to protect the High Priestess."Liar! You're intruders in OUR home! And I'll show you how Werewolves deal with intruders!", Lyca snarled baring her fangs and claws as Caleb stands to his feet still rubbing his head putting the two Centaur further on edge. He realizes the three Centaur looked to be Nightmares like Mir"STOP! Everyone stop!", Mirabelle shouted getting everyone attention."Ah! Our apologies Lady Mirabelle!", both Centaur stated regally bowing much the Caleb and the other surprise."Wha? Lady Mirabelle?! Moon pie, what goin' on?!", Caleb stated."Ju know them Senora?!", Camilla inquired not letting down her guard."Yes! They are my...members of my clan! She's Matilda and she's Freya...and she's...my mum.", Mirabelle said gesturing to the left and right respectively then to the High Priestess much to Caleb and the others shock."WHAT?!", "WHAT?!", "QUE?!", exclaimed Caleb, Lyca, and Camilla in perfect unison jaws dropped at the revelation."Thank you for the introduction, sweety. Now, if you don't mind explaining, WHY IN NYX'S NAME ARE YOU BUTT BLOODY NAKED?! WHY ARE ALL OF YOU BUTT BLOODY NAKED?!", Mirabelle's mother shouted her face deeply flushed.Caleb, Mirabelle, and Camilla gasp in realization covering up their privates with their hands. Lyca was the only one NOT freaking out since being seen naked wasn't a big deal in her culture."EEEE I JUST REMEMBERED THEY ARE NAKED!", Matilda, shrieked covering her eyes."W-WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?!", Mirabelle mother demanded."M-M-MOTHER I-I CAN EXPLAI-"WHOOOSH *CRASH*A powerful gust of wind blows through the hall forcing everyone to shield themselves. Suddenly, a form goes flying down the hall. It was Zwei!"BOSS! Crap! They got cl-AHH!", Zwei stated before yet another Nightmare teleports in front of her and repels her back with a magic barrier."Elaine?! What happened?!", High Priestess stated in surprise."I'm sorry, High Priestess! We underestimated the one you spotted in the living room! We subdued her but she managed to call in reinforcements.", Elaine explained quickly in panic before noticing Mirabelle, "Ah hello Lady Mirabelle.""Boss! You and Marequine teleport the others to the panic room! We'll take of them! You're gonna pay for harming my baby sis too!", Zwei stated brandishing her scythes."We said didn't! We put her into a deep slumber. You guys burst in and saw us moving her body to the couch and attacked us! You have to believe me!", Elaine basically pleaded.Suddenly, Ein onto the scene with the other Centaur slung against her shoulder unconcious, bound, and gagged before dropping her to floor."Enemy subdued. You three Centaur don't move! Tell us your intentions right now!", Ein demanded pointing to the High Priestess and her associates."ELAAAAIINNE!", Emmeryne cried out."Jesus Christ, I never noticed how WIDE this hallway is goddamn!", Caleb stated in utter shock."Forget the bloody hallway! Who ARE you two!? Why are in your KNICKERS?! IS THIS SOME SORT OF MADHOUSE FOR EXHIBITIONISTS?!", Mirabelle mother stated pointing out that both Wind Weasels were still in their lingerie. Ein and Zwei pause a second before finally taking a realllllly good look at each other and reality hits them like a semitruck. Caleb's eyes widen at Ein's mountainous I-cups rivaling Camilla's and thicc, curvaceous figure and Zwei's plump booty and slender yet curvy body."AAAAHOHO MY GOD! W-Where are our clothes?!", Ein stated heavily blushing from embarrassment and desperately trying to cover herself, even using her tail to cover her groin."We rushed out without grabbin' 'em! OUR SENSE OF URGENCY BETRAYED US!", Zwei stated equally embarrassed trying to cover herself."L-L-Look away Mr. Bizzell! Look aw-W-WAIT! Why are YOU naked?! WHY ARE ALL OF YOU NAKED?!", Ein stated in utter disbelief."That's- I mean...we were-!", Caleb stated trying to find the right words but coming up short."THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW!", Stated the High Priestess as Ein and Zwei turn their attention to her and the other Centaurs."You're in no position to be asking questions! Who even are you people?!", Ein demanded brandishing her scythe while trying to look intimidating covering her breasts."She's Mira's Mother.", Lyca stated."WHAT?!" Zwei and Ein stated simultaneously."Mummy! Why are you here?!", Mirabelle inquired."Don't change the subject, girl! WHAT WERE YOU DOING?!", High Priestess stated."Y'all can we just-", Caleb says before Camilla jumps in."Don't JU change the subject! Who are ju to barge in as if this is YOUR home!", the demoness shot back."H-How dare you speak to the High Priestess in that tone?! She has every right when it concern Lady Mirabelle!", Matilda defended."Especially for whatever depraved and vulgar acts you all forced her into!", Freya added."Hey it's NOT like th-", Caleb stated only for Mirabelle to jump in."I wasn't FORCED into anything!", she affirmed."And who are ju calling DEPRAVED and VULGAR?! Ju take that back before I shove those words back down your throat!" , Camilla stated visibly agitated still covering herself with her hands but conjuring a blue magic seal in front of her to Mirabelle surprise. High Priestess and her associates but up their guard."Camilla stop! This is-", Caleb is cut off again to his irritation."J-Just try, Demon! Your magic is no match for ours!", Matilda stated purple aura surrounding her body as a small orb of purple light forms in her hand which the other's besides the HIGH Priestess copy."Stand down! All of you!", Ein commanded."You leave Cami alone! If it's a fight you want it's a fight you'll get!", Lyca stated baring her fangs getting in a lunging position."Lyca! All y'all just-""She JUST said 'stand down' Lyca! We'll handle this!", Zwei stated cutting Caleb off and brandishing her scythes.Things were quickly spiralling out of control with both sides verberally and soon quite physically attacking each other.Caleb notices Mirabelle quickly glancing around panicking holding her head and on the verge of tears. He clenches his fist his aggitation reaching it's breaking point as his mark radiate purple radiates purple flames and his eyes glowing ominously while everyone was to busy screaming each other to notice."All...of you...just...SHUT UP!", Caleb voice echoed throughout the house as a powerful pulse of purple energy spreads from his body covering everyone. All of them, even High Priestess, are struck dead silent as the atmosphere grew heavy and looking to the young man like frightened children that have just greatly angered an authority figure."Everyone just SHUT UP! Now...we are all adults here and we're goin' straighten this out! Understand?!", Caleb asserted as everyone reluctantly muttered in agreement, "Aight, Ms. Marequine...High Priestess whatever would you and your entourage please wait in the living room while we get dressed before joining you?"High Priestess stares at him ponderously before answering, "Yes. That would be fine.""That includes you Ein and Zwei! Put some clothes on.", Caleb stated not looking directly at them."B-But we can't just leave you alone with them! Who knows what they could-", Ein interjects before Caleb stops her."If they REALLY wanted to harm us they would have done so by now. They're still Moon pie's family regardless of the circumstances.", Caleb say much to Mirabelle, her mother and the other Nightmares surprise, "If you're really that worried you guys can borrow some of my old clothes. Fine with you?"Ein and Zwei pause for a moment in thought."U-Um...y-yes?", Ein uttered."Good. You'll find some in a box in that closet over there. Damn, now I got me a headache.", Caleb stated removing his hands massaging his temples before noticing Ein, the High Priestess and the other Nightmares suddenly blush deeply averting their gaze and the other glancing downwards at him, "What?""Uhh...Boss? Your ahem...", Zwei blushes hiding a smirk gesturing to Caleb's groin.Caleb pauses inhaling sharply through his nose, "I know. Is it bothering you?", he says in a serious tone while trying to save face.The women pause unsure how to respond to that."Welp, you heard the man! Time for this morning's coffee table meeting.", Zwei stated clapping her hands together, "Right this way then ladies.""Ahem, Right then, we'll be waiting.", High Priestess says shooting a stern gaze toward Mirabelle who recoils glancing away in shame as she and the others proceeded to follow Zwei., "Kindly bring her in too.", High Priestess pointed to the still unconscious Elaine."Of course!", stated pick up the unconscious Nightmare slinging over her shoulder with fairly little effort, "Uh, don't worry she'll wake up soon."As they all proceed out of the hallway to the living room, a few of the Nightmare glance back at them curiously before leaving Caleb and the others alone."Aight, I'm gonna get dressed and heading to the bathroom real quick.", Caleb says before noticing Mirabelle morose expression, "Moon pie? It's gonna be fine, okay?"She looks to him forcing a small grin, "Y-Yes Dear."Caleb looks unconvinced but nods before turning around to his bedroom noticing the large smoldering hole still in his door. Camilla immediately tenses up but he doesn't even look her way. He sighs and simply says, "Gonna deal with THAT later.", before closing the door stepping inside. He grabs some clothes then teleports to the bathroom.Camilla and Lyca look to Mirabelle who wore an uncertain expression."Senora?", Camilla inquired in a concerned tone."L-Let's just...put our clothes on.", Mirabelle spoke before teleporting to her room. Camilla glances to Lyca who just shrugs before they both go off to their rooms....in the living room...Drei lay on the couch a pillow supporting her head when suddenly her eyes shoot open and she quickly sits herself up.'W-What happened? Last thing I remember was-', Drei's thought before being interrupted."Sis! You're awake!", Zwei stated before Drei turns to her surprised to see her in half naked in Caleb's house."Ah! She is?!", Ein stated as Drei's gives a deadpan look as her I-cups dangling over the couch in her face while smiling at her also half naked.Drei then notices the High Preistess and the other Nightmare standing or sitting around the living room including the one, Elaine, who incapacitated her to begin with nervously smiling and waving at her. Drei gives a dry look at the room filled with Mirabelles. She reaches into her sleeve and pulls out a vial of blue liquid."Nope.", She says plainly popping the cork then downing the vial then flopping back on the couch softly snoring. Ein and Zwei exchange questioning looks."She seems...nice.", Emmeryne spoke."Oh shove it, Emmeryne .", Elaine reprimanded still picking Drei's thick white goo off her face........WNSup Fam! How's everyone enjoy 2021 so far?! Things have been...fairly well this past month. Mom is doing better, I'm doing well in all of my classes right now, and I passed both my Insurance license AND my Fundamental of Engineering license exams! So I'd say things are off to a good start. Hope to keep it that way.I hope you enjoyed the chapter. Actually meant to have this posted before MLK day but...I got distracted with the above statement. Sorry to pull the classic, "character is secretly some form of royalty" cliche but, for Mirabelle, it's noooot technically the case. You'll find out what I mean next chapter.Btw, have you guys heard of the manga called 'The 100 girlfriends who really, really, really, really, really love you'? You should! It's funny as hell! If you like harem manga with a protagonist that is ACTUALLY interesting I suggest checking it out.Welp, that's about it. See ya guys soon. Peace Fam!
  
    Chapter Text
    Chapter 40: Family Ties...One awkward amount of time later...After getting themselves together, each group now sat in the living room. The furniture was moved and adjusted to allow space for High Priestess and her associates. Good thing the couch set could be disassembled as reassembled for moments like these.The entire left side of the room close to the front door was occupied by High Priestess and her associates while Mirabelle and the others sat adjacent to them now fully dressed. Mirabelle, Camilla, and Lyca all wore their usual casual clothes. Zwei sat with them dressed some black Adidas sports shorts and light blue t-shirt with the sillouhetttes of seven water-type starter Pokemon on it. Both where a little to big and hung loose but at least gave her some modesty. She wasn't gonna complain. Caleb was nice enough to lend her and Ein some old clothes after their exhibition stunt.Drei was later moved to Caleb's room to rest. Her sister's were curious why she would deliberately use her sleep drug on herself but Caleb informed she was simply 'tired' from last night. He refused to elaborate any further.Quickly sensing the growing tension in the room, Caleb decided to diffuse said tension using good old Hulu and mid-morning breakfast. He put on an American comedy show called 'The Last O.G.' while he got to work in the kitchen with Ein's assistance. Lyca and Zwei were at least enjoying the show cracking up at the jokes. Emmeryne, one of High Priestess associates, couldn't help chuckling as well and was chastised by her peers. The entire time Mirabelle avoided eye contact with her mother as much as possible but could feel her cold gaze pierce her core." *zoom* Alrighty! Who wants some breakfast?", Caleb stated appearing in front of everyone holding a tray full of blueberry muffins and two plates of breakfast wraps along with napkins on foam bowls, "The wraps to left of the garlic chicken and egg and the ones on the right are full of veggies."Lyca and Zwei waste no time in grabbing chicken wraps and muffins with Camilla grabbing a couple for herself. Mirabelle is hesitant but takes a muffin."I also brewed some tea if anyone wants some.", Ein added joining everyone. She wore and oversized grey t-shirt, the only one to fit her, with the words 'The Heavy' in all red going across her breasts along with dark grey sweatpants that hugged her shapely butt."That's quite alright. I would much rather have a explanation right now.", High Priestess brushes him off shooting a look to Mirabelle who tenses up while Lyca, Camilla, and Zwei glare at her."We will. Believe me, we will. But first, you're...well wouldn't say 'invited' but you're guests still and family to my homestay so I'll feed ya.", Caleb puts a warm blueberry muffin and veggie in a foam bowl and presents it to High Priestess, "You're a long way from home so you must be a little hungry. Moon p...I mean Mirabelle just loves these veggie wraps whenever I make'em for her."High Priestess sniffs her ear twitching at the sweet scent of the pastry but keeps her composure not wanting to seem interested."U-um, i-i'll take it.", Emmeryne spoke earning curious looks from her group and Caleb, "I-I mean just to make sure for her protection that it is indeed safe to eat of course.""Ok, sure", Caleb says handing it to her which she graciously accepts.She bites into the veggies wrap and her mouth bursts with the flavor of fresh veggies, light seasoning, and mild sweet onion sauce, "~Hahhhh so yummy! Lady Mirabelle really has these everyday?!~", she blissfully stated her cheek puffed out which Caleb thought was cute as the other Nightmare look to her skeptically."Yep. Those are fresh veggies straight from the farmers market down the road.", Caleb answered as Ein also handed Emmeryne a cup of green tea as Mirabelle watches cautiously. Emmeryne accepts and happily sips the warm liquid sighing blissfully, "Got one satisfied customer. Anyone else hungry?"High Priestess pauses glaring skeptically at the man then noticing her associates watching Emmeryne their mouth watering. She herself couldn't deny her cravings."Ahem very well. It would be rude to reject your hospitality.", High Priestess says in a proud tone while turning away hiding her cheeks flush a light shade of pink.Mirabelle watches curiously as Caleb and Ein proceed to serve her mother and the members of her clan. One-by-one High Priestess' associates faces light up complimenting and thanking the pair. High Priestess herself couldn't help lighting up."This is...exceptional.", She says."Thanks ma'am.", Caleb accepts with a smile to which High Preistess simply nods. Caleb grabs a couple of chicken wraps and sits in his recliner while Ein joins the others.High Priestess looks around seeing her daughters group and her associates enjoying the food while the telly plays in the background. She notices even her daughter seems less bothered by her presence. Heck, SHE herself feels a lot calmer and...welcome in this man's home. What is happening here? What kind of power is this?After a good ten minutes, most of the food and tea were already gone and everyone seemed to be more relaxed. Caleb decided to get things rolling."Ok. How about we get things rolling?", Caleb says clapping his hands together and proceeds to turn off the tv."Awww", "Awww I was really getting into it.", Lyca and Zwei whined."You guys can pick it up later.", Caleb quickly assured before turning to high Priestess, "Alright, my name's Caleb Bizzell. I'm your daughter's host. This is Lyca Kessler and Camilla Sartana, I'm their host as well.""Hi.", "Hola", Lyca and Camilla greeted respectively."This is Ein, Zwei, and Sleeping Beauty in the back is Drei. The Zyklon sisters.""Hello.", "Heyo!", Ein and Zwei chimed in."Charmed to meet you all.", High Priestess spoke in a dignified tone, "I am Madeline Marequine, 29th High Priestess of the Crescent Moon clan. These four are my Retainers, Matilda, Elaine, Freya, and Emmeryne Marequine.""Pleasure to meet you all.", all four simultaneously greeted in a regal tone."Pleasure is ours. So, are you all Mirabelle's sister's or...?""Oh, no no! We are in no manner related to the High Priestess by blood. In fact, we each belong to different clans.", Matilda clarified."We're more akin to attendants and protectors to the High Priestess and her successors.", Elaine added."Sooo why the shared surname? Oof, that's a tongue biter.", Zwei says."You mean twister?", Ein corrected."No, of course not. That's biologically impossible.", Zwei replies as a few of them raise an eyebrow."Well, when a new High Priestess steps into power, she is given the option to choose her retainers from either within her own clan or from a sister clan. Only one per clan. Afterwards, we temporarily the family name until the next High Priestess decide otherwise.", Elaine continued."Hehe, nevertheless, we treat the other members as our sisters and we assist and raising her successor. We've been with Lady Mirabelle since she was the cutest little babe.", Emmeryne croons as Mirabelle blushes in embarassment."Indeed she was.", Matilda joined in adding to her embarassment, "She would always come up with the silliest games to play.""Hoho, remember the first time she met the Dryad Chief and she-", Elaine stated but was cut off when High Priestess Madeline audibly clears her through getting all her retainers attention who quickly return to their stern, regal form."While we are on that topic, I believe it's time we get back to our primary topic of discussion.", HP Madeline spoke focusing on Mirabelle who shifts her gaze to her lap, "Daughter, what have you done?"Mirabelle tenses up gripping her skirt, "I...I...I was...just...""Just wasting time on trivial things as per usual? Running off and neglecting your responsibilities to your clan?! Tarnishing the sanctity of family crest?! Are ANY of those correct?!", HP Madeline scolded as her retainer gives looks of concern and Camilla and the others go on the defensive. Caleb steps between them."Whoa whoa, wait a-""YOU be silent! I'm getting to you soon!", HP Madeline stated cutting him off. Caleb stops Lyca and Camilla from jumping in and reluctantly let's her continue berating Mirabelle understanding these are family matters, "Do you have ANY idea how worried I have been?! Almost TWO MONTHS I hear NOTHING from you of how your mission is proceeding!""I know! I-I'm sorry Mother! I-I just been...busy.", Mirabelle spoke in a low, shameful tone."Too busy?! With what?! You couldn't ONCE inform me of your status?! You have five perfectly good dreamscape right here!", HP Madeline stated gesturing a the Caleb and group each wearing looks that said 'Wait, what?' before she continues,"I actually tried reaching out to your astral form. Every time I tried there was always obstruction. As if the connection was being cut every time! It was your doing, wasn't it?", HP Madeline says her in a sour tone as Mirabelle couldn't conjure a reply her demeanor already answering for her, " So this whole FUCKING time I could not reach you ! You could've been DEAD for all I knew!"Mirabelle flinches looking down in shame as Caleb and the others wanted to take her defense. Yet, to some extent, they understand where her mother's grievance was coming from know it to be unwise to step between a mother disciplining her child."I-I'm so, so sorry, mother! I...", Mirabelle gulps placing her hand to her chest and lowly spoke, "It's true. I...I was severing the connection whenever you attempted to appears in the dreamscape."Caleb along with Lyca look to noticing her downtrodden and shameful expression while Emmeryne and the other retainers were utterly flabbergasted by what they heard. HP Madeline's expression turns dark with shadow appearing to cover her eyes. Caleb felt a chill run down his spine."Oh no, I know that look anywhere.", Ein whispered to Camilla, "Our mother's always had it when they just done with our crap.""I understand what ju mean. This is...going to be hard to watch.", Camilla whispered back becoming more worried for Mirabelle.HP Madeline takes a deep breath, "You know what? I am not even surprised. You have always been this way. Whether it be...sherking your training or obsessing over that...ahnimay Sailor scout moon nonsense!""It's NOT nonsense-""SILENCE!", HP Madeline cuts her off startling her daughter and her retainers. Her mother massages her forehead, "I thought, perhaps, allowing you to come to this country and participate in this...exchange program farce, you would accomplish at least one of your duties as the future High Priestess of the Crescent Moon clan."Mirabelle doesn't respond only looking more dejected by the second."Uh, Ms. High Priestess ma'am?", Caleb spoke getting her attention as she turns to him, "You keep mentioning her 'mission'. What exactly was it?""Dear, no, wait-""Oh hush!", Madeline stated as Mirabelle obediently goes quiet much to Camilla and Lyca chagrin, "I was just getting to that. Her mission...was to find you."Caleb along with Lyca and the rest were taken aback by her answer. He looks to Mirabelle her looks at him with pleading eyes."Me? Why me?", Caleb inquired"Well, to be more accurate, someone LIKE you.", Madeline started making Caleb and the other look to more confused, "One of a High Priestess' important duties is securing the family bloodline once she has reached her 20th cycle. This means finding an acceptable male, mating with them, and conceiving the next High Priestess after her. Typically, the only males we select are the Centaur belonging to clans in our neighboring territory but, on rare occasions, we breed with humans.""So then...why did you send Mira away from her home?", Lyca inquires earning a cold look from the Madeline."Well, young Kobold, my daughter was so unsuccessful in her endeavors to seduce a decent partner that I had no choice. I blame it on her extremely arbitrary standards. None of them were ever good enough. I thought by now she would have taken this one's seed and have returned home by now", Madeline spoke looking to Caleb as he takes a moment to process what he heard."Of course not!", Mirabelle spoke abruptly turning to Caleb, "I could never do that with someone I wasn't even in love with!"Caleb looks to her seeing the desperation for him to believe her in her face. He did, he knew in his heart her words were true."It's not about what you FEEL for them!", Madeline stated firmly putting Mirabelle back on edge, " All that matters is securing the bloodline! By now, you could gotten what you needed and be done with him!"No! I couldn't do that to him!", Mirabelle stated defensively. Caleb does his best restrain himself from jumping in. Ein and the others appeared deeply conflicted right now as well."I suppose not. Instead you would rather bestow upon him, a human, our clan's sacred mark!", Madeline says sounding irritated.Caleb is taken aback a moment quickly realizing what she meant."Wait...do you mean...this mark she gave me the day after we met?", Caleb says pulling back his shirt collar showing the deep purplish-black hoof mark with a lighter shade crescent moon in the center. Madeline retainers give stunned looks whispering to each other."Are you-?!", Madeline deeply inhales and exhales massaging her temple then looking to Mirabelle, "Did he say that you bestowed...our clans mark...to someone you JUST met? Are you serious? Have you gone mad?!""Well...I...I just knew I could trust him...so...", Mirabelle trails touching her fingers as her mother and her retainer stare at her incredulously."Ok, I'm pretty lost here. Mind telling me what all this means?", Caleb spoke up."Haaa, basically, when my daughter RECKLESSLY...", she emphasizes looking right at Mirabelle who looks down in shame, "bestowed our clans mark to you, she automatically made you a member of the family; something she had no right to do since she is NOT the High Priestess yet.""Wait, what? Moon pie, is she serious?", Caleb spoke in disbelief as Camilla and the others turn to her curiously."T-Technically, yes, but...I could just sensed there was something about you I liked! Something I never encountered before! So I...", Mirabelle tried to justify feeling her words falling flat. Caleb gave her a questioning look."You decided to bind him to you, so you wouldn't lose him.", Madeline pointed out catching Caleb and the other's attention."What do you mean 'bind me'?", he inquired glancing to Mirabelle suspiciously."When she bestowed it to you what she didn't know by doing so binds your dreamscape to her astral form.", Madeline explains"Why is that mark so significant anyway? Isn't it just to identify members or whatever?", Zwei inquires."It's a bit more complex than that. It's similar to the marks that identify higher ranking members like my Retainers.", Madeline says as Emmeryne and the others exposed heir left should revealing a very different variant of Caleb's mark, "However, the mark he has allows him to draw the power of the High Priestess from her dreamscape through the link between them. Over time the link has gotten stronger.""She first noticed it a couple months ago. The astral energy of a new clan member appeared out of nowhere. It was faint and weak at first but overtime it grew more and more intense.", Elaine added."At one point, two astral signatures, one of them Lady Mirabelle's, appear putting out a tremendous amount of energy. The new signature was also filled with intense...violent rage and malice! For High Priestess safety, we kept our distance.", Freya explained looking at Caleb with slight scrutiny.Matilda jumps in now, "Until very recently, she sensed two strong astal energy signatures suddenly spiked to their most intense level yet. It was strong enough to rival the High Priestess herself! It even revealed Lady Mirabelle's location!""At that point, we simply had to come here and assess things ourselves. Perhaps finally be reunited with Lady Mirabelle!", Emmeryne spoke with a small grin, "We each pooled our energy for the High Priestess to teleport us here!"Caleb and the others look to her curiously before Camilla speaks up"Pardomeme, ju all keep saying say 'astral energy'. Is that what your people call your mystic arts tied to control of mana?", the she-devil questioned."Not exactly, though in many ways it is similar to mystical energy used by beings like yourself. In many Asian countries, we found there beings that call it 'ki or chakra'. To each there own.", Emmeryne explained shrugging with a grin."She's right. That what we always called it.", Zwei emphasized generating a small rotating ball of pressurized air before Ein nudges her making her notice Madeline glaring at her impatiently. Zwei quickly dissipates the ball, "Ahem, sorry."" Now, I see my suspicions are confirmed about you, Mr. Bizzell .", Madeline continued catching Caleb's attention, "You and my daughter share an incredibly powerful link. I believe even my dream scythe would have difficulty severing it.""Her dream wha?", Lyca whispered to Zwei."I don't know. Might be a them thing.", the weasel shrugged."When I was in your dreamscape, I could feel the great power you possess. I could barely hold control over your psyche when you were backed in a corner. And I see it's just as capable utilizing these powers in the physical world. You are essentially a male High Priestess; a living contradiction.", Madeline says before her voice turns colder, "and that makes you very dangerous."Caleb along with Mirabelle and the other girls look to her in confusion."What? Dangerous? Why?", Caleb spoke incredulously"No human should EVER have this kind of knowledge of our abilities! I let my daughter join the cultural exchange program under the condition she NEVER let the humans gain true knowledge of our capabilities! And what does she do? Sully our family pride and, worst of all, allowing the humans of this ludicrous program access to our precious secrets through some Agent Sterling bloke", Madeline stated irately as her retainers looked at her with concern."Wha-how did you-", Caleb started before Madeline cuts in"Through your dreamscape you fool!", she insulted causing Camilla to glare menacingly at her digging her claws into the couch fibers. Ein pats her shoulder to calm her down and hold her back."Don't call him that!", Mirabelle stated, "He was only doing his job as my caretaker! The information shared to Sterling is very confidential. He would never allow it to circulate publicly without my consent! He's doing so much to protect our image from the public. Besides, it's not ICEP intent to exploit us. They only want to know more about our people and eventually come to accept us and-""Are you DAFT girl?! Do you really think we should put my faith that? It doesn't matter if you trust a handful of people. If even ONE has malicous intent, it would be disastrous! And there's this one!", Madeline stated pointing to Caleb, "His access to your abilities poses a risk of exposing us! You can to deny it and say you'll 'be careful" but what if he is captured and forced to tell what he knows? What if he loses control just like earlier in front of other people? ...Or has he already? Worst of all, I learned through his dreamscape the he is the target of a criminal organizations that EXPLOITS non-humans for their abilities. What if THEY find and capture or learn of my DAUGHTER!?"Caleb and Mirabelle pause unable to say something in their defense as they think back on their experiences the last couple weeks. They along with Ein and the others feel dread creep through their senses unable to deny Madelines accusations."Heh, your reactions tell the whole story. Do either of you SEE how much you are putting ours and our sister clan's safety in jeopardy?! We've lived relatively peaceful out of the line of sight of those that despise our existence. I refuse to allow anything or anyone destroy that.", Madeline spoke coldly with hints of saddeness in her voice. Her retainers wore crestfallen expressions as if ruminating on her words. Mirabelle kept her head low in shame fighting back her tears."So...what now?", Caleb spoke getting Madeline attention, "Where do you want to go from here?"Madeline gives him a cold look, "Well, first, I am going to do everything in my power to sever the astral link between you and my daughter. You'll lose her power and return to being a normal human. After that, my daughter shall withdraw from the exchange program and return home immediately. It's for the best."The room fell silent as Caleb, Camilla, Lyca and the Zyklons are taken aback in profound shock at the idea of losing Mirabelle. Mirabelle herself wore an utterly devastated expression as if her heart had just been broken in half. Madeline retainers look to their High Priestess then see the look on Lady Mirabelle face. Their hearts hurt for her but they couldn't deny Madelines logic and knew she's only thinking of her clan's safety. They were conflicted but their duty as retainers had to come first.Caleb stood in thought slowly coming to the realization of just how much Matilda said is true."YOU CAN'T BE SEROUS!", "QUE MIERDA(WHAT THE FUCK)!?", "Are you kidding, lady!?", "You can't be serious?!", Lyca, Camilla, Zwei, and Ein hop up shouting simultaneously startling Madeline and her retainers flinch. Mirabelle remains silent looking downwards in thought with her purple hair obscuring her face.Caleb is also taken aback before Lyca rushes to Mirabelle side."NO WAY IN HELL YOU'RE TAKIN' MIRA!", Lyca snarled bearing her fangs at Matilda and her retainers, "Even if you're her mom, I going with you means we lose a member of our family forever, then I refuse!"Matilda and her retainers are surprised before Camilla also steps up."That is right! She is not going anywhere!", Camilla stated glaring at Madeline, "I understand your concerns as a woman...as a mother...but this CANNOT stand! If ju want her, my have to go through me!"Madeline is taken aback before she and Camilla lock eyes intensely." ! Ms. Sartana! That's enough!", Ein stated getting between the two groups, "Apologies, she...didn't mean that. What she meant was, you need not worry because your daughter is in good hands. My sisters and I highly trained MON special agents with several operations under our belt.""Humans? Liminals? There's nobody we can't handle. Heck, ask these two. They know what we're talking about.", Zwei said pointing to Emmeryne and Elaine. Both Nightmare tense up recounting their first encounter with the weasels and looking away in embarrassment. Ein gives her an annoyed look and Zwei backpeddles, "Ahem, no offense! You guys are still great."Madeline ignores her comment, "I appreciate your resolve but I've already decided long before arriving. I am taking my daughter home today and that's final. If you insist on stopping me...I will not hold back.", she emphasizes as purple aura flares momentarily around her body along with her retainer glaring intently at Lyca and Camilla.Lyca lower her ears and emits a low growl while Camilla generates two small magic seals in her palms. Ein, Zwei, and especially Caleb could sense the growing hostility in the atmosphere unsure of how to settle the group's down. Until..."No.", Mirabelle uttered catching everyone's attention. Her head was still lowered."What was that?", Madeline spoke as her retainers look to Mirabelle a sinking feeling in their stomachs."I SAID 'NO', MUMMY!", Mirabelle shouted raising her head showing her tear stained face catching everyone off guard, "I'M NOT GOING WITH YOU! I'M STAYING HERE...WITH CALEB AND EVERYONE!"Lyca and Camilla step back giving her a little space as the Zyklons, Madeline and her retainers, and Caleb stare at her mouths slightly agape. Caleb feels the side of his chest throbbing as a aching feeling of sadness spreads through his being."Do not use that tone with me! I am your MOTHER! I am only doing what is best for YOU!", Madeline stated asserting her authority as Lyca and Camilla step away letting the two have at it. Emmeryne and the other retainers give concerned glances to each other."That is NOT what is best for me!", Mirabelle stated her voice slightly cracking."And what? Staying here is?! As long as you are with his man you are in constant danger! If not gangsters or assassins, then humans that'll harass you on your appearance alone! You are MUCH better off in the safety of our clan!", Madeline affirms"Safety?! Closing ourselves off from the rest of the world, living in the shadows as if we don't exist at all?! To simply OBSERVE societies changing around us but NEVER be a part of them?! That's not safety that living in FEAR mummy!", Mirabelle stated as her mothers eyes widen, "Gods, I spent HALF OF MY LIFE in our clans villages! All I knew about modern technology, humans, and other Centaur was from what others told me or brought back as souvenir! I-I didn't even know what ICE CREAM was until I FIFTEEN!"Emmeryne shyly grins rubbing the back of her head and the other retainers look to her judgingly."The first dreamscape I ever entered, I saw so many things. So much outside of our villages! I wanted more! So...I kept lying to get new male candidates!", Mirabelle said which surprised to her mother and her retainers, "Anime, video games, human cities and cultures, foods, Sailor Moon? I wanted to experience it all myself with my own two hands!""Is THAT why you kept failing your missions? Because you were sidetracked?!", Madeline stated in disbelief."You're missing the point! All you've and every other clan has ever told me was that the world was cruel and full of enemies that hate our people! That it was a terrifying place! You were lying to me! Why?!", Mirabelle demanded."W-We were PROTECTING you! You and the other High Priestess candidates in our sister clans!", Madeline insisted"Well I didn't protecting! I needed FREEDOM!", Mirabelle stated heartily, "Living with Dear has been the best experience of my life because, for once, I'm not afraid. I'm not alone. I'm safe! I feel loved in ways I never thought I COULD be loved!"Caleb eyes widen feeling an intense warmth spread from the area of the mark throughout his body."Love? I-Is THAT what I just witnessed earlier?!", Madeline questions her breathing unsteady and putting Caleb, Mirabelle, and the others on guard, "Well you have a right bloody warped version of it!""Y-Y-You got it all wrong! That was-", Mirabelle tries to explain but was interrupted."I know EXACTLY what it was, I got everything I needed when I entered his dreamscape. My own daughter...embroiled in some...THREE TIMING perverse relationship! Is this the FREEDOM you desire?! To be this degenerate's MISTRESS along with these two other trollops?! Disgusting!", Madeline stated in revulsion as Caleb and Mirabelle jaws drop in shock."Oh HELL NO!", Camilla stated raising to her feet startling Madeline while her retainers prepare to defend her. Camilla was about to confront her when Ein blocks her path."Ms. Sartana, stop, wait!""Get out of the way! Who does this perra (bitch) think she is?! How dare shejudge our relationship with Señor?! I don't care if she is Señora mother, I will snap YOU in half!", Camilla stated glaring daggers at Madeline making her flinch."That's right!", Lyca joined, "Nobody badmouths out pack no matter who they are!", Lyca stated glaring right at Madeline as Zwei steps in to hold her back."Enough! Both of you!", Caleb stated getting between the two groups."But Señor she-", "But Chief she-""I know girls! But let me handle this, alright?", Caleb said as the two liminal reluctantly back down. He then turns and faces Madeline, "Ok, ma'am, yes it's true we have a...unique relationship but it's not what you think! I love your daughter just as much as I love Camilla and Lyca!""It's true mummy! He loves us all equally and he tries his best to make us happy!", Mirabelle spoke as her mother gives her a surprise." *snort* ha...haha...ahahahaha are you serious?", Madeline chuckled unconvincingly to Caleb and Mirabelle surprise, "You expect me to believe that lie for a second? And the worst part is, you actually DO believe in it, don't you?"Mirabelle pauses."Oh my word, he's deceiving you, you naive little girl! He's just using you to get what he wants. Wake up and stop behaving like a child clinging to her toy and realize that before you get hurt! And it WILL hurt tremendously!", Madeline says as she clutches her chestMirabelle looks to her mother with shock, "W-Why would say that?""Ma'am, I'm sorry but that is going over the line now!", Caleb stated as Madeline retainers eye him cautiously, "Now I love Moon pie I'm IN love with her along with her. And nothing will ever change that!""Oh? Are you sure? Then let me tell you what your precious "Moon pie" would have done if she had carried out her mission.", Madeline says as Mirabelle eyes widen in horror."Mummy, no, sto-""Hush child! He may as well know at this point.", Madeline chastised before facing Caleb."Know...what?", Caleb inquires."Nothing Dear, it's-""QUIET! ", Madeline cuts Mirabelle off again, "I mentioned earlier that when our a species reaches our 20th cycle, she is find a suitable male and mate with him. Do you know why that is?""No, not really.", Caleb answered"Well, it's because we are only able to give birth between the ages of 20 and 35.", Madeline says to the surprise of Caleb and the rest save for Mirabelle, "You see, Onieori, the progenitor of the Nightmare race recieved the blessings of the Goddess Nyx for the power to rule the darkness and all metaphysical planes. In exchange for this power, our fertility changed drastically. Not only with out fertility cycles but we are only able to give birth to females of our race. There's no such thing as a MALE Nightmare.""Ok, I'm following you so far.""That means we must breed with males of our Chironian counterparts or, if necessary, humans. Unfortunately, these Centaur despise and revile all 'Children of Onieori' as cursed, wicked heathens while humans call us demons. Yet, we still have to keep out race alive so we select a male that strikes our fancy-""Mummy, please!", Mirabelle pleaded"Hush! And we invade his dreams while he slumbers. In it, we take the appearance of what their ideal mate based on information gathered from frequently visiting his dreamscape. We then proceed to seduce him.", Madeline explained as Caleb suddenly thinks back to the dream he had the night Mirabelle came to live with him. Madeline's tone grows more doleful, "If he's receptive, we then uses his weakened psyche to gain control of his body in the real world!"Caleb eyes widen looking to Mirabelle who wears a horrified and sorrowful expression shaking he head to him."Mother!""And we forced them to sleepwalk to where our physical bodies are present...and...we force them to assault us!", Madeline forces out feeling a lump in her throat. Her Retainers look to her shocked at her admittance to their shameful method of breeding. Their hearts also sink upon seeing Lady Mirabelle with tears streaming down Mirabelle face in utter devastation. It hurt but they remain resolute at the High Priestess side. Madeline herself falls silent a moment noticing the shocked expression of Caleb and his girls realizing what she just done."Moon pie...", Caleb spoke clearing a lump in his throat as Mirabelle could barely force herself to look at him, "Is what your mother says true?"His tone was not of anger, nor disgust, nor fear, but one of expectation."...yes.", Mirabelle reluctantly answers in a whisper as Camilla and the other look to her with mixed expressions. She looks to him with desperate eyes.Caleb goes silent not able to find words to express the emotions richocheting in his mind. He then walks up to her and kneels down until they were at eye level. Mirabelle whimpers afraid of what was to come next as she looked to be about to sob even harder."Ok.", Caleb utters taking her hand gently as Mirabelle and everyone else looks to him in surprise."What?", Mirabelle spoke in disbelief."It's ok, Moon pie.", Caleb spoke caressing both sides of her face wiping her tears away with his thumbs. Mirabelle eyes twinkling hopefully his big, strong but kind hands."I would NEVER hurt you! *Hic* The day I first...entered your dreams, I knew you were different. I-I knew...I couldn't do that to you...and j-just leave you. *sniffle hic* I wanted to stay...because...because I had found the man of my dreams.", Mirabelle whimpered staring devotedly at him, "I love you.""I love you too, it's ok.", Caleb says standing up hugging her head to his stomach petting her head as she whimpered into his shirt. Camilla, Lyca, and the Zyklons watch them unable to help smilingMadeline and her retainers watch the scene flabbergasted." 'Ok'?", Madeline uttered in disbelief, "How is it OK? What we do it's...it's...and you say it's OK? What's wrong with you?"Caleb looks to her with a stern glare before standing up patting Mirabelle head as strongly, "What's wrong with you? If you really cared for your daughter as you claim you wouldn't torture her like this just to get your way!"Mirabelle and the others observe the two of them as Madeline clutches her cloak tightly in her fingers."How dare you? Who...who are YOU to speak to me that way? You think I'm doing this for my own interests?! I'm trying to save her. I'm trying to save her from the pain...that loving someone like you brings! You're not a mother. What do YOU know?", Madeline spoke quivering with anger and sadness, "Do you know how YOUR mother if the roles were reversed? How would she react to your polygamist relationship with these and MY daughter?!"Mirabelle along with Zwei's eyes widen knowing a landmine had just been triggered."What?", Caleb says in a deep tone glaring as his mark glows and purple take on a menacing purple tint, "What the fuck did you just say?"Madeline and her retainers immediately sense a powerful force rising within the young man."Eso es( That's it)! I have had ENOUGH of this-", Camilla stated raising only for Zwei to grab her arm pulling her back. She shakes her head advising the Elder Devil to stay out of it. Camilla looks to Caleb again as she and everyone else look to him in shock as his body is enveloped in shimmering purple aura and a purple mist begins to waft from his ankles. The mark on his chest burns brightly spewing purple flames which soon began to flicker from Caleb's fingertips."Nightmare Caleb...", Lyca uttered softly in amazement as the Zyklons and Camilla look to her to back to Caleb."I'll as again. What. The fuck. Did you say.", Caleb spoke his voice becoming slightly distorted and filled with anger and glaring intensely at Madeline.The Nightmare and her retainers recoil fearfully sensing the threatening levels of astral energy he was outputting at once. Madeline stood to much to her retainers surprise until they follow her lead. The high preistess meets him at eye level as her aura flares up as well surrounding her entire body. Her retainers knew she was getting serious and prepared protect her."D-Dear, please-", Mirabelle attempts speak before her mom jumps in."D-Do you think y-you scare me?!", Madeline shakily spoke visibly trembling as she scowl at him , "Y-Y-You thinking standing there trying to intimidate me with power that not really yours will make me back down?! Well I won't! Never! Men like you...always use...", Madeline voice cracks a bit as tears begin to form in the corners of her eyes. Caleb angry demeanor softens a bit noticing the familiar pain in her voice."Please stop! Both of you!", Mirabelle pleaded as Caleb looks at her a moment before noticing Madeline aura flaring more intensely."That's right! This is getting out of h-", Ein attempted to pull Calen when..."ENOUGH OF THIS!", Madeline bellowed before a pulse of purple aura rips from her body covering everyone and everything within a twenty foot radius in glowing purple energy.Caleb stood feeling his entire body going stiff as wood. The most her could do was turn his head. He was shocked when he noticed that Camilla, Lyca, and the Zyklons sat motionless staring unblinkingly in a sort of daze. He sees Mirabelle was in a similar position as him; conscious but unable to move."Enough.", Madeline spoke coldly as she approached Caleb with her retainers raising up as well, "We are severing the astral link...and then...my daughter shall return home. That...is final.""...Understood!", her retainers reluctantly agreed in unison after noticing the pained look on Mirabelle face."No! Mummy, you can't!", Mirabelle begged as Emmeryne and Elaing goto console her."We're so sorry, Lady Mirabelle.", Emmeryne spoke sadly."Forgive us, but we must do this.", Elaine added not able to look Mirabelle in the eye."No...", Mirabelle whimpered sadly.Madeline stands facing Caleb then reaches her hand up placing it to his forehead. Her eyes glowing with blinding purple as Caleb starts to fall into a daze. Matilda and Freya place their hands to her and their eyes take on a similar glow.Caleb became drowsy as he struggled to stay conscious. He stares at Madeline's blank glowy-eyed face the looks to Mirabelle. The pure despair on her face coupled with the thought of losing her. The woman he poured his soul out for gave his heart to and who warmly accepted it and more. At that moment, something arose in Caleb and the only one thing ran through his head.'NO!', he screamed internally as purple flamelike aura covers his entire body surprising Madeline and the others. Using all his willpower, he forces his right arm to move. He glares at Madeline with burning purple wisps in his eyes the immediately grabs her clutching her head. Her retainers gasp in horror.Madeline feels her senses becoming overtaken, her body starting to feeling heavy as stone as her mind falls...Dreamscape...Caleb's rubs his eyes feeling a slight headache before they widen getting a look at his surroundings realizing he was in the dreamscape but noticed it was quite different from his own. Instead of a realm of purple light and mist, this was a solid white blank realm lined with what appeared to be water color paintings. He walked around feeling he was being guided by some unknown force. He came upon a painting surprised to see it was of, who appeared to be Mirabelle but with longer hair standing in the foreground. It was then he realizes it was her mother in her 20s! She wore a melancholic expression with her hands clasped together in prayer. The was a white broken heart shape in her chest. He then notices the title of the painting engraving at the bottom, 'False Attraction'.The painting ripples like water beckoning Caleb to touch it. Instantly, Caleb is feels a rush of memories flooding his vision jusr like with Camilla.He sees flashes of Madeline's days leading up to when HER mother was preparing to pass the torch of Preistesshood on to her. As per their...tradition, Madeline was tasked with seducing and procreating with one of the male Centaur from a clan in Rome. Caleb learns she searched for a 3 days only coming across, in her opinion, rather unappealing males; many were boorish and vulgar muscleheads. That was until she met...him, Octavian Lambos. A unique specimen as he was one of a handful of males that behaved with the refine etiquette of a truly honorable knight. He was a tall, handsome golden brown stallion with chiseled muscles and a sexy masculine voice. Naturally, he had plenty of female admirers for his superb jousting abilities, suave personality, and the fact he was next in line to inherit the clan estate. Nonetheless, It was love at first sight.She began invading his dreams, learning more and more him, while appearing as his supposed ideal mate. She took control of his body one knight guiding him to a secluded area in his estates courtyard where she had been waiting. Right before he could mount her, she broke her control over him deciding she do this to her first love. He reacted with shock at first but, to her surprise, he wasn't repulsed by the fact she was Nightmare. After that, the two began a secret romance keeping out of the watchful eyes of the other Centaur in the clan. He was always kind to Madeline despite his family's hatred of her kind and showed levels of intimacy she had never experienced. He told her she was special to him. She eventually became pregnant with his child and ecstatic by the news even reporting back to her mother about her success. However, she didn't tell her she wanted stay and raise the child in secret with her new lover. At the same time though, Octavian's clan soon became aware of his sudden disappearances at night.One night, Madeline was eagerly awaiting to tell Octavian the good news. What she didn't expect were several members of his clan to discover them together being intimate. They were absolutely appalled and disgusted. Three of the female knights forcefully dragged Madeline out by the hair holding her captive with swords. They accused her of seducing the young Lord with her 'wicked magic' to which Madeline pleaded for them to listen to her. She turned to Octavius believing he come to her rescue. Instead, he acted just as repulsed and even horrified at what she been "forcing" him to do, much to Madeline's shock and profound hurt. Octavian father insisted they execute her immediately. Madeline tearfully begs to be spared even cries out that she was pregnant with his son's child.They, especially Octavian, were shocked and even more disgusted. Then one of the knights, a tall F-cup Centaur woman with long platinum blonde hair approaches her with hatred in her gaze before slapping Madeline hard to the ground. She berates her for seducing her recently proposed fiance much to Madeline horror. Octavian approaches his "fiance" assuring her everything would be ok and they would "take care of the heathen and the abomination inside her."Octavian leans and whispered in Madeline's ear, "It was fun while it lasted.". At that moment, her heart shattered realizing he had just been using her the entire time. Two female Centaur hoisted her to her feet as Octavian enraged father decided that killing was too soft. She needed to be humiliated like she humiliated his family which the other males happily agreed. As they all close in on Madeline, she let's out and anguished scream sending a powerful shockwave of purple aura ripling through Octavian and the others. All the Centaur collapse to the ground unconcious as Madeline teleports away. Madeline reappears far from the estate in a forest sobbing violently. The scene transition to where she returns home, tells her mother the truth, and was scolded at first before being comforted by her and her retainers. Madeline later made a vow, that she would protect her child no matter. She would give this child TWICE the love in place of her so-called father. She would never let her child be blinded by desire...like her.Caleb feels a hand grabs his shoulder tugging him backwards out of the scene. He gasps for air feeling like he had been submerged underwater. He then sees Madeline, in present day , standing over him among the portraits."How dare you?", she asks in anger and saddness, "You had NO RIGHT to see that!"Caleb stands up giving her a sympathetic look, "I...didn't mean to. I just...I-I can't believe that happened to you.""Well believe it! It's in the past so don't you DARE pity me!", Madeline berated him before looking away at one of the paintings of her and 3-year-old Mirabelle laughing together, "It not like it really matters noe anyway.""Clearly it does. Is...is that what you're afraid I'll do to Mirabelle?", Caleb inquires in a serious tone as Madeline remains silent already confirming the answer, "Ms. Marequine, I would NEVER do something as cruel and dishonest as what that asshole did to her. You've seen inside my head, look again if you want! Come on. Do I really seem like the kind of man who would hurt her intentionally?"Madeline doesn't look at him only remaining silent before sadly answering, "That's what I believed at first. I let love blind me from finding the truth. I can see my daughter is the same as me at that age. Neither of us had experienced HOW cruel people from outside our domain could be. She's young too, she hasn't experienced what it's like to be in love and then betrayed!""You're wrong, mummy!..", came the voice of Mirabelle.Caleb and Madeline turn in the direction it came from surprised to see, not just her, but Freya and Matilda at her side waving sheepishly."Moon pie? What are you...HOW are you in here right now...with those two?", Caleb inquired."When saw your astral body enter my mum's dreamscape, I just had to follow you. Emmeryne and Elaine tried to stop me but they know a single dreamscape can only handle so astral bodies at once.", Mirabelle explained as she walks up to them looking around at the paintings, "hmm, it has been awhile since I was in your dreamscape, mummy. You keep it as tidy as ever."Madeline shifts her gaze reminiscently before responding, "I suppose. Now, tell me, what do you mean by that?""I...I believe it's better if I show you.", Mirabelle say offering her open palm to her mother. Madeline gives her and inquisitive look then reluctantly reaches and clasps her hand to her daughters. The two Nightmare entire bodies glow brightly while rippling and distorting like tv static. Caleb goes to them out of concern but Matilda and Freya stop him."It's ok young man, this is perfectly normal.", Freya spoke assuringly.Madeline is bombarded with images and scenes of Mirabelle time some coming to the United States and joining ICEP. The fear, uncertainty, and disillusionment upon being rejected many times by potential hosts because of her appearance. The hosts who DID take her in, later she found out their bad intentions toward her and forced them to kick her out while confessing said intentions. Then she showed her memories of her...and Jason. How well things started out before he gradually began emotionally and sexually abusing her. The shame, fear, pain, and disgust she felt everyday up until he was finally caught by Sterling.Madeline was understandably shocked and saddened by her daughters past trauma but then is bombarded with memories of Caleb, Lyca and the others. Every laugh or cry they shared, every time Caleb made her feel safe, loved, and appreciated. The doubts and insecurities she had that soon replaced with trust by his comforting warmth and support. Lyca and Camilla, once her rivals, now are like surrogate sisters. Even the danger she felt, be it the Fourth of July weekend, the encounter with Malone/Fallen Angel, or just strangers that whispered words disdain or malice, served as reminder of what their loved has survived so far and will continue to.Mirabelle releases her mother's hand as their bodies return to normal. Madeline looks to her daughter in utter disbelief"Mirabelle...I...I...", Madeline struggled to find the right words to describe what she felt at the moment."Mummy...it's ok, I know.", Mirabelle spoke understandingly, "You just didn't want me to suffer...as much as you have...because of...father."Madeline eyes widen in shock as Caleb looks surprised as well."Y-You saw everything?", Madeline asks in fear."I...only saw fragments when I entered.", Mirabelle answered, "So that is why you never wanted to talk about him. To think...I came from such a despicable man. However, I don't regret my birth!"Madeline, Caleb and the retainers look to her surprised."I am YOUR daughter, not his. I was loved and raised by you and my clan. I know you were just trying to protect me from the pain you experienced. However...", Mirabelle trails touching her palm to her heart, "the pain I experienced has led my heart to the happiness I now everyday I'm with Caleb! I refuse to hide and be afraid...because...I found someone just like me that I can face the world with!", she stated proudly as Caleb smiles going to her side."I couldn't agree more, Moon pie.", Caleb affirms taking her hand the two interlocking her finger to his. Madeline and the two retainers see the pair smile adoringly at each other. Caleb turn to Madeline."Ms. Marequine, it's ok if you sever the...astral...bond or whatever between Moon pie and me.", he said surprising everyone especially Madeline."But Dear-", Mirabelle started but Caleb hushes her with a gently finger to the lips."No baby, it's fine.", Caleb affirms looking to Madeline again, "I want to protect her too. If you believe me having access to her powers endangers her, then I don't need them. All I ask...is you please let her stay."Mirabelle heart flutters upon hearing his words and Madeline and her retainers were also taken aback by his selflessness.Madeline stares at him sadly, "You truly love her...don't you. You're not lying. You're in love with her.""Yes ma'am. But not JUST her.", Caleb answers, "Lyca and Camilla reside in my heart as well. I myself struggled to allow myself to let them in or even admit that love. I learned that the heart is complicated and can hold more people than we realize. This whole...four person relationship is still new to me...and your daughter...but everyday we figure it out with the others. It just...works."Madelines gives a shocked look before Matilda jumps in."H-He is telling the truth High Priestess. I entered the dreamscape of that Werewolf girl earlier and I saw she was quite happy and deeply in love with this young man.""I entered the Demoness dreamscape and...she was had similar feelings toward him.", Freya added.Tears began to flow down Madeline's cheeks, "And I wanted to take my daughter away from someone like you. *sob* I truly am wicked. I'm so sorry, darling. Please don't hate me!", she anguishes collapsing to her knees to her retainers concern."Mummy, no!", Mirabelle goes and hugs her mother to her surprise, "I could NEVER hate you! Because...You're are my one and only mummy!"Madeline looks into her daughters eye with a small grin and hummed back, "And you're my one and only daughter""And together we'reeee...""TWO CHEEKY PURPLE BUGGERS!", Mirabelle and her mother exclaimed at the same time pointing at each other with toothy grins before chuckling lovingly.Caleb smiled warmly at the two of them before noticing Freya and Matilda approach both equally delighted at the scene."Huhuhu, they certainly haven't done that in a quite some time.", Matilda giggled reminiscing fondly."Not since Lady Mirabelle was much younger at least.", Freya added in a warm tone remembering Mirabelle as a little mare.Mirabelle and Madeline finish their mother-daughter embrace before standing to their feet. Madeline caresses her daughter's cheek lovingly."I was wrong. You've grown so much more than I realized.", Madeline spoke sweetly before looking to Caleb, "And I have you to thank for that."Caleb rubs the back of his head sheepishly, "Yeahhhh, but really no. It was mostly her choice to change. The best I can do is be good company.""Sometimes, that more than enough. I thank you as well Mr. Bizzell.", Matilda spoke in appreciation."As do I. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.", Freya added giving a warm smile.Caleb blushes in embarassment, "Hey, come on now! It's not that big a de-Oh, right! What about the link and this mark? You guys can remove it now if you want. We got time...literally. Time moves like wayyy different in here."Madeline pauses a moment in thought, "No. I don't believe it's necessary."Everyone looks to her in surprise but before they could question her further the world around them begins to flicker and distort. Even the paintings around them begin to glitch out. They look to Madeline who appears to be breathing laboriously prompting her retainers to go to her side,"High Priestess!", both Matilda and Freya stated supporting her on both sides."Mummy?!", Mirabelle exclaims"Are you ok?! What's happening to this place?", Caleb stated"I-I'm fine. I'm just not used to having this many astral bodies in my dreamscape at once.", Madeline answered forcing a smile, "Can we finish this conversation out there?""Yeah, of course!", Caleb agreed before realizing he had no idea how to leave, "Uhh, how do I-AH SHIT! HERE WE GO!", he exclaimed as his body goes flying backward at high velocity as every thing goes black....Dreamscape end..."ohhh, are you sure we can't go in? They've all been in her there a long time.", Emmeryne bemoaned unable to stop pacing around the couch looking to Caleb, Mirabelle, and the other two retainers frozen in a trance."Stop pacing so much! You making me nervous! Besides, it's only been seven minutes. We'll wait as long as we need to.", Elaine stated."What about them?", Emmeryne says looking to Camilla and the others still frozen in a trance."I'm sure she will release them. Still...I didn't expect this man to jump into her dreamscape so suddenly and easily.", Elaine said looking to Caleb, "Maybe the High Priestess was right about him being dangero-""HAAHH!", Caleb gasps his consciousness instantly returning"AHHHH!", Elaine screamed from being startled.Mirabelle, Madeline, and the other two retainers quickly regain consciousness as well."Hoooo that's better.", Madeline sighed as she and the other readjust their senses."You're back! What happened!? What did he do?! Are you all ok?!", Emmeryne worriedly inquired."Everything is fine! There's no need to worry.", Madeline stated firmly but calm. She looks to Caleb who nods. She puts her hands together and a purple sphere forms and she releases a pulse of energy at Camilla and the rest. They each instantly regain consciousness glancing around in befuddlement."Uhhh...anyone else feel like they just sat through the world's longest, boringest history lecture?", Zwei inquired."Ugh, something like that. All I remember is seeing this purple flash and...", Ein says rubbing her head as realization hits her and the others.Camilla immediately raises up glaring at Madeline, "Tu perra(You bitch), what du ju-?!""I APOLOGIZE!", Madeline stated sincerely much to Camilla's and the others, including Emmeryne and Elaine's, surprise, "I was wrong about Mr. Bizzell, on all accounts. I see now that he has no ill intentions toward my daughter. Furthermore, I treated you all with such flagrant disrespect without knowing the full story. I am truly sorry. Please, forgive me.", she finished bowing her head placing her hand over her heart.Camilla and the others pause unsure how to respond. They look to Caleb questioning just what the hell was happening right now."It's alright girls. Moon pie and I explained everything much more clearly.", Caleb says."When?!", Ein inquired.Caleb explained what happened, leaving out private details of Madeline's past, as the girls look to him silently processing the information."Ohhh that makes sense to me ", Zwei shrugs off."It does?", Ein says."I don't know, I just want all this to be over.", Zwei admitted."So...you were in HER head then Mirabelle and those two entered her head too. That's five people in ONE head...ow...this stuff hurts my head.", Lyca whines rubbing her temple."Well...whatever the case, we accept you apology and we're glad you understand that this was all a misunderstanding.", Ein replies as Camilla was a bit hesitant to forgive."Are we really going to forgive her so easily?""I mean, she did apologize Cami, and I can tell she means it. Why not?", Lyca replies."Thank you Lyca.", Caleb expresses, "Trust me guys, she really means it.""Mrrghh, alright. But ONLY because I trust Señor's judgement. Ju are still on very thin ice.", Camilla says glaring at Madeline."I understand and that's fair.", Madeline said as Camilla looks away with a huff. Madeline turns her attention to Caleb, "Now then, Mr. Bizzell about our clans mark...""Ma'am?", Caleb uttered."After careful consideration, I...have decided to allow you to officially become a member of the Marequine clan."Mirabelle and the girls were surprised even more so were her retainers."EHH?! High Priestess are you serious?!", Elaine stated in disbelief."What?! You're gonna take Chief away too?!", Lyca stated putting Camilla and the others on edge."Oh nononono, I intend to allow him and my daughter to continue living here. ", Madeline clarified as the other's settle down a bit, "As I mentioned, the link you and my daughter share has become so strengthened by your I doubt nothing short of death itself can sever it. But, of course, we cannot have TWO High Priestess candidates now can we?"Caleb and the others wondered where she was going with this."So I am going to make an adjustment to his mark. He will retain our abilities but lose the power of the High Priestess. I can do make said adjustment right now in fact. Mr. Bizzell. If you please.", Madeline beckons them toward her.Caleb stand in front of Madeline put on her mask with the eye symbol in meditation with purple flamelike aura emanating from her body. She order him to kneel on one knee. Then orders Mirabelle to come stand beside."Do you, Caleb Bizzell, dedicate your heart, under the eyes of Nyx and Onieori, to the Crescent Moon clan? To protect and love the future High Priestess with all your being?", Madeline spoke ceremonially."Yes, I do.", Caleb answered."You, my daughter, do you accept this human man, under the eyes of nyx and Onieori, as your most trusted confidante as you reach Priestesshood?""Yes, I do.", Mirabelle answered noticing a her mother smirking."Then as current head of the Crescent Moon clan, he shall be your...Chevalier. Take my hand, on which you will kiss to complete your contract.", Madeline presents her hand as her retainers gasp whispering to each other about something. Even Mirabelle was surprised by that.Caleb hesitates before looking to Mirabelle who gestures for him to do it. Camilla looks annoyed as hell. Caleb gently takes her hand and kisses it. At that moment, a powerful sensation sweeps through his body and the mark on his chest starts to feel hot. The mark morphs from a large hoof with a small crescent moon in the center to three smaller split hooves forming a triad around a large crescent moon."Whoa...that was different.", Caleb said standing up touching the place of his mark as the warm sensation dies down."I made some adjustments so should have an easier controlling the astral energy. Huhu, I'm actually quite. I never thought I would be the one to bring a Chevalier into our clan!",Caleb raises an eye upon noticing the retainers whispering to each other, "Okayyy, clearer the Chevalier title is a bigger deal than I realize so someone fill me in.""Well, I'm sure you're aware of our Chironian counterparts' propensity for choosing a human to form a master and mount union. However, our race has higher...requirements and standards in this regard; and humanity's aversion to our appearance doesn't help either. Sadly, many of our race go their entire lives without experiencing the intimacy of having a rider. That being said, there have been stories in the past where a humans formed very close, intimate relations with a Nightmare. ", Madeline explained as the last part really caught Camilla's attention."What?! How come I never heard of these stories?", Mirabelle inquires feeling out of the loop."Many of the details of these stories have been grossly exaggerated over time, so they aren't very reliable sources. However, there are a few that ARE actually based on true cases where a human formed a bond with a Nightmare after fulfilling the four criteria.", Matilda explained."And it would that this young man has fulfilled all of them! He is the first Chevalier our clan has had in over 150 years.", Madeline stated earning surprised looks from Caleb and the others."Damn, that's a...WHOLE lotta years.", Caleb says"So...what are these criteria that have to complete?", Zwei asks curiously."Well, both parties must accept wholeheartedly accept each other in this world and the dreamscape. Then the human must be indoctrinated into that Nightmare's clan and recieve a mark by the High Priestess.", Madeline raises her hand jokingly then proceeds, "After recieving his 'Chevalier' mark, the female may allow him to mount her and two share their first ride together. Lastly, the two consumate their union joining their hearts and souls. Huhu, I'd you two have completed everything and more, despite...not doing it in coherent order. Nevertheless, as High Priestess, I shall accept this union. Even if that union includes two people that are not even Centaur, I shall accept Lyca and Camilla as your 'Mistresses'. "Caleb the other girls look to her with profound shock and disbelief."WHOA! Hang on sec here! Are you saying they had SEX?!", Zwei stated bluntly as Ein looks to Caleb and Mirabelle hoping it wasn't true.Mirabelle blushes in embarassment as she and Caleb felt the eyes on them. They were trapped with no choice but to answer."Hahhh, yes...we did. Yesterday, in fact on our date", Caleb admitted."I knew that's what the smell was!", Lyca stated."But that's beside the point.", Caleb continued, " How do you even-wait...dumb question.""Dreamscape.", Madeline says with an innocent shrug."Mummy...tell me that is ALL you saw from Dear's memory.", Mirabelle spoke in a serious tone.Madeline tenses up blushing heavily touching her finger together in a vain attempt to look innocent, "Well..I may have snuck a peak at...a little of what you did during the full moon last night."Caleb and the girls faces go comically pale and wide-eyed."YOU WHAT?!", Caleb, Mirabelle, and Camilla shouted simultaneously."What WHAT?!", Ein stated beginning to panic, "What did you guys...wait...you guys were all and in front of Mr. Bizzell's room naked. Why were you all together naked?!""T-Tell me you didn't see me doing...that...with them.", Mirabelle complained repeatedly glancing to Camilla and Lyca as both puzzle over what she meant."Señora what are ju...", Camilla pauses in realization blushing remembering their make out session, "Oh Diablos mia that is right.""H-Hahaha! I get it, this is a joke, right?", Ein chuckled forcefully, "This is just some elaborate prank. I know for a fact that you wouldn't do something as RECKLESS and STUPID as having sex with Mr. Bizzell as ICEP students""Ok, Ein please, I can explain.", Caleb says attempting to calm her."Ohhhh, she means when we were all mating with Chief last night and we did sexy stuff with Mira. Yeah that was great!", Lyca stated upon remembering what she meant much to Mirabelle and Camilla added embarassment. Ein and Zwei jaws dropped in utter shock."Orrrr Lyca can do just put it out there. Thank you Lyca.", Caleb spoke sarcastically and Ein smile fades and her eyes twitches."No, NO! Ms. Kessler, that is not great! That is the exact OPPOSITE of great!", Ein angrily stated, "Why were you all naked in his room?!""Yeah Lycs how could you do something like that?! (without ME?!)", Zwei chastised scream the last part in her head."Oh don't misunderstand daughter, I'm not upset or disappointed. Heck, I'll admit your mummy was a little bi-curious in her late teens.", Madeline reminisces much to her retainers shock."Muuuuuum?! I don't want to know that", "High Priestess?!", Mirabelle and the retainers exclaimed stopping her."OK, WHAT IS YOUR DEAL?!", Zwei stated pointing to Madeline, " 20 minutes ago, you were leading a puratain crusade like Claude freakin' Frollo! Now you're super chill soccer mom?! What happened while we were checked out?!""Ah! Well...I guess now that I understand the kind of person my new Son-in-law is...I don't have to be as defensive.", Madeline dreamily spoke looking at Caleb.Caleb and the others were dead silent a moment before..."WHAT?!", they all stated in unison."Holllld up! Run that back! What are you talking about?!", Caleb demanded."Yes Mummy, kindly, explain!", Mirabelle added"I DID say you've both completed the 4 Criteria. You recieving my blessing to become part of the clan completed said union. That union is akin to marriage and her daughter of the current High Priestess...well I'm sure you can put together the rest. So by the rules of our clan, you are now part of the Marequine family. You...don't have to change you last name though.", Madeline casually explains as Caleb and Mirabelle and the others stare dumbfounded.Caleb could not find the words to express all he felt right now. He looks to Mirabelle who was just as lost as him.Suddenly the hear a thud. They turn to see Ein lying face down on the floor."We're done. I'm done. Everything is so done.", the busty weasel uttered repeatedly in defeat and depression."Ahhh crap! Ein's broken again. Come on sis, pull yourself together!", Zwei says trying to get her sister up."Ahem, excuse our intrusion High Priestess we would just like to add that, as Lady Mirabelle future retainers, we would also belong to you.", Freya spoke dutifully placing her hand over her heart."Until then, we look forward to that day...Lord Caleb.", Matilda started in a regal tone bowing her head as the other retainers followed suit.Suddenly, the Madeline's eyes glow brightly as she and the retainers go into a trance."Ohhh hell, what now?", Caleb says unsure if he's able to take any more surprises."Someone from our clan is contacting my them. Why, I don't know.", Mirabelle answered curious and slightly worried.Madeline and her retainers release themselves from their trance and their eyes return to normal."My apologies everyone. I would love to stay a bit longer but it would appear I am needed back this instant!", Madeline explains as her retainers put their masks back on."Oh...well...alright then. It was nice seeing at least.", Mirabelle says."Ehhh...", Camilla utters making the gesture with her hand."Ahem, in any case, thank you Caleb for your hospitality and I apologize for the sudden intrusion. I promise to inform you in advance next time.""No problem and yes...please do that.", Caleb spoke as calmly as he could.Madeline goes and hugs Mirabelle tight before pulling away cupping her cheeks. She then gives a worried look, "Promise me you'll be careful. Ok?""I promise Mum. Please let everyone at home know I'm doing alright.", Mirabelle says with a warm smile, "I love you.""I love you too, darling.", Madeline spoke sweetly. Lyca smiles as them as Camilla watches them then looks away in thought.Madeline then goes to Caleb opening her arms to him."Uhhhh...I'm good thanks.", Caleb says feeling uncomfortable."Awww, come now. It's just hug from your new Mummy-in-law.", Madeline spoke sweetly as Caleb could feel Camilla glaring with bright red demonic eyes."...sigh, alright fine.", Caleb sighed deciding to get it over with. Caleb just barely touches her firm back while Madeline hugs him close. She then rests her head close to his ear. He could then feel her I-cups mushing ever do slightly to his chest making him tense up."Take good care of my daughter, understand?", Madeline spoke in a serious but caring tone.Caleb pauses taking in her words, "I will. I promise."Madeline closes her eyes and thanks him humming contently as Caleb tried pulling away only for her to hold him closer to the point he could smell a sweet honeysuckle scent from her hair."Ok mummy, I think you've made your point.", Mirabelle spoke sweetly with a hint of venom in her tone.Madeline snaps back to reality and pulls with an embarassed blush, "Oh! Haha, sorry I got a tad carried away there."Caleb stood stunned for a moment before clearing his throat, "It's alright."Madeline's retainer's align themselves two to each side. They each link hands together before shimmering purple aura spreads around their bodies as the energy is absorbed by the High Priestess."Farewell, Lady Mirabelle!", Elaine stated."We hope to see you again soon! You as well Lord Caleb and his Mistresses, and his bodyguards...no hard feelings by the way", Emmeryne said looking to Zwei."We'll just call it a draw.", Zwei said fanning Ein's head."Bye everyone, it was lovely to see you all again!", Mirabelle stated waving to them as Lyca happily says goodbye as well and Camilla just sits wishing they'd leave already. Caleb waves to them as well.Madeline lowers her head concentrating as hers and all her retainers marks glow brightly and they all teleport out of the house back to their clan creating mini ripples in the space they once occupied before returning to normal.Caleb and the others immediately decompress letting out tired sighs. Seconds later, Drei appears from the hallway stretching her arms."Yawwwn, haa good roofie nap. So what I miss?", Drei inquired noticing the Mirabelle clones are gone."Well, Moon pie and I are now technically married.", Caleb replies his voice sounding hollow and Mirabelle smile awkwardly forcing a giggle."We're his Mistresses!", Lyca stated proudly as Camilla gives her a dubious look."They had a four way last night and I think Ein's dead.", Zwei stated as Ein lie on the floor; a broken soul her eyes empty and hollow.Drei gives a plain look, "Good, everything's normal. Now I'm hungry. Caleb, I'm taking half that rotisserie chicken in the fridge if that's fine.""Ooh, can I have the other half?", Lyca bounced up tail wagging."Sure, what the hell?", Caleb said plopping on the couch feeling exhausted as Drei rummages in the fridge grabbing. Lyca goes to the counter hungrily waiting as she splits the chicken down the middle and gives the half to Lyca who immediately begins gobbling it up.Drei pops a piece of lemon pepper chick in her mouth, "Also, last night's foursome was my idea."Upon hearing those words, all life returns to Ein's eyes. Her ENTIRE body immediately raises up to a standing position completely ignoring the laws of physics and startling Zwei."WHAT THE FU-"......WRSup fam! How's every been? So...this chapter was originally meant to go out the day after Valentine's Day but I guess Microsoft Word that it was April fool's and decided to NOT save half of the entire chapter. So I had to rewrite everything. Then there was the snow warning. I was spending more time studying for exams that were later pushed back and also left my area with power or the internet for 2 days. In short, it's been a trial to get this out.I hope you guys enjoyed the chapter. All things considered it was fun to write. Right now though, I want to focus more of classes right now so may not get the next chapter(which I'm 3/5 Of the way into), until late March or early April. Don't worry, it'll be worth the wait.AlRight that's about it. Make sure to follow, fav, and share all that good stuff. See ya later. Peace fam!
  
    Chapter Text
    Chapter 42: It Goes OnSup Fam! I hope you're all well! Classes are going well, work is going well, life is getting a little better day. Also, March 11th just passed aka this stories 3rd birthday! Now before we dive into this I need to make something known that I forgot to mention last chapter. THIS chapter marks the beginning of season 3. Last chapter was the end of season 2. So...WELCOME TO SEASON 3 FAM!After Ein's...outburst, the irate weasel woman a brief tirade on berating Caleb and the others, how screwed they were, and how angry she was at them and Drei. Caleb wanted to calm her but Drei stopped him allowing her big sister to 'get it all out her system'. After about 15 minutes, Ein finally started to run out of steam." ...aaahhh... that's it. We are done for. We are fucked cause you guys fucked! What would You do this Drei?! You know what our mothers are going think when find out we failed our mission cause we couldn't keep our charge's libido in check?! Our clans going become a laughing stock! ", Ein ranted on her throat tight and sore from nonstop angry talking. Caleb, Lyca, and Mirabelle look to her with concern and a bit disturbed not wanting to push her into another fit. Camilla and Zwei both sat with uncaring expressions. Both having become indifferent to everything happening about 10 minutes ago.Ein plops down on the couch hunched over elbow to her knees groans lethargically."Are you finished?", Drei asks in an unbothered tone plopping a tender white strand of chicken meat in her mouth. Ein gives her a stern look wanting to retort but soreness in her larynx impeded such action. Instead, she plops"Yes. Just...fuckin yes.", Ein said in a raspy almost defeated tone. Caleb then teleports to the kitchen looking for a cup."Good. Now you can finally listen.", Drei says finishing her chicken leg tossing the bone over her shoulder into the trash like a queen. Caleb teleports back giving Ein a cup of iced blueberry tea which she hesitantly accepts.Drei proceeds with explaining the details of her plan she'd been working on for a while now and why Caleb and the girl's actions during the full moon were a necessary part of it. Basically, she's turning Caleb into a valid case for human-liminal polygamous relationships. Caleb, the girls, and her sisters were naturally surprised and skeptical at first. Drei reminds them of the tension right now every since the bill legalizing interspecies relationships was announced. Not just the violent humans liminal protestor and hate crimes but, as of late, a number of liminal groups from species that practice multi-spousal marriage speaking out at how the bill excludes even alienates them. Then there are the traditionalist humans wanting to reinforce their hyper-religous monogomous beliefs while these practices as invalid and abominable. Naturally, it would only be a matter of time before a powderkeg fuse is lit and ICEP would be forced by public opinion to put species like Camilla, Lyca, even the Zyklons under extreme scrutiny. In order to dowse the fuse, Drei proposes showing the public a legitimate, untampered example of a multi-spousal marriage, with multiple species no less, is entirely possible."So there you have. ICEP wins, other polygamous species win, we win, and the assholes lose. Any questions?", Drei says sitting atop the counter with her legs crossed with Lyca sitting in the chair next to her gnawing on a chicken bone."Yeah, I do. Umm...are you out of your damn mind?", Caleb inquired as the girls and the Zyklons gave inquisitive looks."No, but you seem to be out of character. Usually you're more over-the-top than that.", Drei replies."It's been a looooong ass day and it ain't even dinner time yet. And I must be still fatigued from my dreamscape experience with my now mother in law to believe in a bunch hypothetical worst case scenarios.", Caleb says rubbing his eyes before crossing his arms apprehensively."I have to agree. That all sounds purely theoretical Drei.", Ein adds."It's kinda disappointing you'd say that Ein considering YOU keep up with the current state of a affairs in this country more regularly than I do.", Drei says catching Ein off guard before continuing, "You're aware of the growing tensions between humans and liminals because the idea of Interspecies breeding is on the table. How long before we see incidents like in Shanghai, Wuhan, or Hangzhou?""T-Those have nothing to do the U.S. and besides those are classified!", Ein defended."What do you mean by...'incidents'? ", Caleb asks"I just said it was classified!", Ein stated."Basically, examples of what happens when liminals and humans push each other over the edge. Home invasions, hate crimes, kidnappings, murder, and especially rape cases start skyrocketing. As a result, the entire species that participate in these heinous acts, even just ONE individual, are banned from the until further notice.", Drei explains much to Ein's frustration and Caleb and the girl's surprise."WHY WOULD YOU-""To give them perspective.", Drei cuts her off, "The way our country handled things is tame compared to HOW the U.S. would handle."Caleb and Ein eyes widen in deep realization of what she meant. Mirabelle and the others look to them unsure how to respond."What happens when liminal species with polyamorous beliefs in this country are pushed too far? Forced to conform to more 'human' traditions. Reviled and persecuted by traditionalist humans. They, among the few humans that support them, would turn to more...extreme actions to defend their beliefs. In turn, the ones doing the persecuting will have even more grounds to deport these quote 'heathens'.", Drei explained as the others ponder what she was sayng, "Eventually ICEP would be forced to no longer allow these liminals in the program anymore. That includes OUR species. Don't forget, we're still technically foreigners. Our contract only grants us so much authority and can be revoked for ANY reason."Ein and Zwei go quiet for a moment realizing she was right."Well...she does make a few good points.", Zwei admits as Ein gives her a look, "What? She does."Ein groans facepalming."Ok, then WHY didn't you just-", "Ok, then WHY didn't you just-"Caleb and Ein stated simultaneously before catching themselves and looking to each other in surprise."If you're both about to 'Why didn't you just tell us your plan earlier?', it's because you obviously would have rejected it immediately!", Drei says shifting one leg over the other."I mean...OF COURSE we would have objected to it because you realize what you'd been asking right?", Ein replies discontently."Yeah, even I gotta admit I'd have been...hesitant to uhh...go along with it.", Caleb admits rubbing the back of his head while noticing the dubious looks of Mirabelle and Camilla."I also didn't want to put any pressure on you guys. If this was going to succeed, it happen where you guys couldn't deny the emotional and sexual tensions and attraction any longer. You know, the natural way.", Drei explains drinking some tea she poured earlier."So what?! You still CHOSE to assist them in breaking ICEP law!", Ein insisted slamming her fist to the couch arm."Even IF I did nothing, these guys would have given in eventually. Look at these two for example.", Drei says looking to Caleb and Mirabelle both immediately tensing up, "If it happened with them, it was only a matter of time before the others followed suit. I just let them indulge themselves last night to clear up the tension.""And what if they get pregnant huh?!", Ein demanded."That's not a problem.", Drei says before taking a vial odd liquid and a Ziploc bag of strange light green bean shaped pods as Lyca curiously examined it, "I had him use this on his junk before doing the deed.""Wait, isn't that...", Zwei spoke walking to examine the bag."Yes. It's Māma's patented sperm killing concoction. I looked the botanical garden and I was lucky enough to find a few neem trees so I stuffed a few bags full of the seeds.", Drei says letting Zwei examine bag."What's a neem?", Lyca asks curiously sniffing the strange plants wincing at the garlicky-rotten egg smell as Zwei quickly closes the bag, "Ick, it smells gross.""That means they're at their most ripe. It's a tropical herb usually found in parts of India and it's a natural pesticide. I guess that's why the garden staff have it growing there. I use the oil in the seeds to synthesize a Māma's spermicide.", Drei explained wagging the vial, "I imbued it with a little of my chi both so the effects will last longer and to lessen it's potency. I'm preventing accidental pregnancy not trying to chemically castrate the man."Caleb cringes at the last part, "Jesus, you sure that stuff is safe?!""Of course it is. Māma perfected it herself( after some trial and error) and used on our father whenever they were in the mood but wanted protection without protection.", Drei says without a hint of hesitation."Too much information.", Caleb stated"Waayyy too much!", Ein added with an embarassed blush."But not false. All I'm saying is this is the best case scenario where everyone benefits. He and the others don't need to hold back anymore, ICEP gets a free success story, other liminals have grounds to make their practices valid, and schmuck somewhere gonna get a big, fat raise.", Drei finished earning some thoughtful expressions everyone."Well, if it means I am finally able show my love for Señor then so be it.", Camilla says in a passionate tone, "I could not care in the slightest about other humans or non-humans, whether they approve or not, nor give a damn about ICEP. All that matters is OUR life with Señor."Ein look to her incredulously as Caleb felt a warm sensation in his chest at those words."Indeed Camilla.", Mirabelle chimes in before snaking her arm with Caleb's and pressing herself against him, "I would honestly ask for nothing more.""Me neither!", Lyca stated hugging Caleb from over the couch a nuzzling his cheek affectionately. Caleb loving strokes the tops of their heads."Uhh, I hate to break up the moment but...what about agent Sterling?", Zwei brought up as the others, particularly Caleb and Ein, felt a sense of dread course through being. They almost forgot about him."Oh. GOOOODS! How could I forget about him?!", Ein shouts in despair while holding the sides of her head."I didn't. We're obviously going to let him in on the plan too. He's already taking a chance with his own proposal so it's unlikely he'll disapprove...much.", Drei replied."We don't know that! He never explicitly stated in his proposal, 'hey, by the way, you guys have a free pass to have sex whenever you want'? It's not like- ", Ein pauses as realization hit, "Oh god. What if he already knows?"Caleb and the others give her confused looks. It was then Caleb realized what she meant."Wait, you...you mean like with Filo that little fairy?""Yes! What if he's had another one watching us THIS WHOLE TIME.", Ein stated her eyes darting around trying to find out where their hiding place."Really? After what happened to last one, you'd think ICEP would let another take over so soon?", Zwei questioned also starting to observe their surroundings more closely."Well if not a Fairy, some other species that conceal themselves!", Ein stated look under the couch and around the other furniture for any traces of foreign presence, "A shapeshifter or even a slime. In fact, Zwei get some pepper we're testing every piece every piece of furniture and appliances in this house!""Calm down. It's unlikely he'd go have any third-party poopers watching us and risking his 'project' being compromised. Now, the next in-home visit is two days from now so I suggest we be ready to NOT fuck up.", Drei advised waltzing over to the center of the group and eyes Caleb and Mirabelle, "Trust me, there's a lot we have to tell him.""Yeah, maybe we should START with the apparent newlyweds here.", Zwei gives a knowing smirk at the couple, "So does this make you Caleb Marequine or Mirabelle Bizzell?""Ooohh don't say it so casually! I already feel like my heart is going to burst. Honestly, what was mummy thinking?!", Mirabelle groans sheepishly covering her flustered face in Caleb chest as he pats her back"Well...she may have overcompensated a bit-""That is putting it nicely.", Camilla added mid sentence."Ehhh...buuut at least she approves the kind of relationship we're in. Plus, it means you don't gotta leave. That's what's most important.", Caleb reassures with a smile. Mirabelle smiles back agreeingly"I second that! I don't wanna imagine never seeing Mira again!" Lyca stated emphatically."Her approval means nothing to me. However, I agree I could also could not bare to depart from Senora.", Camilla nods in agreement."Thank you.", Mirabelle spoke warmly with a smile, "Thank you all for standing up for me.""No problem Twilight Sparkle. Don't make it a big deal.", Zwei casually teases."You did great standing up for yourself too Moon pie, don't forget that. I respect the amount of strength that took to do that.", Caleb says hugging her close, "Even so, I'm still your man. I'm not just gonna sit and let anyone hurt you."Mirabelle looks at him with soft eyes, "Thank you, Dear.""Spoken like a true hubby.", Zwei teases"Shut up.", Caleb retorts.Ein lets out a tire sigh before standing walking with her arms folded. She turns to everyone throwing her hand up concedingly, "Fine, whatever, we don't have much option now."The other exchange glance before Caleb teleports to Ein's side as she starts sulking. She barely even reacts the action."Come on, Ein. No need to get your face all torn up. Everything gonna be fine.", Caleb says putting on a grin."Are you sure?", Ein asks in a serious tone making eye contact."...No.", Caleb admits his smile vanishing and Ein's rolls her eyes, "BUT...we are in the same boat. Now we can either paddle or we can drift along until a big ass storm wave comes along and drowns us. We're gonna need a all the strong arms we can get and you're a strong woman. Please help us paddle.", Caleb offers his hand to her.Ein looks to him seeing the earnest look in his eyes. Her demeanor softens and reluctantly takes his hand much to his relief."I-If we get fired I'll never forgive you.", Ein says coldly."Fair enough.", Caleb replies."By the way, why are you two dressed like morning after girls?", Drei inquires addressing her sisters less than professional attire.Ein and Zwei are caught off guard not sure how to respond."Actually, they were wearing MUCH less than that when they busted in ready to beat some ass. I gave them some of my old clothes.", Caleb explains much the their shock."You don't say.", Drei says raising an eyebrow at her sisters."I-I-IT'S not like we did it intentionally! There were unknown assailants past the perimeter and had been incapacitated! No time to make assessments! Instincts! Our instincts took over!", Ein stated trying to justify herself."Yeah excuse us if we think your lives are worth more than public decency.", Zwei defended feeling insulted. Caleb gives an inquisitive look to Drei who shrugs."We understand and we are very grateful Ms. Ein, Ms. Zwei.", Mirabelle expresses to the wind weasels trying to cheer them up, "Thank you you both.""No need for thanks Ms. Marequine simply doing our job.", Ein replied sitting up proudly as Camilla rolls her eyes, "Ah! And don't worry sir, we'll make sure to wash and return your clothes.""Nah it's cool. In fact, you guys can keep them if you want.", Caleb says.Ein and Zwei give him a look of surprise."R-Really?", Ein questioned."Sure. I told ya I don't wear them anymore. Use them however you want. Besides, they look good on you.", Caleb insisted giving them smile.The two blush faintly caught off guard by the compliment."Well thanks Boss. Honestly, I'm just lucky you have good taste.", Zwei says twirling her finger on the shirt collar."I-I'll be sure to take good care of them. This doesn't mean your off the hook though!", Ein affirms with a slight blush in her cheeks."Didn't expect to be.".....After some time to decompress, everyone went on about their business. Ein and Zwei swept the perimeter of Caleb's residence while Drei guarded the interior. Caleb called ICEP contractor to come out the next day to repair his bedroom door, which Camilla apologized profusely for, then secludes himself in his office to finish and send in a project proposal for his team's newest client. When he was done, he helped Camilla with her English reading skills while Mirabelle took over Caleb's usual role of helping Lyca understand basic math. Before long sundown came and it was time for dinner and to discuss their game plan.Caleb and Camilla in the kitchen serving up dinner while the Mirabelle finish washing up and setting the table. Drei sat at the counter with her phone occasionally sneaking looks at Caleb observing his every move soon becoming lost in her thoughts."Yo. Anyone home?"Drei flinches snapping her to attention as she turns surprised she didn't sense him."What?", she replied."I was saying the dinners done. We're just about ready.", Caleb says as Camilla walks by levitating the food they prepared for everyone behind her heading to the dining room."Oh? Good.", Drei spoke plainly."You alright? You were staring deadeyed at your phone while I calling you.""I'm fine. Thanks for the concern.", Drei politely replies"No problem. Hm...actually I just remembered something...about last night.", Caleb says as Drei eyes widen slight, "I remember I had this weird dream...about you."Drei restrains the urge to gulp nor show any sign of having something to hide."About me? What was I doing?", Drei asks listening in anticipation."You were like...sitting in my lap and...", Caleb trails off remembering the nature of the dream, "uhh...y'know what? It was just a dream. A weird, dumb dream probably influenced by the moon or something. It doesn't mean anything."Drei raises an eyebrow, "Hmm, probably.""Yeah. Today's been a weird day. I mean I freakin' got married to my first girlfriend I've known for a couple MONTHS", Caleb said trying to divert the conversation, "Aight, we should go join the others.""I'll be in there in a minute.", Drei says. Caleb nods and walks to the dining room leaving her to examine the video files on her phone. She then deletes one." 'It doesn't mean anything.'...I couldn't agree more.", Drei says to herself before putting her device away and heading to the dining room.......2 Days Later...The day of Sterlings visit finally arrived. Caleb and the girls were already mentally prepared and had a calculated game plan. The second he arrived they made him feel as welcome as possible offering to share breakfast with some freshly brewed coffee. He performed his usual evaluation on each of the girls and of course received very positive feedback on Caleb's caretaking skills. He was especially surprised that even Camilla was cooperative toward him. When it came time to wrap things up, Sterling pointed out everyone's odd behavior. He let them know he knew from the beginning they were hiding something. He then demanded they come come clean with whatever they REALLY wanted to say. They were silent for a moment with some, especially Ein, starting to panic.It was Caleb and Drei who stepped and began to tell Sterling... everything; from the full moon events to Mirabelle's clan visiting to Drei's plan.Here was his response....Sterling sat silently staring at Caleb the other's in deep thought with his clasped hands to his mouth. He then take a swig from his flask of bourbon and clears his the throat."Ahem...Ok."Caleb and the others were profoundly surprised by his answer."Ok?", Caleb mimics."Ok.", Sterling repeated calmly surprising Mirabelle and the rest even more."Wha...wow. Haha, this uh...a big surprise.", Caleb chuckles in relief."Believe me I know the feeling.", Sterling says with a plain smirk."Yeah, I mean we thought FO SURE you'd be angry.", Caleb"Oh don't get me wrong, I am positively livid.", Sterling switches to a deeply venomous tone catching everyone off guard and immediately putting them back on edge as the air grows tense, "Not only did you commit one of ICEP's major offenses on THREE seperate accounts but you mean to tell me there MULTIPLE Nightmare from Ms. Marequine's clan in this room and you didn't even try to contact me. In any other circumstance Mr. Bizzell, I'd be choking the shit outta you. Right before slapping you in handcuffs and your houseguests AND bodyguards would be placed under ICEP watch either being deported or reassigned.", Sterling seemingly threatened as Mirabelle and the girls grew more and more uneasy with Ein anxiety growing and Camilla getting ready for whatever she has to do if Sterling dared make good on his statement. Fear started to creep up in Calebs being as her felt a lump in his throat."You should thank your lucky stars...this isn't one of those circumstances.", Sterling says much to Caleb and the other's surprise again, "In fact, I believe this works out rather well.""W-What do you mean by that?", Caleb question cautiously."I mean, I agree with Ms. Drei. Honestly, the thought had occurred to me when I decided an the Multi-spousal marriage plan. If it's going to have ground to stand on there has to be feasible proof that relationships of this nature are not only possible but also sustainable. Can a single human truly handle the emotional...and of course sexual needs of multiple spouses? Well...looks like I now have an answer. Or, at least, the first successful test trial.", Sterling says as Caleb and the other look to each other."Yes, you do.", Drei steps up, "But even that is not enough I presume. You'll need further proof that their relationships are based on mutual consent and no third party involvement."Sterling gives her an intrigued look, "Why, yes. I'm guessing you have such proof?""Ask and you shall recieve.", Drei says before producing a USB drive from her slave and handing it to him, "That's over six hours worth of footage. Each one showing how deeply Mr. Bizzell has bonded with each of his houseguests.""Whoaaa, hold up. You've been recording us?! Like...the WHOLE time?!", Caleb stated as Madeline the girls were also quite shocked at their intimate moments being spied on."Not the whole time only what is necessary. Besides, I'm your bodyguard, it's my job to watch you very, VERY closely.", Drei replied nonchalantly with serious eyes."Reeeally channeling your inner yandere huh sis?", Zwei spoke."Only the useful aspects.", Drei replied."Useful or not, those are OUR moments! I'm ok with that no matter what the purpose is.", Caleb stated defensively as Mirabelle and the girls blushes feeling their hearts skip a beat."Admirable Mr. Bissell, but you have to realize that without these recorded moments your relationship with these girls won't have enough legs to stand on. At least, you have a higher chance of avoiding the worst case scenario.", Sterling informed in a warning tone before switching gear, "Don't worry, they will ONLY be used for objective research only under my close supervision. Trust me, ok?"Caleb thought for a second, "Ok.""Good, because now I'd like to talk about the fact that you and Ms. Marequine are now MARRIED under the laws of her clan.", Sterling says trying to hide the stress in his tone.Caleb and Mirabelle look to each other in concern."M-Mr. Sterling we can explain! We didn't know. Mother never talked about the nature of a Chevalier until at that time!", Mirabelle insisted."There's no way we could've known ESPECIALLY not me! It was the only way to make sure Moon pie could stay!", Caleb added."There's a song lyric.", Drei commented."Calm down you two!", Sterling stated making the two go quiet, "I mean we can use that in your favor as well."Caleb and the others look to confused."How? Exactly.", Caleb asks in an incredulous tone."Well, if in the case ICEP does try to separate you, there the of public risk backlash from Ms. Marequine's and other races claiming that our organization considers liminal marriage invalid. So, rather than light that dumpster fire I suggest we double down on my previous proposal with some suggestions from Ms. Drei here.", Sterling says gesturing to the wind weasel."What do you mean by 'double down'?", Ein inquired curiously."Simple, since the High Priestess of Ms. Marequine's clan acknowledges and approves the polygamous nature between Ms. Santana and Kessler, why don't we expand on that and say you are ALL married under Nightmare law? ", Sterling suggests."A-All of us? Married?", Mirabelle repeated looking to Camilla and Lyca."We can use this as a springboard for other host families with polygamous species. Start them off getting married under the laws of THEIR culture THEN, after obtaining permanent citizenship, have them married under U.S. law. It's like Common Law for Liminals!", Sterling stated nodding to himself in approval the more he thought about it, "Yeah...this could work but you'll have to do your part too.""How do you mean?", Caleb says raising an eyebrow."Have more sex.", Drei said plainly making Ein choke comically spit out her tea...all over Zwei. Caleb, Sterling, and the girls were also taken aback."Really? There's like...5 other places you could have...sigh brb gettin a towel.", Zwei says going to the bathroom."The fuck?!", "The fuck?!", Caleb and Ein exclaimed simultaneously."NOT how I would have phrased it.", Sterling clarifies shooting a look at Drei who shrugs, "But yes, as she mentioned earlier in order for any of this to be worth a damn romantic as well as SEXUAL relationships among multiple spouses has to proven sustainable.""A-A...Are you saying what I think you're saying?!", Ein stated incredulously."I'm saying...I'm allowing Mr. Bizzell and his houseguests to engage in...ahem physical relations.""ARE YOU SERIOU-", Caleb, the girls and Ein shouted in sheer disbelief before Sterling caught them."BUUUUT...under a few conditions: First, no one, and I mean NO ONE outside this group can learn of this. Obviously. Second, if at any time any of you are SOMEHOW caught performing such acts, I will deny any involvement nor will Ms. Zyklons and her sisters be held accountable..."Ein eyes widen at hearing that before looking to Drei curiously."Lastly, and most important of all, NONE of your activities can result in procreation!", Sterling stated in a serious tone, "Luckily that part shouldn't be an issue. Correct Ms. Drei?"Drei takes a neem pod from her sleeve, "I have enough of these to make sperm killer serum for a year. If used correctly we won't have issues and he won't have issues down stairs.""Perfect. Now then, Mr. Bissell, do we have a deal?", Sterling says standing up extending his hand.Caleb glances to Mirabelle, Lyca and Camilla who all seemed to be on board before standing up. He firmly takes Stirlings hand "Yeah, we have a deal.""YAAAAYY! This is great Chief! We can mate whenever we want now!", Lyca howled in excitement hugging Caleb from behind her tail wagging ecstatically and nuzzling her head into his back."Whoa, haha ok easy EASY now girl!", Caleb says turning his attention now to the She-wolf trying to keep her from knocking him to the floor."Heh. This is certainly a surprise. ", Camilla smirks with an intrigued tone before leaning over to whisper to Mirabelle, "Honestly, I did not believe it would work.""I know, I was starting to have my doubts as well. Now I feel as sprightly as a tot", Mirabelle sighs then chuckled sweetly."What about ju, Señora Uno?", Camilla facetiously asks Ein.Ein merely sits in stunned silence trying to comprehend the new reality of their situation. Camilla waves her hand in front of the weasels unblinking eyes and agape mouth."Alright, I'm clean, so what I miss? Where we at?", Zwei says walking rubbing her face with a blue towel the slinging it behind her neck."He's actually giving them a pass to have sex whenever they want.", Ein utters in pure disbelief weakly pointing her finger then letting it flop to the couch limply."Really?! Awesome! I guess we're going full on harem route after all. I see Lycs isn't waisting anytime.", Zwei points out seeing the She-wolf happily recieving headpats from Caleb. She then notices Ein didn't react merely sat stone faced with a look of profound shock."Aww come on sis. You should be happy for them.", Zwei says patting her sister's back comfortingly."I honestly have so many mixed feelings right now.", Ein says."Good, that's better than having zero feeling. I'm sure Baba(dad) would be proud sis helping another man with three he loves dearly.", Zwei assures as Ein ponders for a moment."...Yeah, perhaps.", Ein softly admits with small grin. Zwei then turns around hiding her flushed cheeks and lewd grin."( ~Plus, that means more sexy romp time I get to feast my eyes on. Huhuhuhuhu~)", she thought giggling and drooling a little while Ein and Drei raise a curious eyebrow at her weirder than usual behavior."Alright, then it's settled. This will be an added trial of of Multi-spousal marriage experiment. Keep me posted on their progress Agents Ein, Zwei, and Drei.""Sir!", "Sir!", "Y-Yes Sir!", Zwei and Drei stated with a salute with Ein fumbling hers a bit."Hey, Mr. Bezzie, can I talk to you outside for a bit before I go?", Sterling inquires with a smirk. Camilla and Drei give him suspicious looks"It's BIZZELL and sure ok.", Caleb says before Sterling grab his stuff then follows the agent."Senor?", Camilla inquires"It's cool, I'll be right back.", Caleb assure before closing the door leaving the girls to discuss among themselves. Already he could he chatter from behind the door shaking his head with a smirk. He sees Stirling standing with his back turned beside his black Lexus smoking a cigarette with the plumes rising overhead."Alright then Sterling.", Caleb says walking up to the agent who then casually flicks the cigarette to the ground putting it out with his shoe, "Whatcha-AH!"Before he could react, Sterling grabs Caleb by the collar and slams his back against the vehicle glaring at Caleb intensely."Shut. The fuck. Up.", Sterling retorted, "You and the others need to SLOW DOWN! You are doing too much. Ok?! You're doing too much! Can I have ONE goddamn visit to this goddamn house without almost having a goddamn stroke! Do you know the kind of shit going on lately?! All these protests and liminal hate crimes going on?! Watch the news some time!", he growled tightening his grip on Caleb's collar"Ok ok! I know! This all just happened! I never intended for this crazy I'm sorry!", Caleb pleaded.Sterling grits his teeth before shoving off Caleb making him fall to his knee holding his necks to massage away the pain. He glares at Caleb intensely in thought."I...I don't mean to make your job harder than what is Sterling. You have to believe that.", Caleb says picking himself up, Frankly, this just out of control. I mean...I never even imagined having one girlfriend let alone THREE wives. It's overwhelming sometimes. It feels like I'm slowly losing control of my life if I ever had control to begin with."Sterling expression softens before going over and resting his back against his car, "Yeah well welcome to adulthood."Caleb sighs putting his hands in his pockets looking around the peaceful neighborhood with the occasional car driving by, "It doesn't get easier does it?""Not for the most part.", Sterling says, "But then there are those moments where you find that moment of pure bliss that makes the bullshit worth it. Could be hobbies, a place, even people."Caleb looks to him understandingly, "Yeah, I hear ya. I noticed quite a few of those when I'm with them. I'll do anything to protect what they give me everyday."Sterling gives Caleb an inquisitive look, "What's that?""...a reason to move forward.", Caleb admit looking up to the blue cloudy sky in thought."Heh, cheesy.", Sterling says"Whatever, it's still true.", Caleb scoffs."Well, at least you have have your reason. I have my own as well.", Sterling replies facing Caleb, "You have no idea how many like you want what you have Mr. Bizzell. Now you can choose to give up what you have...or give them their own. I wanna give them their own happiness. What say you?"Caleb pauses a moment then answers, "I want to give them their own so I don't have give up mine.""Good answer, .", Sterling says with a smirk before taking out his keys, "Welp, I'd say this was successful visit I look forward to what you'll surprise me with next time.""Hopefully, nothing big.", Caleb says rubbing his head as Sterling smile fades."Yeah, but remember, just follow the rules I set up and I won't have to kick the shit outta you. Those fancy powers aren't gonna protect you from a good ass whoopin'. We clear?", Sterling professionally threatens with a hostile aura."Crystal.", Caleb replied quickly."Good.", Sterling says as the aura disappears and he steps in his car starting the ignition. He rolls down the window, "Oh, by the way, congratulations to you and Ms. Marequine or should Mrs. Bissell?", he says before quickly pulling out the driveway before Caleb could respond then driving away."IT'S BIZZELL DAMMIT!", Caleb yelled before flipping the bird at no one before noticing an elderly caucasian lady watching him curiously while carrying her cat in baby hammock, "Hey, morning to ya."She turns around quickly walking away not responding.Caleb rolls his eyes, "Oh yeah lady, like I'M the weirdo.", he says before heading back inside....As Sterling was driving, he thought of the look in Caleb's eye when he asked him that last question. It reminded him so much of the look Fantina has whenever she spoke so proudly of her beliefs. He comes to a stoplight giving himself a moment of respite before he takes out Fantinas MON badge. He look to his passenger seat seeing a vision of her sitting next to him asking if he wanted to get a drink after their assignment.In truth, he had his own reasons for all this. If the Bizzell house proves to be a success, imagine what that could mean for species like Fantinas as well? Maybe the ban on hers species will finally be lifted too. Maybe she'll stop this nonsense with the Malone family. Maybe...just maybe...she'll come back to him...err, ICEP, he meant. This was his chance to make for the past; for her and others like her."Yep. We all have the right to be a little selfish. We're just humans.", Sterling says tightening his grip on her badge.*HONK* *HONK*"GO DUMBASS! IT'S GREEN!", Screamed an irate driver in a red Chevy truck.Sterling immediately to it as the guy and a couple others kept blaring their horns, "ALRIGHT! FUCK OFF ALREADY!", he screamed before hitting the gas........over 3 weeks have passed...Somewhere in the city of Madison just 20 minutes from Huntsville, a young human woman wearing a sexy blue dress and matching stilettos sat inside a large company waiting room with her face covered by a mask."Sweet, so are things gucci on your end Madokki baby?", the lady spoke on her phone in a flirtatious tone"Yes and don't call me that. I heard from the others that everything is ready on their end as well. What about you, Jennifer?', spoke a feminine voice."I'm working on it on my end bitch, don't trip. We spent like a week gathering intel and it seems accurate. Don't worry, this lady is good as mine.", the woman apparently named Jennifer says crossing her legs seductively as a man in business attire walks by so intrigued by her action that he loses focus and colluding into another guy opening the door all their stuff and making her snicker, "Oh, yeah! Since I'm down here in bumpkin land, I thought I'd get into character more."'Please don't.', the voice said."YEEYEE! Which won'er you polecat stankin' trailer floozies done fucked ma man!", she says like an over-the-top southern lady catching some confused looks of passerbys.'...Never do that again, that was terrifying. Now complete your end of the mission...',*click*, the phone hangs up."Pssh, yeah yeah I know.", She said putting her phone away the picking up the manilla folder looking through the resume, credential, and project details of the person she was inhabiting, "Ugh, why'd you have to be such a neeeerd? Whatever time to get to work hard then play with some good old Alabama boys.", She emphasized doing the 'blowjob'-gesture with her hand and mouth before recoiling holding her mouth. She adjusted her mask and, for split second, revealed the deteriorating flesh and muscle tissue around her mouth with her teeth partially exposed in a holes that used to be her cheeks.'Dammit! That being said, this vessel is starting to reach it's limit. I better upgrade soon before I can get any big Southern dicks in me.", Jennifer thought wide a lewd grin her eye glowing snow white for a second."Ms. Shine? Excuse me, are you Ms. Jennifer Shine?"Jennifer looks up eyes widening upon seeing a beautiful ginger haired woman in business attire and lab jacket. She smirks through her mask looking the woman up and down hungrily."Yeesss Ma'am! And YOU must be the crazy daimond I've been looking for.", Jennifer teased inciting a light chuckle out of the woman."Ahhh yes. It's pleasure to meet you. Welcome to Boeing Defense and Aerospace Center. My name is Sasha Burns and I'm the Director of Dynamic Analysis.", she greeted with a smile."Nice to meet cha! Excuse the mask, got bit of a cold right now don't want to get others sick.", Jennifer giggled."Oh sorry to hear. I hope you get better so I can see that pretty face.", Burns complimented."I hope so too. It would suck having to where this all the time.", Jennifer chuckles." I know. Alright, If you would please follow me.", the woman says motioning for Jennifer to follow."Oh, I'll happily follow you anywhere.", Jennifer says following behind while taking a good at her NEW behind. Her pupils glow with a haunting white light , "You look great by the way. You do spin classes?"...Meanwhile...The last few weeks have been eventful but pleasant for Caleb and the girls. For starters, Caleb's company had recently been forming a partnership with Boeing Defense and Aerospace center thanks to a project proposal sent by the design engineering team( the group Caleb is apart of with Rodney as Lead Analyst). Whatsmore, they recently started hiring Liminals to the company, mainly as custodians, receptionists, sales people, or machine shopworkers. There were mixed reactions among the other workers. Some were glad to see more diversity but several others actively disapproved and straight up resigned as they refused to work in the same office space as 'monsters' and 'monster lovers'. It was especially bad for those like Caleb and Rodney that were ICEP hosts to said monsters.This was only a microcosm of the turmoil happening throughout the country. Protests against the legalization of interspecies marriage continues to run rampant with a growing number of violent hate crimes against host families and supporters of the LiL'SIR ( Love is Love, Species is IRrelevant) movement. It got even when the government announced it also working on a program to allow liminal children attend human schools. However, one event that absolutely shook the nation, be it human or liminal, was groups of neo-nazis, KKK, and a liminal hate group calling themselves 'monster hunters' took over the streets of Charlotte, North Carolina in mass protest of the 'creatures' invading the country, corrupting their 'human way-of-life', and the traitors that help them. Soon a mob of counter protestors arrived, many of them LiL'SIR followers, to defend their peaceful town. MON forces and police did everything they could to keep things under control but it soon spiraled into chaos and tragedy when two men, armed with M16s, took to the rooftops above the counter protestors and opened fired on the entire crowd. The men were quickly apprehended by MON amidst the panic and supportive cheers of liminal haters but not with claiming the lives of 31 people, 22 humans and 9 liminals, and severely injuring 17 others. This heartbreaking event opened the eyes of many at just how much hate and xenophobia is consuming the country.There was even an interview with the victim's families including the homestays of the human victims during the protests. All of them voicing their grief over their lost loved ones. However, one that stood out among the rest was a Juro-gumo ( Arachne breed) named Jin-Ae who told of her awful experience in ICEP being treated with fear and disdain by 'could-be' hosts. However, an incident following arrest of an abusive host led to her meeting the man she later fell in love with. An ordinary citizen turned impromptu savior named Calvin Fritz. At the time of the tragedy, he was out shopping for them. He wasn't even a protestor...yet he recieved a bullet through the neck and bled to death with his scattered purchased items around him. Of the items, the Juro-gumo learned he had bought her a bunch of assorted die colors to use for her silk clothing; it was going to be a surprise as confirmed by a close friend of his. She expressed her grief and rage toward the people who robbed her of her happiness, her beloved, and the father of her unborn child. That last part absolutely SHOOK the media; no one expected that. She spoke how she didn't care what anyone thinks or if she is deported from the country, as long as she is allowed to raise their daughter. The living proof of the love they shared. She was then put under ICEP protective custody.Shortly after, the president of the United States gave a speech addressing the tragic events that occurred in North Carolina along with the condemning the actions of the radical extremists by challenging their notion that coexistence is impossible. The presidents speech served as a message from the humans and liminals that believe in ICEP, desire peaceful coexistence, and wish for a future where everyone regardless of species can join hands as neighbors, friends, coworkers, even spouses. A message to the humans and liminals who wish for ICEP downfall, that differences with always divide us, that hatred for one another IS the answer. They're all outnumbered.ICEP's Senior Director Judy Ginsberg later announced that the Interspecies Marriage Bill will proceed as planned. However, she subtly warns that the same punishment still applies if ICEP hosts and homestays are found guilty of copulation prior to the Bills instatement. While some hosts were understandably shocked and disappointed others understood the purpose was for their protection.But enough drama let's get back to the Caleb and the gang...It was another regular morning in the Bizzell household.***Mini-Lemon***"Haa! Chief! I'm so close!", moaned the voice of Lyca as silhouette of her undulating body could be seen from the curtain.Inside the Caleb's room, the man himself lie in bed as the nake She-wolf rode him cowgirl-style.Yep, nothing irregular here."Ah! Ah damn Lyca!", Caleb grunted huskily gritting his teeth alternating squeezing her toned muscular thighs and butt. He works up her toned abs and perky little breasts feeling the sweat of her undulating body as her lustful moans fill the room.He looks up at the depraved, lewd grin on her face as she pants feverishly with a deep blush and tail swaying wildly. The little metal crescent moon pendant on her choker jingled with every bounce her body."Chief! Chief!", Lyca loudly exclaims quickening her pace as the sound of their lower flesh regions slapping together spurred her lust. Caleb digs her nail into plump, firm booty thrusting himself up trying to match her pace and feeling the deepest parts of her hot crevice. He give one final thrust firing his load as deep he could and triggering her intense orgasm. She throws her head back howling in pleasure as all her muscles contract before going limp and collapsing on Caleb's bare chest; both of them breathing heavily trying to catch their breath.***Mini-lemon end***"Haaa...That...was...too awesome.", Lyca panted into the crook of his neck even licking him a bit, "Morning sex is the best.""Yeah. I agree. Still though-", Caleb started but was immediately interrupted when his bedroom door goes flying open. It was Mirabelle dressed in her pajama top and skirt."Dear? Are you up? You don't want to be late tod-", the Nightmare stated before noticing the pair and immediately blushed beet red, "Blimey! L-L-Lyca?! What are you doing? I only asked you to wake up Dear!""Ohhh, She woke me up alright.", Caleb says sitting up along with Lyca still against his chest before she scoots off him laptop standing up letting the sheet fall off her naked body catching Mirabelle and Caleb attention."Sorry Mira, I was. It's just...I walked in I was about to wake him but then I say his...thing just...standing up all hard and...I got closer and...your scent made me sooo hungry. I just couldn't help myself. Plus, I could smell Drei neem oil stuff was still strong so...", Lyca explained picking up her underwear and oversides t-shirt and causally putting them on, "I mean YOU would've done the same, right?"Mirabelle paused a second sighing admittedly, "True. I probably would have.""Aight, the fact that y'all are both in agreement about NOT refraining from sexually assaulting me in my sleep is disturbing enough, but I should make something clear here.", Caleb says sitting on the side of the bed, "When a man has morning wood that is NOT an invitation to take it for a ride sometimes he just needs to pee. You know what it's like having to cum while ALSO needing to pee? It's not fun.""Ew gross, I don't want someone else's urine inside me!", Mirabelle shudders at the thought."Me neither. Especially if I'm sucking Chief dick. I don't wanna taste pee when he cums.", Lyca recoils sticking her tongue out ."The almost never mix anyway so that's unlikely.", Caleb clarifies."Ah, so blowjobs aren't off the table after all! Good to know.", Mirabelle says in a chipper tone before switching to a more sultry one giving a lustful stare."I agree. I actually really like doing that. I would hate to give it up.", Lyca says licking her lips hungrily."Glad to see you girls aren't easily deterred.", Caleb relents before grabbing his phone seeing what time it was. ."6:40. Ok good, looks like ya did wake me up on time Lyca.", Caleb says as the She-wolf gives a toothy grin."What time is your trip again, Dear?", Mirabelle asks."Rodney and I are meeting the client about the proposal at noon but first we're stopping by the office for something Hope we get it, this partnership is huge for our company. ", Caleb explained going to his closet and grabbing his work clothes then fresh underwear and socks from his drawer. He then opens a drawer and grab one of the many vials of spermicide Drei provided, "Aight, I'm taking a shower. I'll get breakfast started in a when I'm done.""Ok.", "Kay!", Mirabelle and Lyca stated simultaneously before he teleports out of his room to the bathroom."Hey, wanna help me with my workout this morning? I wanna try out what I learned at the the gym.", Lyca asks."Hmm, ok. A good run might drive away my friskiness for a while.", Mirabelle says slightly shifting."Heh, yeah, I can smell your hormones from here. I guess Chief's scent is getting to you too huh?", Lyca spoke with a cheeky grin."And who's fault is that is that for stirring him up?", Mirabelle says narrowing her eye before puffing out her cheeks and crossing her arms in her signature Moon pie pout, "Hnnngh I should have woken him up myself. I wanted to be forced to resort to doing naughty things to wake him up!""Uhhhh, pretty sure if you WANT to do them then your not really being forced.", Lyca spoke sheepishly scratching the top of her head."Useless details. Now, the park or just the block?", Mirabelle asks holding out her palm."Park! We can have a race!", Lyca stated emphatically."Oooor a light run. Nothing too exhausting.", Mirabelle says not up for sweating beads at 6 a.m. before Lyca touches her palm*zoom* They teleport out of the room.Meanwhile, in the bathroom, Caleb had already stripped down, put out his clean clothes in corner sink top. He take a moment to look at himself in the mirror. He could see the results of his frequent workouts with Lyca and training with his Nightmare powers on days he didn't need to go to the office. Though still kinda chubby, he notices he had lost a little weight. His abs and upper body muscles were more defined and his lower was a bit more toned; especially his butt which Mirabelle greatly appreciated.He then steps in the shower, turns it feeling for the water warm. When it was warm enough he steps in getting soaked before lathering himself with AXE bodywash. He sighs relaxing just enjoying the warmth covering him. Internally, he started reflecting on the last few weeks since Sterling essentially gave him and the girls a sex pass.No soon as they had time to have sinkin, it was like something had awakened within them. Where does he even begin? It's like they cranked up their skills in seduction to a dangerous degree. Dangerous to Caleb's libido, that is. They'd pretty much take almost ANY opportunity they could to have sex with him. Luckily, thanks to Drei's insistance, he's gotten into the habit of using her spermicide oil on a daily basis so there is nothing to worry about in the anti-baby making department. Of course, this only meant the girls were less restrained which led to some interesting situations but occasionally forcing him to reign them in with Ein's occasional help. He soon grew noticeably stronger and had a lot more stamina even confidence than before. A couple times they did it out in public but were careful in not being caught also partially because of the Zyklons.Frankly, he was thankful for Ein and her sisters for always watching his back. He really needed to show his gratitude somehow.He then touches the Chevalier mark on his chest tentatively as the warm water cascades over him. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and concentrates. The mark glows faintly as he raise his hands forming a purple spherical energy barrier between his palms. He moves his palms closer together condensing the sphere into a tighter dark purple ball. He focuses and absorbed it allowing his entire body to be covered head to toe in viscous-like ripping aura. He could no longer feel the water hitting his body. He moves his head directly under the showerhead, eyes wide open, and the water droplets literally bounced off his body like plastics beads.As mentioned earlier, Caleb had been training his Nightmare abilities and has made noticeable progress with the help of the girls...and little bit of Madeline's instruction to Mirabelle via astral projection on his progress. Teleporting came naturally to him for some reason and, for now, he can teleport a maximum of 15 feet by himself and could do so 10 times successively with a 1 minute cooldown in between. Through a few trials, he and Mirabelle learned they could teleport much greater distances if they were physically touching, even just their fingertips. The maximum so far is about 6 miles with a 15 minute cooldown. Mirabelle even taught him one of her clan's stealth techniques that silences footsteps and conceals his presence which soon got the hang of. As for mana control, Caleb was slowly getting better at manipulating it and conjuring durable energy barriers to to point where her could now cover his entire body in almost invisible protective armor. He even figured out he use It offensively by incorporating some Judo techniques. It still took a lot of concentration and energy on his part but he was making progress.It didn't take long for Caleb and the others to realize that his powers were tied to his mental state; strong emotions more energy output. Furthermore, thanks to some information from his now mother-in-law, he learned that the frequently mating with Mirabelle actually makes them both more powerful.Or, as Madeline put it, the connection between them is something of a symbiotic relationship. Caleb supplies Mirabelle with plenty of his spirit energy( basically semen), which her body converts to mana, amplifying her natural abilities, and any surplus is transferred to Caleb for his usage. And it's not just Mirabelle, it works similar with Lyca and Camilla. He passively absorbs some of their energy while giving spirit energy to them. It would explain his increased physical strength, endurance, and even a bit of a healing factor for minor wounds like cuts.All these changes didn't bother him too much. He loved his girls and enjoyed every single moment with them no matter how overwhelming it could get. However, the way things are right now in this country, in this state, and the looming threat of the Malones, he knew he couldn't afford to be careless. No matter how hard it gets, he needed to protect the life he has now. If these powers can help with that he'll use them.Caleb raises his arm up seeing the rippling covering his hand. He clenches his fist focusing on anything that makes him angry. The aura around his fists began to pulsate with purple electric sparks before dark purple flamelike wisps covered his fists. As dorky as it sounds, he decided to give this ability of his name which was inspired by what Hana said when he first used it; that it looked like "deep purple aura". So that's what he calls it: 'Deep Purple'."Alright, guess that's enough.", Caleb sighs calming down as the purple aura fades into his body allowing the water to once again make contact with his skin rinsing off any soap left before turning off the shower. He steps out the shower grabbing his towel wrapping it around his waist."Huhu, finished sooner than usual I see.", spoke a sultry voice making Caleb flinch before turning to see Camilla sitting atop the bathroom counter her legs crossed. She wore a large white wrapped around her curvaceous body and nothing else. Her ample J-cup cleavage pushed the poor cloth to where the whole thing could fall off any second and the combination of her thick child-baring hips and plump thighs and Latina butt accentuated her devilish charm."See something ju like Mi Amor?", Camilla asks in a sultry tone staring with lustful gaze her slender spade-tipped tail swaying sensually.Caleb clears his throat, "Maybe not something but definitely someONE. Were you uhh watching me the whole time?""I only walked in moments ago. I was going to ask to join ju but ju seemed to be practicing with your mana and I didn't want to interrupt", Camilla says getting down from the counter closing the distance between them as Caleb feels body heat up in excitement and a familiar stiffness downstairs. Camilla smirks sensing his arousal."Y-yeah just thought I'd sneak some practice in. Did you want something?", Caleb plays coy already seeing in her eyes exactly what she wanted."I was going to have bath and I need help with my wings again.", Camilla emphasizes spreading her large demon wing nearly making the towel fall off, "I really need some...strong, attentive hands to get every last inch.", She emphasizes walking her clawed fingers up his firm chest staring hungrily with demonic red eyes.Caleb takes her hand gingerly and looks her right in the eye not back down, "Well lucky for you my Devil Darling, these hands are no stranger to a girls wing-related needs.", he finishes kissing her hand making her smirk with a blush."~Huhu, that will do nicely~.", She spoke walking past him sensually swaying her shapely as Caleb looks on wordlessly. She then undoes the knot on her towel allowing the fabric to fall to the floor making Caleb's eyes widen see her fully naked sexy back and plump latina hips and butt. She stops before rounding the corner to the large tub to smile at him temptingly, "~I'll be waiting.~"Caleb watches her round the corner as her tail sways behind her.'Times like this I think there is be a God and he is testing me.', Caleb thought to himself with a sigh. He grabs Drei's spermicide and applies the entire contents on her privates barely flinching from the burning sensation. He grabs a sponge and proceeding to the tub....Another lemon...Camilla sat in the tub with her back turned breathing laboriously and trembling with pleasure as Caleb lathered her right leathery black wing in cocao and shea butter scented soap suds already finishing the other. She mutters something in Spanish under her breath."That feel good?", Caleb says working his way to where the base of her wing connects to her shoulder blades. She nods arching her back feeling a surge of pleasure."S-Si! Haa...haa...muy bueno Señor haaa...", Camilla replies hugging her ample chest together shuddering in delight with every circular motion he made on her leathery but smooth wings.Caleb smirked having learned she was indeed enjoying herself whenever she goes full Spanish. He could then feel her tail snake around his waist rubbing against him; yet another good sign. He stands up giving her a moment to catch her breath and rinse off her wings by wringing out the sponge over them. As the suds trickle down her right wing he notices vertical scar near the bottom where that asshole slashed her. He felt a tinge of anger before calming himself before finishing up."Alright, that's done. Want me to do your head neHAAA?", Caleb elicits upon feeling a set of clawed fingers fondling his balls before looking down at the hungry Demoness smiling seriously with body glistening alluringly with soapy white foam."Actually, I believe it my turn to take care of ju.", She spoke seductively beginning to stroke his hardened manhood then proceeding to swirl her forked tongue around the head of his penis making Caleb groan in pleasure at the sensation.She pressing her naked form against his thighs before slowly stands up dragging her soapy breasts like large sponges up his body making him quiver at the sensation. She takes the initiatives a gently pushes him backwards guiding him to the edge of the tub sitting him down before straddling his lap. Her body felt heavy against him but not in an unpleasant way. She pulls his face her chest smothering him in slippery wet mountainous flesh making her coo in delight at little stubble tickling her flesh."Mmmph AH C-Camilla...come on.", Caleb spoke looking up at her from her breasts which Camilla thought was cute, "I need to get dressed. I don't wanna haa... be late. I still need to make breakfast for y'all too.", Caleb lightly groans trying to fight a losing battle against her prison of desire. However, the feeling of her wet, mountainous breast smothering him, soft but firm rear in his lap, and her womanhood glistening with soap and love nectar grinding against his hard shaft made that a near impossible task."Ju worry too much Señor. It is still very early even the weasels are not here yet.", Camilla assures petting his head then lifting up his chin lock eyes hungrily with his, "Besides, hearing ju and Senora Lyca so earlier in the morning...I could not resist having a morning meal too. Please, let me taste your delicious spirit energy.", Camilla says with a grin her eyes taking on a demonic red glow as she grinds her ass harder into his lap.Caleb shudders instinctively moving his hands up and down her sides coming to her plump ass and giving a light squeeze making her gasp."A-Alright, I guess...a round won't hurt.", Caleb moans digging his fingers in her malleable butt making Camilla quiver with delight. She then brought her down closer to his."~Kiss me Señor.~", She moans her heated breath hitting his lips.Caleb obliges her smashing into her plump, soft lips humming as her broad, forked tongue against his lips wanting access. The two interrained their tongues in heated passion for a minute before pulling away with a strand of saliva connecting them. Camilla raises up on her knees positioning herself over her hard member before lowering down with Caleb help guide her.His tip prods her so soggy entrance before being greedily swallowed almost to the hilt. Camilla arched her back as her moans of pleasure echo throughout the bathroom hugging him tightly. Caleb clenches his teeth groaning from her smooth walls coil around his manhood. The strange glowing uterus mark appears again on her lower stomach which they found apparently happens every time he enters her.Camilla's hips start moving instinctively transitioning into her bouncing up and down taking his cock as deep as she could. Her tails wraps around both of them trying to connect them even more. The sound of her ass repeatedly slapping against his lap along with her breast bouncing tempting spurred on Caleb's lust as he thrust upward trying to match her rhythm. He moves one of his hands from her butt to her bouncing breast digging his fingers into her squishing flesh and messing with her nipple making her moan louder. He then takes it in his mouth alternating sucking her hard and swirling his tongue around her flesh bud as the demoness moans loudly to the ceiling holding his head securely."AHH! Señor! So intense! I love it!", Camilla huskily moans mouth agape eyes clenches in sheer pleasure."I know ya do. Haa...like how I know... you love it when I suddenly take the reigns.", Caleb uttered before grabbing under her thighs and picking her up to her surprise. He sits he on tubs edge as she looks at him in anticipation, "Turn around please!"Camilla lightly giggles at his polite assertiveness before doing readying herself placing her hands to the tile for support."I am ready mi amor.", She spoke seductively swaying her butt with her tail brushing up his erect member.Caleb grabs her hips lining himself up before thrusting inside her again. Camilla moans loudly in pleasure at being taken from behind by her 'Destined One'. The slapping sound of wet flesh delighted their ear drums as Caleb relentlessly pounding her ass. He grabs two handfuls on her ass cheeks molding them together as her tail wraps firmly around his waist."J-Ju love mi culo don't ju Señor?! That is fine! Use me any way ju want! Ay!", Camilla spoke in delirious lust as drool escaped her lewd grin."It's a fine ass! I can't help it!", Caleb grunted pounding her harder and faster like a jackhammer creating ripples against her posterior with every crash on their hips. He was already reaching his limit and he could she was too."¡Oh discordia, sí! ¡Fóllame mi amor! ¡Empapa mi vientre en tu deliciosa semilla! ¡Sí! ¡SÍ!(Oh discord yes! Fuck me my love! Drench my womb in you delicous seed! Yes! YES!), Camilla bellowed breathing laboriously tongue hanging from her mouth digging her claws into the floor tiles."Haanngh!", Caleb elicits giving one final thrust shooting his hot load deep in her love canal. She screaming in pleasure as her orgasm hits her like a tsunami washing over. Her body shimmers with red aura as every muscles tense up before she goes limp against the tub.Caleb pulls out of her as the mixture of their orgasms leak from her entrance into the water.***Lemon end***Camilla rests her upper body against the floor tiles trying to catch her breath as Caleb stands behind her also panting hard. He walks over and sits next to her before leaning over brushing her hair from her face. She smiles at him before raising up on her elbows puckering her lips with closed eyes. Caleb leans down enjoying a tender kiss with beautiful Elder Devil before parting staring at each other a moment."Ok...aside from me, what would you like for breakfast?", Caleb teased with a smirk.....After the events in the bathroom, Caleb got dressed and decided to start on breakfast with Camilla joining him to halve his workload. She even used a spell she recently invented to protect his clothes from getting dirty. Mirabelle and Lyca returned from their workout with the former sweating profusely and the latter extremely proud of her workout progress but also sweating alot. The two went in the back for a much needed bath. Camilla couldn't help snickering deviously as Caleb playfully rolls his eyes.Meanwhile, the Zyklons were doing the usual morning routine of surveying area of Caleb's home for any suspicious changes. Ein and Drei appears in a gust above the roof of a two-story house a couple block from thier house."All good. Nothing out of place on my end. You?", Ein asks."No, unless you count that.", Drei says pointing to a male Kobold liminal walking two labrodor retrievers on leashes, "Something about that feels wrong.""Well, aside from...that...I'd say everything is good. Yeah. Good", Ein says as Drei notices the tone in her voice."Something wrong?""Nothing, I'm just...still coming to terms with all this. I mean it's almost 3 weeks since agent Sterling agreed to your plan and...I wonder if what we're doing is right. Mr. Bizzell and the others are definitely happy but...it's definitely not safe considering the chaos going in this country. I just wonder...", Ein trails"What would dad think?", Drei finished as Ein doesn't answer, "Ein, you know what dad went through for us just so he could be with our moms. What makes people like Bizzell any different?"Ein thought for a moment, "I...guess you have a point. Still...do they HAVE to go at it so often?! S-Sex I mean. They even did it in public a couple times! Luckily were able keep them from being discovered."Drei looks off to Caleb's house, "They've been pent up for awhile. Plus, they are all technically newlyweds. It's best to just let them fuck themselves sick of each other like all married couples.""Maybe but still, I know it's our duty to always be near them but...hearing them and sometimes SEEING them...in action just...makes me feel... weird and...left out? Is that wrong?!", Ein confesses blushing in embarassment."Such is the burden of lifeguard duty. All the eye candy but none of the fun until someone needs CPR.", Drei commented."Not only that but... Mr. Bizzell's scent is getting stronger. ", Ein trails off blushing, "It's getting harder to maintain composure when I'm around him.""Drei gives her a look then turns away, "It's a byproduct of his relationship with them. I'm sure with enough exposer we'll adapt to it..""Of course, but what about other females outside the house? I don't want a repeat of 2 weeks ago with those Echidnas.", Ein says grimacing at the memory of them."Then Mr. Bizzell will have to get used to regularly breaking hearts. That's easier said though so we'd better brush up on reverse cockblocking skills.", Drei replied."Sigh, well anyway, at least we've done well keeping them safe all thing considered. Heck, even Zwei has really shown more initiative lately. She's been diligently surveying the security cameras in Mr. Bizzell house almost nonstop. Glad to see she's taking her responsibility seriously.", Ein praises....meanwhile in the underground panic room...Zwei was watching the security feed from this morning of Caleb and Lyca having sex while. She was naked in a swivel chair furiously masturbating with dark brown dildo she ordered some time ago."Oh yeah! You ride him Lycs! Ride that dick! RIDE IT! RI-AAHAAAA!", Zwei screams out as she came hard in the chair. Good thing the walls are soundproof down there....back to her sisters..."Yes. She has really cum into her own as a bodyguard.", Drei commented with a plain expression"What does that mean?", Ein inquires curiously tilting her head."It means I'm hungry. Please go see if they've started breakfast while I go 'relieve' Zwei of surveillance duty for now.", Drei spoke."Ok. See you.", Ein replies as the two generate a gust of wind vanishing....The members of the Bizzell household and the Zyklons enjoyed a wonderful breakfast together as per usual. As they were finishing, Drei came out and said that she alone will accompany Caleb during his meeting seeing as the location was already heavily secured. Her sisters didn't object but Caleb was a bit surprised. The last few weeks he noticed she had been acting bit strangely around him; sometimes coming off a bit cold and distant.Finally, it was time to leave."No need to be nervous Dear. You'll do brilliantly.", Mirabelle encourages fixing Caleb's collar and necktie inspite of his insistents that it was fine."I-I'm not nervous. Who said I was nervous?", Caleb assured."You didn't have to say it Chief. I can smell your your sweat from here.", Lyca points out sitting on the couch with Zwei."That nose of yours is a blessing and a curse.", Caleb replied."Mostly the former and you know it.", Lyca spoke with a cheeky grin."Well, that just goes with saying.", he spoke."Among other things.", Camilla chimes dissipates a blur magic seal after finishing the dishes as she approached the counter, "Are ju nervous about presenting your ideas to those humans, Señor?""It's a project proposal and... really I just wanna know why the hell the Branch Manager chose ME to do this with Rodney? I mean, this is usually Rauj's area I've never done one myself for a real client; especially one this big ...", Caleb said anxiety coming to the surface before Mirabelle cups his cheeks."But HE is not you my Dear. Your director probably saw something in you and if it's the same phenomenal speech you've practiced with us then it's understandable.", Mirabelle encourages."Granted, we still only half understand what you're talking about.", Zwei casually admitted earning a stern glare from Ein."I just know what you do is really, REALLY complicated.", Lyca addeds, "But that shows how smart you are Chief, since you can talk about like it's regular conversation.""Personally, Sir, I believe you do an excellent job of conveying the information in an engaging and clear manner. I'm sure they'll agree to a partnership with your branch when you knock their socks with your speech.", Ein spoke assuringly."And if not, it will be their loss. Foolish humans as those deserve nothing good to come to them.", Camilla spoke a bit coldly folding her arms earning looks from the Zyklons."Ms. Sartana, what did we talk about?", Ein calmly warns."That only applies when they are in this house for a purpose or if I'm in public. Right now, I am in the comfort of mi casa with no other humans in sight.", Camilla affirms."What about me?", Caleb inquires."Of I never include ju Senor. Ju are mi Destino NOT a foolish human.", Camilla replies"What about Cheryl?", Ein points out as Camilla shoots her a glare, "She seems to really like you. It couldn't hurt to-""I will stop ju right there!", Camilla cuts her off, "That chica is tolerable at BEST and she barely deserves that.""Still, 'chica' is at least a notch above just 'human or foolish human', Ein pointed out."Do not start with me. I will burn off every strand of hair from your body.", Camilla half-threatens generating a small green seal from her fingertip."Ok! Jeez.", Ein waves off."What we're TRYING to say Dear is you have nothing to worry about. You were picked for this and for a bloody good reason. Give it you best.", Mirabelle says kissing him on the cheek."Thanks you guys.", Caleb felt more relaxed and smiles warmly before cupping a finger under Mirabelle's chin and kissing her sweetly before separating, "Love you."*zoom* Caleb teleports in front Lyca to her surprise to plants a loving kiss on her lips then repeating the same phase making her smile.He teleports again in front of Camilla and gives her the same loving treatment to her delight. He then teleports to Ein and Zwei giving them a par on the head to there surprise while requesting they 'handle things while he's gone'.Both were caught off guard by the gesture, blushing lightly, but still assured he could count on them."Ok, let's go Drei.", Caleb say reaching down before she blocks his hand."Nope. None of that.", Drei says giving him a cold look."Sorry.", apologized before grabbing his stuff.Love you too Dear.", "I love you too Chief.", "Te quiero, Senor(I love you, Senor), the girl harmoniously spoke.Caleb smiles before heading out the door........Work 10:50am...Caleb and Drei arrived at his firm to meet up with Rodney who texted that he was picking up some last minute reports from the rest of their team. He exits the elevator seeing welcome by the sounds of people answering phones, working on their computers, or moving about for one reason or another. The only major difference was the noticeable number of liminals now working on this floor. Apparently, after the 'monster haters' quit it left a lot of open positions for any Liminals apart of ICEP workforce program to to apply. Most of them on this floor were of humanoid appearance; Several Elves, a few Monoeyes, a small mix of Werecats, rabbits, and foxes, and two blue oni women.As Caleb walked through the department heading to his team's usual meeting room, he noticed a few humans shoot malign glares his way with some whispering spiteful even some racist comments. He chose to ignore them looking straight ahead. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Caleb noticed many of the liminals, most of them female, staring at him with curiously with flushed cheeks. The second he looked their way some avert their gaze in embarassment while others winked or made other seductive gestures at him.Apparently, the frequent sexual activity he experiences with the girls isn't just giving him superhuman abilities but, as hypothesized by Drei, is also changing his biochemistry to where his body produces a high-octane musk that makes him appear to certain females that catch his scent as an ideal breeding partner. She proposed that it's particularly stronger other males likely due to him mating with 3 different species regularly. Now everywhere he went female liminals would turns their heads. He has been flirted with even asked out a few times in the office; sometimes even strangers. It was admitedly new to him, even a bit flattering, but he politely turned them down. It did have it's downsides with some females that don't take 'no' for answer. Like with that crazy group of Echidnas that damn near assaulted him if Ein and Camilla didn't step in. Yet another change to add to the growing list.Caleb the meeting room where he sees the rest of the team sitting around the table as he quietly stood in the doorway listening."Ok, so with this we should be able to keep the processing costs to just below the minimum.", Spoke a Caucasian lady dressed business casual present a large grey binder filled with notes and charts to Rodney who nods understandingly. She then notices Caleb, "Oh, hey Caleb!"Rodney along with 3 other members turn to Caleb."Hey Rachel, sorry to interrupt.", he says taking a seat and closing the door."Oh you're good. I was just getting Rodney caught up on a few things.", she clarified."By that, She means 'I forgot to send out memos to everybody now I have to scramble at the last minute and hope for the best.' ", taunted a tall Caucasian man in business attire( for reference, think of Jim from 'The Office')."Ah screw you, Clay!", Rachel chided."I don't date coworkers. Plus, the new receptionist downstairs is way cuter.", Clay replied."I didn't know taller women were your thing.", commented an dark skin man with noticeable Indian accent."Tall, smart, and sweet, the most attractive traits of any woman.", he says in a whimsical tone."I guess Ray's 1 outta 3 then huh?", Rodney making the others chuckles heartily as Rachel wore a jaw dropped. Caleb cracks a smile a bit."Ok, you are reeeeaaally lucky you're my boss.", Rachel stated glaring at him menacingly but in a joking way."Alright, Caleb man, wait for me I'll be done in minute then we'll head on down there.", Rodney advised."Ok.""Do not be nervous just speak calmly and clearly. This is a huge deal for our department and we cannot afford mistakes.", Raj emphasizes."Thank you for the reminder Raj", Caleb says glaring at him."Raj, just because you're salty about NOT being selected doesn't mean you can put uneccessary pressure on him.", Rodney chided him to which Raj reluctantly apologizes and Caleb more or less accepts."Aw come on, he has no reason to be nervous. He's the Equalizer.", Clay spoke with a knowing grin."Oh goddamit...", Caleb mutters under his breath in annoyance."Yeah! He sure is the Equalizer! Look at him with that Denzel swag.", Rachel playfully stated quickly joined by Rodney and the others."Ughhh. Please. Stop.", Caleb bemoans covering his face in his hands.***Narrator sidenote***For those who don't know, a couple days ago, one of the former employees in the accounting department upstairs who quit due to the hiring of liminals somehow snuck inside the building with the intent of killing his liminal replacement. He found them and attacked with a large hunting knife spewing garbage like, "You creatures won't replace us!". He was then knocked unconcious by Caleb who was there at the time to pick up some cost estimates and instinctively acted. The man was subsued later arrested and the liminal person was taken by MON for questioning. Naturally, Caleb was praised for his deed but didn't want the attention. Soon people started calling him the Equalizer much to his added embarassment. The event made him even more popular with the liminals and liminal supporters of the building since many still remembered or were reminded of what he did for the Devil girls on 4th of July.***Sidenote end***"Hey, come on we're just joking man. It's awesome how you protected that girl. I wish I could've seen it myself.", Clay assures."Yeah, it was on YouTube for a short time but now ICEP pretty much takes down anything like that within an hour.", Rachel says a bit disappointed."Hey whatever happened with that Nekomata lady anyway? Did she ever get to thank her hero before he rode off into the sunset?", Raj jokingly inquires."Ok that's just-", Caleb started but was interrupted by a knock at the door."H-Hello?", came a familiar feminine voice."Uhh come in?", Rodney spoke.The door opens and there stood the Nekomata lady wearing casual business attire; light green long sleeve dress shirt with black pants. She had piercing green feline eyes, light tan fur covering her leg and arms ending in large 5 digit cat-like paws, large cat ears, and twin white-tipped tails protruding from her back. She a slim but curvaceous figure with perky D-cups and plump, shapely thighs and rear. She wore a black leather bag on her shoulder. A small grin crosses her lips the second she spots Caleb."M-Mr. Bizzell?", She inquires shyly."Yeah...um ...right?", Caleb asks."Y-Yes! Um, I just wanted to speak with you moment.", She says with a light blush in her cheeks.Caleb is taken aback a moment before noticing the cheeky look of his team members instantly become embarassed."Yeah, let's use the room next door.", Caleb says. She happily agrees going to the next room."Oooh I guess she wants to thank her hero properly huh?", Raj cheekily spoke."Shut up.", Caleb replied as he leaves the room. He notices a few female liminal workers watching him curiously but pretends not to notice.He enters the room where Rikka stood waiting for her him her tails swaying about."Alright, what did you want talk about?", Caleb inquire before noticing her shifting nervously avoiding eye contact with flushed cheeks, "uhh you o-""I made this for you!", She cuts him off bowing as she presents him a small black bento-style box, "I-I wanted to thank you for saving my life much earlier but MON kept under their protection until that man was fully detained. P-Please accept it."Caleb was taken aback a moment before inspecting the box a little."Thank you. That's really sweet of you.", Caleb replies accepting the box, "I heard of these but I never had one before. Hehe it's like my own little slice Japan. I'll save it for lunch."Ms. Yukimura's blush deepens, "I-I used only the freshest ingredients I could find. I wanted you to show how thankful I am. Y-you can call me Rikka.""Ok, Rikka it is. Again, that's very sweet of you but, to be honest, you didn't need to do anything at all.""I wanted to! I owe you my life after all.", She says with a blush."You don't OWE me anything. The fact that you're safe is more than enough. You have every right to be here, work, punchout, goof off a little, or deal with other people dumbass shit just like the rest of us. We're coworkers ", Caleb affirms.She stares at him thoughtfully and with twinkling eyes before managing to summon up her courage, "T-Then...M-Mr. Bizzell...I...I want to go on a date with you!""I'm sorry but...I have to say no.", Caleb quickly replied much to her surprise and disappointment."W-what? W-Why?", She asked with trembling eyes."I won't go into details but I'm kinda already in a relationship.", Caleb says making sure to keep his voice down."I-I know...with multiple liminal girls."Caleb gives a shocked look, "Wha?! How do you-""You're scent.", She interjected to Caleb's surprise, "Along with your own, I can smell multiple other liminals girls on you. I-I won't tell ICEP, I promise! I just thought...one more wouldn't hurt. Please accept my feelings.", She finishes staring with cute, hopeful.Caleb pauses a moment then sighs, "Thank you for that...but the answers still no."The hope in her eyes vanishes now replaced by sadness."Listen, it's not that I don't find you attractive. You are beautiful and sexy and a sweetheart and I'd be happy to have a professional and platonic relationship with you...but not romantic. There's nothing wrong with you. You're perfect. I'm... simply not interested.""O-Oh...", She said weakly hanging her head low with her ears and tails drooped trying to hold back her tears.Suddenly, she is surprised when feels his large hand on head patting her head and ears. She looks up at him seeing his warming smile."Hey, come on now. That doesn't mean we can't be friends AND coworkers. Like I said, you have every right to be here too. If whenever your having a hard time, or someone bothering you, or you just wanna talk, I'm right here. Ok?"Rikka stares into his kind, brown eyes feeling a warmth in her core before smiling back, "Ok.*Knock Knock knock*, came a knock at the door getting their attention."Yo, Cal? We gotta go bud.", came the voice of Rodney.Caleb withdraws his hand to her slight disappointment."Sorry, looks like I gotta go. Remember what I said now and thanks again, I'll enjoy lunch you made.", Caleb says before putting the bento away in her bag, opening the door, and leaving with Rodney as Rikka stood watching him leave.Despite getting rejected, she didn't feel too bad. In fact, she felt like she understood the kind of man Mr. Bizzell was if only a little. She decided she will be satisfied just being friends with him for now. Perhaps, with time, he'll start to become interested in her."I'm not giving up that easy.", Rikka spoke with a determined smirk....Caleb and Rodney were heading into the parking lot with their necessary work-related stuff. Caleb couldn't help feeling kinda proud of himself right now. He felt like he was gaining just a small iota of control. And it felt good."Hey, Rodney? Let's take my car.", Caleb insisted.Rodney gives him a curious look, "Well, this is a surprise. I don't think I ever seen the inside of your car before. Shotgun!""Rear view.", came voice of Drei as she appears behind them."AH! Oh! Haha , you scared me uhh...Caleb's littlest bodyguard? Sorry I still forget y'all names.", Rodney admittedly in embarassment."Really because I find it easy to remember yours. I start thinking of the word 'disappointment' in human form.", Drei commented."Ouch.", Rodney utters"Don't let it get to you, it's her way of saying 'Hi'.", Caleb assured unlocking his car doors."How does she say 'Bye' th-", Rodney says noticing she had disappeared, "Wait, where'd she go?""Annnnd there's your answer.", Caleb says putting his stuff in the backseat as Rodney did the same before getting in the driver seat starting the engine.Rodney gets in the car immediately noticing how clean, and well-maintained it was."Hey, pass me that AUX cord?", Caleb requests before Rodney looks down at pocket on the door pulling out a long green audio cord. Caleb plugs it in along with his phone already set to his playlist.......city if Madison...People could be seen all around going about their business either heading to work, going inside shops, or enjoying some breakfast at nearby restaurants."I said I wanted vanilla ICED coffee! Do you see any ice in here?"A woman sitting outside the patio of a Starbucks complained to a liminal waitress with large brown mouse ears, brown fur on her arms, and slender rodent tail sticking from her uniform."I-I'm sorry ma'am! It was my mistake!", said the scared mouse girl apologizes."The MISTAKE was hiring a dirty, oversized RAT like you to serve food!", the woman reviled the poor before shoving cup to her chest splashing the beverage on he uniform, "Throw that away and get me what I ordered send a HUMAN out this time!""Y-Yes...ma'am.", utters the mouse girl as she quickly slinks back inside whimpering a bit.The woman mutters a derogatory term. The other patrons, human and liminals, notice the scene but choose to stay out not wanting confrontation. Cars could be seen driving before some come to a halt at the traffic light. Suddenly, the sound of a baseline trap beats could be heard from approaching in the distance. It was Caleb riding in his grey Honda and front windows down. As it gets closer lyrics can be heard...*if you want to fully immerse yourself in this scene, listen to 'Black Beatle' while reading*'That girl is a real crowd pleaser. Small world, all her friends know me. Young bull livin' like an old geezer. Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly. Frat girls still tryna get even. Haters mad for whatever reason. Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'. They lose it when the DJ drops the needle',... blasted from the car cruising down the street catching the attention of some passersby and restaurant goers. Although they were likely more surprised seeing Drei just...chilling on the roof of the car lying on her side in Queen pose and bopping her head to the beat.The grey Honda comes to hault at the traffic."I'm a fuckin black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal! Rockin John Lennon lenses like to see 'em spread eagle...", Caleb bops as Rodney sat next to him trying his best to copy Caleb's beat happy to see him in great mood today.A police cruiser pulls next to them. An officer rolls down his window. Caleb turns down the volume and looks straight ahead as Rodney looks confused then realizes what was up. Drei whistles getting the officer's attention while presenting her MON badge. The officer looks to his partner nod before the light turns green.Drei knocks on the hood, "Louder."Caleb turns the volume back up and he along with Rodney starts boppin' again and the police just watch them leave....They continued onward before finally arriving at the Boeing Defense and Aerospace center, a large complex with water fountain in the center of the entrance which was guarded by security. They park closest to the building, grab everything they need, and proceed inside while Drei monitors the surroundings for anything suspicious. They show their security clearance badges they were provided before a couple guards escorte them inside with Drei stealthily following."Hi! I'm Rodney Hillcrest and this is Caleb Bizzell we're from...and we have an appointment with the director of Structural Loads and Dynamic Analysis.", Rodney explained to the lady at the front desk."Alright...Ah yes! She'll be with you in a moment she's finishing up with a previous appointment. You can wait over there.", the receptionist advised pointing to the waiting area.Caleb and Rodney thanked her before taking their stuff and sitting down in the waiting area. Rodney notices Caleb repeatedly thumping his knee."You alright man?", Rodney inquires in concern."Yeah man. I'm good. Better than good I am...real good.", Caleb says trying to hide the anxiety in his voice."Hey! Don't be nervous bro, you'll do fine. Just treat it like a normal presentation-""That could cost our company a partnership worth THOUSANDS of dollars.", Caleb finished in a plain tone."Yeah, but DON'T focus on that part. Where'd that energy you had before go? Listen, that proposal you showed me even I'M convinced to partner with us. You got a good head on your shoulders and they'd be crazy not to hear your ideas! Don't be nervous. Are sharks nervous when they take town a seal?! Hell no! They keep swimming and biting! And we're gonna keep swimming until we catch a big blubbery juicy seal! Are you a shark bruh?!", Rodney stated as Caleb gave a confused look."...Yeah?", Caleb spoke lowly with a small grin."I can't hear you! Are you a SHARK?!""Yeah!""ARE we gonna get that seal?!""YEAH!""Then let's bite the shit out of that seal! Here we come! Baadum...Baadum...", Rodney started giving an urging smile."Baadum baadum...", Caleb continues with a wide grin.Both men then start singing the Jaws theme getting themselves pumped and attracting weird look from the receptionist and a couple strangers. Drei observes from nearby with a dry expression."Huh, so this is what a closeted bromance looks like.", Drei thought.They are then approached by a liminal woman, a grey haired inari, wearing business casual attire. A white button down, thigh length black skirt with black heels and long fluffy grey fox tail and ears, . She raise an eyebrow at the two human men and their strange ritual."E-Excuse me!", She spoke up getting their attention, "Madame Director will see you now."Rodney and Caleb straighten themselves up to look more professional before standing up."Thank you ma'am. Ready Mr. Bizzell?""Yes.", Caleb replies before looking to the Inari woman, "Kindly lead the way miss.""O-Of course. R-right this way hehe.", the Inari utters turning away hiding her rosy cheeks having gotten a whiff of Caleb's scent before leading them further in the build coming to an elevator that took them up. Drei stealthily follows them.The elevator ride was short without much talking. Only thing of note was Caleb pretending not to notice how the Inari kept staring at him with deep blush. They are let off on the second floor where the Inari woman leads them to a set of door. She knocks."Director Burns? They have arrived!""Come in!", called a feminine voice from the other side.The Inari opens the doors to a large office, brown polished wood table, large bookshelf to the left, 2 large windows with blinders giving a good view of the space shuttle outside. A large mohogany wood desk with a desktop Windows computer, various office supplies, even a few family photos. Standing with her back turned staring out the window was a woman with ginger hair. She turns to them and approaches with a welcoming smile."Welcome! You arrived earlier than expected. I'm Director Sasha Burns.", 'Burns' says before looking to the Inari, "That'll be all."The Inari slightly bows respectfully before stealing one more look at Caleb who grins shyly at her. She blushes and turns away becoming flustered and hiding her small grin."You must be Mr. Hillcrest. Nice to meet you.", Burns says offering her hand to Rodney"Pleasure to finally meet YOU ma'am. I heard so much about your work.", he says shaking her hand."Uh-huh.", She said with a smile before turning to Caleb offering him her hand, "And YOU must be Mr. Caleb Bizzell."Caleb takes her hand firmly to her surprise, "Ahem, it's good to finally meet you.""Oh, I can certainly say the same.", Burns says with a smile as her eye faintly glow with white light. She slowing releases his hand staring at him with slight predatory gaze before switching gears, "Now then, shall we begin?"....WRMe when writing a chapter"Ok, I'm going to keep this chapter 6000 words. Guaranteed."*9,000 words later*Me: "Alright, did a little more than intended even added a few things I didn't I needed. I think I'll end things here."*12,000 words later*Me: "Uhhh...ok this is fine.

    Chapter Text
    Chapter 42: Phantom Menace...1 week earlier...Satella and rest of Komanda Monstra had been busy carefully planning out their mission to capture the Nightmare and eliminate Caleb Bizzell and whoever else they're associated with. They were met with many hurdles that hindered progress in the form of MON's constant monitoring and the frequent protests between LiL'SIR and groups opposing the recent bill. It wasn't until the events of North Carolina that things went in chaos. Through that chaos they were able to slip into Alabama relatively undetected and set up a small base in an abandoned closed down bookstore close to the border."Now, once we manage to locate the target, annihilate him and anyone who stands in our way, subdue the Nightmare, and transport her back to our base. However, we first need to obtain this Caleb Bizzell home address. Vernal. Madoka. You both have done reconessence on the City of Huntsville. Correct", Satella summarizes to the others of Komanda Monstra who were all seated around different spots of the dilapidated store."Yes, we've done about all we could with MON and ICEP closely monitoring everything.", Vernal informed resting her chin to her palm while dragging her finger on her tablet screen"It's mostly because that uhh...crazy stuff in North Carolina and these human in red face masks calling themselves 'monster hunters' running around.", Madoka sitting down on what was once a small bookshelf before taking out her phone, "What's more, this guy barely has any online presence at all. What he does have is blocked by ICEP.""It's not all bad though we managed to find a lead to where he likely works. A manufacturing engineering firm in the Northwest area of Huntsville.", Vernal says showing on her tablet a map of said area."Excellent! So one of us just needs to go to where he works and find out his home address.", Ember stated clapping her clawed scaly together and Hush, who was sitting next to her, nods in agreement."Da(Yes in Hungarian). However, considering the current social climate, ve must exercise greater caution than normal.", Satella reminded touching her finger to her chin."Well, we also learned that this company recently began hiring Liminal ICEP workers. Maybe one of us can go under cover as an applicant.", Vernal suggested."But you forget ICEP has become more extensive in their background checks. Even if we use either Madoka or Nikami's abilities, there's still too many hurdles to trip us.", Ranka pointed out leaning against wall large tiger-like arms folded in thought, "One of them is obtaining the target's address with arousing suspicion.""That is why ve will obtain it by more 'legal' means?", Satella spoke as a few members raise questioning eyebrows, "If one of us was a superior with access to employees records. That is vhere you come in, Heather.""Hey, you guys seen this app called 'Face-It'?", Heather spoke waggling her phone at Madoka who kept her eyes forward with a look of annoyance, "It shows you what you're gonna look like when you get old and fucked up.""Heather!", Satella commanded firmly startling the ghost girl out of her new body making it slump limply, "Pay attention! Your part of this mission is simple. Find and possess a high ranking official within the company, search employee information, then send it to the incursion team.""Alright, can do! One thing, if the CEO or whatever turns out to be a woman can I keep the bod? Follow up, if it's a dude, can I play with his weewee and snap you guys some dick pics?", Heathers questions with a Cheshire grin much to the others annoyance."JUST DO YOUR PART IN THE MISSION YOU PERVERTED POLTERGEIST! I WILL TAKE A DICK PIC IF YOU GET A CHANCE THOUGH!", Kulah threatened bearing her claws and earning some questioning looks."Can do, first cumstomer hahahahaha!", Heather chuckles rocking the body she was possessing like Kermit laughing."I should have finished school.", Madoka lamented in a cold tone."Ughh, alright so Madoka, Heather, Kulah, and Vernal will be the incursion team. While I and the others will focus on transporting back to base.", Satella informs them before nodding to Hush who nods back getting up and walking off to the side, "Now, we know Nightmare are Mana-users so we'll subdue it this."Satella pulls out metal collar with mysterious runes on from her sleeve."I-Is that...an enslavement collar? The ones that Fallen Angel sold to the Malones?", Nikami inquires.Hush returns with a large travel case going to Satellas side. The Mantis proceeds to open it up."I requested 9 of them from Mama Rosé subordinates along with a few mana enchanted guns.", Satella explains as Hush presents the eight collars on her scythes like jewelry before sliding them back in the bag with a couple Uzis, three pistols, and a large sniper rifle. Satella faces the group twirling a collar on her finger, "We each take one to increase our odds of subduing the Nightmare.""I can dig the subjugation part. It's what my people excels at. And I've been meaning to update my arsenal.", Vernal spoke tapping the whip on her grip then brandishing the Uzis, "These have 'Vernal' written all over them. MMm! V likey!""They definitely suit you. Now, is everyone, Heather, aware of their roles?", Ember inquires to which they all voice agreement.Satella nods in satisfaction before looking to the collar she clenched in her hand in thought.Heather re-enters her current body nonchalantly leaning back in her seat....present...The meeting proceeded as planned with minimal issues. Rodney provided an excellent setup to soften up the client and presenting the value their company offers in terms of energy storage system and additive manufactured turbine blades designed to reduce work losses.He then handed the floor over to Caleb. He walks over to the laptop and inserts his flash drive as 'Director Burns' watches him. Caleb gulps trying to still his nerves taking a short deep breath."Thank you Rodney. Ahem as the manufacturing industry continues to expand and reinnovate with new processing methods and rare metals from liminals countries being adopted into manufacturing, there are now greater capabilities of improving aerospace equipment and propulsion systems. Now this proposal highlights some of the developments we are making in our company..."Caleb continues as the simulation opens displaying on the screen all kinds of jet engine parts and tools. He occasionally sneaks glances at Rodney and Director Burns. He notices how Burn grinning the whole time focused on him and very engaged.'Holy shit! I actually have her attention! Alright Caleb, keep going don't blow this. Make your girls proud.', Caleb thought internally while continuing the proposal.Little did he know that 'Director Burns' had some thoughts of her own.'UUUUGHHH so booooring. Why couldn't this guy have chosen a more fun career. Like dog breeder or a male fireman stripper? I thought after I ditched that old body in the restroom and possessed this bitch I could at least enjoy her a bit. Why'd these dweebs have to arrive do earlyyy? I couldn't even break in my new ride by diddling all her holes as per ritual. Aw well, all I need to do is find out where this guy lives and that Nightmare is good as ours!', thought Heather the ghost lady giving a menacing smile as physical body continues to grin pretending to listen to Caleb talking....5 minutes later..."And so, based on these test of we use this combination of materials and the geometry for your low-bypass turbofan blades, not ONLY would you save up to 2.5 million a year to manufacture your engines...", Caleb continues getting close to his finisher feeling extra confident since the Director as has been inthralled with him this whole time.'Ohh god I wanna die again. How is he still talking? Isn't he done yet? Jeez, why does a handsome piece of sweet chocolate like him have to be into this blah blah science science jet engine go brrrrrr crap?', Heather thought internally focusing curiously on Caleb, 'Although, I don't know what it is but he just...smells so good. I mean damn he's cute! The second I approached him I nearly jumped outta this bod to attack him. Right now I just wanna to throw him down and ride that big black cock like a rodeo bull. Yeehaw! Huhuhuhu hmm, he's STILL talking. I think I'll mess with him a bit. Give him a little show.'As Caleb was closing out he notices Director Burns unbuttoning her shirt and pushing up her breasts giving a good view of cleavage. Caleb pauses a second looking to her curiously as she looks back her head to her palm innocently listening to him and staring at him."Uh, ahem s-so anyway...um...", Caleb stutters trying to refocus his attention. Rodney gives him a concerned look wondering what was before looking to the Director surprised to see her casually resting her open D-cup cleavage on the table for them to see."Ah, excuse me, I was just feeling a bit stuffy. Please...continue Mr. Bizzell.", she spoke innocently fanning her breasts with her hand and quickly licking her lips.Rodney clenches his slacks unsure of what the hell to make of this. He then looks to Caleb motioning for him to continue.Caleb nods deciding to focus his gaze to the center of her forehead, "S-So...if as you can see from these...ahem machining specifications that..."'Hahaha, he's so nervous! What's wrong baby? You distracted? Can't decide between sticking rod D into hole A or sticking that D-rod in my A hole?', Heather thought as Caleb continues with the proposal. He turns his back facing the projector to show some turbine prototypes.' Director Burns' then leans back in her chair proceeding to kick her long, sexy legs up with a loud bang catching the boy's attention."Keep going sweety, I'm listening.", She urged caressing her own legs as Caleb and Rodney give incredulous looks. Caleb turns back around deciding to continue.She bites her lip admiring his butt beginning to rub her inner thighs together feeling heat building up in her core.Rodney looks over to the Director surprised to see her cheeks flushed and her panting slightly while staring at Caleb."Umm, Director?", Rodney spoke up as Caleb stops turning to them, "Sorry Caleb, just a minute. Ma'am are you alright?"'The Director' pauses straightening herself and clearing her throat, "Yes! Yes I'm fine. I feeling a little hot all of a sudden. I had an another appointment earlier who was sick so I hope I didn't catch anything."Rodney and Caleb give her curious looks to her.' The Director' then feels something warm and wet trickle down her leg along with a mushy sensation in her skirt."Uhhh excuse me gentleman. I'll be back in a second.", ' Burns' says hurrying out the room as fast as her high heels could allow. The second the door closes as Caleb and Rodney look to each other in confusion."Did you see that shit there?! Or am I goin crazy?", Caleb quietly screamed."If you are, I must be too man!", Rodney replied keeping his voice down."I don't know if I can finish this!", Caleb admits shaking his head and wiping away the sweat from his forehead."No no no, NO! You can do this Cal! This is just a power move! I've heard CEOs all have their weird quirks they use to psych out people like us. Come on man, you're doing great. Don't let her get in your head! We can do this! Finish strong!""Ok ok! I'll...I'll do it. Hahhh I can do it.", Caleb say taking a deep breath and exhaling....outside the room...' Burns' could be seen frantically heading to the restroom pressing her hand to her thigh."Oh, is everything alright Director Burns?", inquired a female wererabbit liminal assistant looking concerned."Yes! I just need to check something! Carry on!", 'Burns' enters the women's restroom then goes into one of the stalls. She unzips her dress skirt pulling it down to her knees.Her eyes widen upon seeing the small and medium size festering boils on her thigh with some of them leaking blood."Shit!", 'Burns' curses before her body falls against the stall as Heather ghost form halfway exits her body, "I went and let myself get too horny. This vessel can't handle my energy and it's starting to deteriorate faster than normal. She's sexy as he'll but spiritually weak as fuck! No wonder she was so easy to posses. I guess years of being lame ass business nerd with a pencil dick husband and three stupid kids weakened ya a bit huh Burns?"'Please...just let me go! I have a fam-!', begged the real voice of Burns soul from inside Heather's head."Shut it nerd! You're just lucky I need knowledge to understand a damn word those other nerds are saying. ", Heather stated silencing her before re-entering Burns body and pulling her skirt back up. She then exits the stall flinging open the one next to it.Inside was the lifeless corpse of the woman she previously possessed slumped against the wall mouth agape with eyes covered in black shadow like something out of a horror movie. 'Burns' proceeds to removes stocking from the corpse legs and grab a roll of tissue. She grabs a can of air freshener spraying a generous amount to mask to scent.'I gotta get through this lame ass meeting so I can get this guys address. I don't know how long this body will last though. Fuck! Why did he have to be such a handsome black guy with a nice ass?!', Heather screamed internally looking at Burns' face in the mirror before an idea pops in her head."Hmm, a nice ass...and body. Hihihihi.", 'Burns' chuckles to herself in the restroom....Elsewhere...Madoka and Kulah could be seen sitting inside a motel room they obtained using the formers 'human camouflage' jutsu or whatever. The ninja devil was busily surveying and jotting down notes on the fastest routes out of the city while drinking canned Green tea and eating cup ramen. Kulah lie in bed enjoying some medium rare steaks piled on a plate like snack cakes."Owmnph *munch munch* Hey? *munch* anything yet from Heather?", Kulah asks eating the steak with her bare hands licking the juices from her furry fingers and claws."No. Not since you asked me 8 seconds ago.", Madoka replied sarcastically."Ugh, what takin that spectral slut so long to send a few numbers?", Kulah groans before taking a bite out of another steak."She said she would update through text. That phone is a burner with limited call and text. So there isn't to hold her attention span. Maybe...", Madoka trailed pondering to herself.Suddenly, the door of the motel room opens getting their attention. In steps Vernal, carrying a gas station shopping bag."Sup bitches? Any word on that address?", The dark elf inquires closing the door and taking out a couple Budweisers."No. I'm guessing she hasn't texted you either.", Madoka asks."No. I was hoping you guys heard something.", the dark elf replies handing a beer to Kulah, "Maybe she's goofing off having fun with that Burns lady's body."Madoka raises an eyebrow and turns to Vernal, "Burns?""Yeah, Sasha Burns, the Director of Boeing Defense and Aerospace Center; that engineering company our target works for. She sent me a text about how sexy and firm it is and blah blah blah." , Vernal says showing her phone to Madoka who reads through the messages before looking to Vernal with horrifying realization."Vernal...the boss is a man.", Madoka says as Vernal and Kulah give her curious looks that latter raises up to listen fully , "His name's Gary Steward and he's the Director of H.O.D. Dynamics!"Kulah and Vernal jaws drop shocked by the revelation and also quite."That...DUMB bitch...", Vernal says shaking her head."For the love of Tezcatlipoca! THAT DUMBASS IS IN THE WRONG PLACE!", Kulah growled angrily crushing the half-full can with her grip."Hahhhh, alright, Vernal get to work contacting her. Let her know she's in the wrong and body.", Madoka sighs massaging the head trying to prevent a migraine."What if we can't get her?", Vernal irritability inquires."Then YOU can explain to Satella why we failed our mission because of communication issues."Vernal and Kulah feel their blood rum cold at the thought of telling Satella that Heather, and by extension THEY, fucked up."WELL DON'T JUST STAND THERE GET TO DIALING!", Kulah yells at Vernal."I'M TYPING AS FAST AS I CAN!", Vernal shouted bacl furiously tapping her phone.Madoka shakes her head in disappointment, "Why didn't I make the fox take my spot?"*generic phone notification sound*"Eh? A message?", Madoka said tapping open her phone proceeding to read the message and the other two bickered. Her eyes widen in realization, "Holy shit, it's her."Vernal and Kulah immediately turn to Madoka."Well?! What is she doing? What's her status?", Vernal inquires." She says: 'Hey bitches! Snagged the Directors bod and met that Bizzell guy. He's a nerd but kinda hot. Anyway I'm gonna possess him and send his address. Dicks and titties! Heather.' And then there's a bunch of hot dog and melon emojis.", Madoka spoke plainly and the other two girls stared blankly trying to comprehend what they just heard." THE FUCK?! HE came to HER?!", Vernal stated flabbergasted.*notification*"Oh. There's something else.", Madoka spoke opening the message before her expression becomes hollow and unamused, "It's the Director's vagina.""DAMN UNDEAD MENACE!", Kulah stated clenching her fist in irritation....Back to Caleb...'Burns' soon returns allowing Caleb to continue the proposal. She kept teasing and flashing him a bit but he kept his composure and was able to finish."Alright, Caleb.", Rodney spoke before taking over as Caleb sat back down, "So Director, given the benefits along with full cooperation by our production staff, will you consider partnering with H.O.D. Dynamics in the development of cleaner more energy efficient equipment?""Yeah alright. Let's do it.", Burns answered much to Caleb shock."Now I know there's a lot to consider and you welcome to take your time and...wait...come again?!""I said let's do it. I accept your proposal.", Burns confirms.Rodney and Caleb take a moment to fully process what they were hearing. They exchange a looks both mentally high-fiving each other in triumph."Ahem, well then Director Burns that is excellent to hear. What I have with me is an affidavit to confirm your conditional partnership with H.O.D. Dynamics along with verbal consent", Rodney says pull out some forms, "Now this states that..."While Rodney was busy going over the legal stuff, Caleb sat watching but in his mind he was jumping for joy at his first successful proposal meeting ever. He wondered what will happen now? Would he get a pay raise? Maybe promotion to a low-level position in the development ream He couldn't wait to get home and tell the girls the really good new."Ok, Director simply need your signature on these lines here.""Certainly.", She says before graciously signing the forms. Rodney politely takes them up smiling while fighting the urge to do a victory lap as well."Thank you, Director Burns. We look forward to working closely with your development team!""Haha, most definitely. Well, it was a pleasure meeting you both.", Director Burns looks to both of them lingering on Caleb, "Um, before you go, may I have a word with Mr. Bizzell. I want to speak privately about something.", she says focusing intently at Caleb.Caleb and Rodney were taken off guard by her sudden request."Oh...uhhh yeah! Yeah okay. That fine with you Caleb?", Rodney inquires looking to Caleb expectantly."Y-yes. That's fine.", Caleb answered not wanting seem indignant after all the effort they put in but still unsure.Rodney goes up to Caleb placing a hand on shoulder having a mini powwow, "Stay calm man. We have everything we need just hear her out then we'll leave.""...Alright.", Caleb reluctantly agrees as Rodney nods before leaving the room. Caleb breaths in and out. He turns around before jumping back in surprise upon meeting Burns, who was barely a foot in away, face-to-face as she smiles creepily at him.Caleb tensed her feeling a knot in his stomach upon making eye contact with Burns. Furthermore, it may have been his imagination, but he could've sworn he saw her pupils flash solid white light for a moment. Maybe it was"Oh! What's wrong young man? You look like you've seen a ghost.", She spoke in a breathy tone already making him uncomfortable. She backs up and pulls out two of the wheeled seats from the table facing them toward each other, "Please, have a seat."Caleb reluctantly does as requested much to her satisfaction....Outside the room...Rodney could be seen carrying his mini-briefcase feeling glad they were able to secure this partnership."Ah, excuse me? Where are your restrooms?", he asks a male human in business casual attire passing by."Down there, to your right.", he answered."Thanks."The man nods and continues to his own business."I got nothing. That interaction was so mundane it barely warrants 1% of my power.", came the voice Drei."Ah! What the?! Who said that?", Rodney says whipping his head around multiple times to find the source of the voice."To your top, Ace Ventura."Rodney looks up to the ceiling to see the small weasel girl closing the opening with the tile before leaping down."Oh, it's you. Why were you inside the ceiling?", Rodney inquires."I intended to survey you meeting without alarming your prospect. Unfortunately, I miscalculated the structural layout and ended up lost for a period.""That sounds rough.", Rodney expressed."Actually, I found it oddly pleasant. The cramped, cool darkness becomes cozy after some adjustments. I started considering living here...as a ceiling hermit. Even found a good water source and made twin bed out of insulation.", Drei explained as a thought bubble appeared of herself sleeping curled with her tail on said insulation bed as Rodney wasn't sure how to respond to that.Sidebar: Her weasel instincts kicked in."Where is Mr. Bizzell?", Drei inquires."He's still in there with the Director.", Rodney answeredDrei raises an eyebrow, "Why?""I don't know. After she agreed to our proposal, she wanted to speak with Caleb privately.", Rodney answered, "Frankly, I really didn't want to leave him in there alone. The Director was acting so strange.""Strange how?", Drei asks getting her attention.Rodney looks around make sure no one was listening and whispers, "Like...she just casually showing her cleavage just doing these inappropriate...kind sexual things. And she seemed REALLY focused on Caleb."The fur on Drei's tail stands on end before she turns a heading to the Directors office, "...I'm going in.""Wait! You can't just barge in. That's her office.", Rodney stated."Only on paper.", Drei comments about to turn the nob."HYYAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!", came a loud screams getting their attention. They then see a human female worker hysterically running out from around a corner where the rest rooms were.She was then followed by another female human, "OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD!"Rodney and Drei were taken aback to hear that. Soon other workers showed up to try and assess the situation and calm down the female employees."Hey! HEY! Calm down! What's wrong?!", Stated a grey furred male Werecat in business casual attire."THERE'S A FUCKING DEAD WOMAN IN THE STALL! THAT'S WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG!", one of the women screamed as the other sobbed violently being comforted by a male and female employee. Two male employees enter the restroom.Drei looks back at the door before running over to the group head to the bathroom as the two men exit visibly shaken by what they saw."Whoa Whoa! Little girl you can't go in there! Yo, who's kid is this?!", one of the men stated looking around frantically."I'm 22 and a MON agent.", Drei says showing her badge and glaring up seriously at the taller man, "If you're done making fun of my dwarfism, you can call security and an ambulance.", she says before. entering the restroom."Well, you heard her, go get security!", the man who unintentionally insulted her stated to the Werecat male runs down the hall with haste passing a stunned Rodney who then decides to join the group as the two women continued to sob attracting the attention of more employees who join the scene and quickly filled in on what happened. Barely 2 minutes later Drei exits the restroom; her eyes closed in thought." ...what the hell's going on?!", Rodney inquires as the other workers listen intently.Drei sighs, "After examining her body, there don't appear to be any wounds indicating signs of a struggle so that rules out murder. Whatever wounds that are on her body are similar to that of a body undergoing necrosis. Yet, given it's state of her body she appears two have died roughly 3 hours ago. It's as if...she had became a corpse before she died."Rodney along with the workers look to her in surprise and confusion."Did any of you know her?", Drei asks the group."I never seen her around here before.", a male human works says as the other workers expressed the same opinion."W-Wait! I-I-I-I remember seeing someone that..looked just like her.", one of the women who first found the body says, "S-She was a...I think she was applying for a job or something with Director Burns."Drei eyes widen in realization, "Director Burns.""Hey!", came an unknown male voice. Drei along with the others in the group look to see two security guards coming down the hall with the Werecat leading them."What's this about a dead body in the women's rest-"The man is cut off when the door to Burns' offices goes flying open with a slam surprising everyone....inside Burns' office...12 minutes ago...Caleb sat in front of Burns unsure of what to say as she stares at him pensively."Uhh Director Burns-", Caleb started but Burns cuts him off"You know, you really sold me on that plan of yours Mr. Bizzell. Incorporating materials from other liminal cultures into the design of our is quite innovative. How'd you come up with that?", She inquires in a professional tone."Oh, well...I heard some time ago that the U.S. recently began trading new materials from liminal nations. The Dragonkin like the Ryu-Jin supplying are metric tons of dragonvein ore which Boston Dynamics implemented in some of their projects because of its thermal resistant and strength-to-ductility properties after quenching-", Caleb explained."Ok, ok! I get it Mr. Bizzell you've done your homework.", Burns smiles and laughs off.Caleb was surprised but began to feel a bit more at ease even cracking a smile."We need people like you. People that see how much the world is changing with liminals in our lives. Hell, I have several employed here. Plus, with this new bill coming soon we'll be able to marry them and eventually...breeding with them will seem...common place...natural.", Burn says in a oddly sensual tone leaning close to Caleb to his surprise.Caleb gulps, "Y-Yeah, hopefully.""You know something else, I saw how my assistant looked at you when you first entered my office. She seemed a bit infatuated with you.", Burns says moving closer to him."O-Oh...yeah that's...kinda tough to explain...", Caleb spoke before she lays both hand to his knees. He looks up to her lustful getting an eye full of D-cup cleavage, "W-W-What are you-?!"Burns silences with a finger to his lips, "Tell ya the truth, I can tell why she was excited. You smell good. And you taste...", She removes her finger from his lip placing it in her mouth sucking on it to his shock before she leans closer with a look hunger and whispers, "Delicious."Caleb froze in shock at the situation then feels her hand moving up his thigh then hook her finger to his belt as she licks her lips. He then grabs her wrist just tight enough to stop her to her and pulls it away."Stop.", he says in deep tone before throwing her hand back and pushes her away by the shoulders, "Whatever you think this is it NEEDS to stop!"Burns gives him a surprised look before shifting gears, "Hey, come on, your sure you want to pass on this? Don't worry, you won't get in trouble for just having a little taste. Consider it a benefit of our...partnership.", She says lifting her skirt showing her panties in her black tights as Caleb turns away wiping his face in exasperation."Ok, nope. Uh uh, this ain't happenin'.", Caleb says raising from his seat before.."HYAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"A terrified scream could be heard from outside the room startling Caleb. Ms. Burns looks toward the door clenching her teeth in irritation.'Shit! Looks like somebody finally found it. Ugh, and he's not even trying to give in. Guess I'll have to be more actively persuasive.', Heather thought with a malicious smirk."What the hell was that?!", Caleb stated jumping up from his chair going to the door.'Burns' stops him getting in his way, "Hey, hey! ~Don't worry about that big man. This is about you and me.""Are you serious?! Somebody could be hurt or in danger and my supervisor out there!", Caleb urges trying to leave before Burns stops him grabbing his shoulder."If you really care about him you'd hear me put. Or do you want me to reconsider our partnership?"Caleb pauses in shock at her threat before discretely taking out his phone, "What do you WANT from me lady?""~You know what I want.~", Burns says rubbing his crotch making him tense up then cupping under his chin, "~And what I want I get~""I knew you were acting weird when we got here.""What can I say, imma thirsty bitch.", She says going in for a wet kiss.'That's it, let me in.', Heather spoke internally as Burns eyes begin to glaze over white."Well you ain't getting it from me! He seen how you were acting since we got here too and now I have more to share with him and anybody else here!", Caleb says showing his phone that was finished recording much to Burns' shock. He walks up to her glaring coldly, "Everything our company has is on the table...except me. I'm just a middle man, nothing more. Now, for both our sake, I'm gonna walk out that door and pretend this never happened. I suggest you do the same. Understand?"Director Burns pauses a moment before grinning and lightly chuckling then transitioning to hearty laughter. Caleb looks at her with confusion."What's so funny?!""Hahaha haaa you are. You are something else hehe. I was hoping we could do this the easy way. But I also like it rough.", Burns spoke before kneeing Caleb in the stomach as hard as she could in the stomach."AAGHH! OHMP!", Caleb hunches over groaning in pain before the Director does a windup slapping him hard across the face making him land on his back bumping his head to the hard anolium floor."WOO! Now we're cookin!", Burns whooped shaking her hand off before leaping in Caleb pinning then proceeding to choke him with one hands smiling widely. Caleb gags gripping her wrist trying to pry himself from her iron-like grip finding she was alot stronger than she looked. She reaches into her skirt pulling out a metal fountain pen, "Scream for baby."' Burns' stabs him in his thigh with the pen making him holler out but was strained from her still choking him. She smiles as her eyes and mouth take on a haunting white glow positioning over his face. Caleb stares back in horror and, in panic, he teleports from under her to her surprise. He coughs a bit hastily getting to his feet. He pulls the pen out of his thigh throwing it away before running over to the door flinging it open like a madman....Present..."SOMEBODY GET THIS CRAZY BITCH AWAY FROM ME-AH!", Caleb screams running out getting everyone's attention before being tackled from behind to the ground by the Director."CALEB!", called out as Drei pushes past the crowd.'Burns' flips Caleb over grabbing his throat and straddling him. Caleb looks up horrified by her wicked smile and patches of skin on her face appears to be peeling off. She grabs his cheeks."You're mine now.", 'Burns' purred before forcefully kissing gouging his throat with her tongue as the security guards, Rodney, and everyone else look on in shock at the scene. Her eyes and mouth glow with white light as a stream of glowing whitish-blue steam-like substance forcefully pours into Caleb mouth and eyes. His body convulses violently as the last bit of the substance leaves Burns body as she gasps violently eyes darting around in confusionDrei suddenly comes lunges at high speed tackling the Director off of Caleb. She brandished her small blades holding them to the Directors throat. Then looks to Caleb who was coughing trying to catch his breath."What did you do?! What did you do to him-", Drei demanded before noticing the woman trembling violently with an unfocused gaze. She gets off her seeing the strange wounds on her face and arms. Similar to the ones on the dead girl's body in the restroom. She's approached by one of the security guards who kneels down trying to process the sight."A-a...d...nt le...her...nn...hgg...", Burns utters as her breath becomes shallow. Drei listens trying to make out what she's saying but Burns soon passes out."Call an ambulance. We need an ambulance NOW!", the security guard told his associate who does as instructed."Caleb!", Rodney stated running over to Caleb helping sit him up against the wall. Calebs eyes dart around before landing on Rodney, "Are you alright man?!"Caleb catches his breath then winces at searing pain in his right thigh coming from the wound where he was bleeding a little and instinctively holds it."H-Holy shit man you're bleeding. Somebody get a first aid kit!", Rodney says in shock upon seeing the blood on Caleb's hand. One of the male works quickly goes to find one, "What happened in there man?""Agh, we were talking, she tried to...seduce me and then she..attacked me.", Caleb replies turning to the woman lying on the floor as other workers closed in."Now you hold on! I've worked for Ms. Burns for 7 years and she's one of the most even the most easygoing I ever met and she's married with a husband and children. What you saying just don't add up now!", The security guard stated looking at Caleb skeptically."If you think I'm lying, listen to this.", Caleb says proceeding to take out his phone and play the recording. The guard and the employees looked shocked after it was done."T-That can't be Director Burns. She would never behave that way", one of the female workers says."Well, she was acting strange the entire time during our meeting.", Rodney pointed out"No, no...no this doesn't make any sense...", The security guards says touching his forehead"Well ask her yourself!", Caleb stated in irritation."He can but I doubt he'll get answer.", Drei spoke before turning to them with a serious expression, "She just died."The weight of this news hit everyone on different levels. Caleb himself was torn in how he should feel but was still shaken by the fact that someone just died right next to him.'Hehehehehehehehe...', came the voice of someone giggling that caught Caleb's attention making him look around for the source....a few hours later...Police and ambulance were called in to deal with the bodies of the woman in the bathroom, later identified as Vicky Shine who apparently went missing in Cullman nearly a week ago, and Director Burns. The news shook the staff in the entire facility none of them could believe what happened. Being the last ones to see her alive, Caleb and Rodney were heavily questioned by the police but especially Caleb who they were very suspicious even a bit rude toward him since he was completely alone with her prior to her apparent meltdown. Luckily, the recording he had was sufficient enough to prove he was not directly involved in her death. However, it didn't shake the questions concerning the Directors death; especially the strange wounds on her and Vicky Shine bodies.Caleb and Rodney were eventually allowed to leave while not labeling them as suspects...for now. The two were forced to return to their firm where news of Directors death had somehow already leaked out. Both of them had to explain to their boss what happened and their "involvement" in the incident. Not wanting to attract negative attention from news outlets, their boss had no other option but to suspend them both until things die down. It was a crushing blow to their morale but it was better than the alternative.Right now, both of them were speaking with the other members of their development team in the break room."So what? That's it?!", Clay stated incredulously."Fraid' so...yeah.", Rodney answers plainly as Caleb listens silently with a plain expression."What the hell?! There's not even proof you guys were involved!", Rachel stated outraged raising shooting up shaking the table, "If anything, from what you say, the Director...", she trails realizing the circumstance."Even so, we were with the director. Thanks to Cal's quick thinking with that video, we aren't in handcuffs right now. Only for now we're not suspects and Mr. Steward realizes that. He doesn't want the risk the news folks coming here spinning whatever bullshit they can besides what really happened. Then there's was the other dead woman in the restroom...that's too many questions and very little answers.", Rodney replied as the others in the group went silent still displeased with the idea."So...how long are you guys suspended for?", A hazel haired man inquires."Well Zeke, for me, given my Lead position, I can only stay off for two weeks.", Rodney says before his gaze turns melancholic, "As for Caleb, because due to the circumstances surrounding the Director...he's been suspended indefinitely until Mr. Steward deems it ok for him to return. Also, we both have to leave early today. "Caleb clenches his pant leg under the table still silent. Rachel's the others jaw drop at hearing that."The fuck?!", Rachel exclaims joined by the others who voice their discontent with the news."Hey hey! Come on listen!", Rodney stated trying to settle them down."Are YOU listening to yourself?! How is exactly is that even remotely fair?", Clay stated."I agree!", Rachel joins in, "How does that make any sense for him to be suspended for way longer than you? Is Steward afraid he'll draw way more attention than you or something?""Look, it's not like...well...that is a small part of it but...", Rodney trails trying to properly articulate but not finding the right words."It's just easier to suspend an entry-level worker, right?", Raj interjects, "They want to reduce the financial and production losses that would be much higher for worker like us with Mid to Senior status compare to an entry level level like Caleb. ""Is that true Rodney?", Rachel asks.Rodney hesitates a second, "Yes...when you get down to it, it's just basic dollars and cents. Him being out of the news light is a bonus.""Ok, we need to talk to Gary about this. This is just...", Clay says crossing his arms as Jack nods in agreement."Definitely! If we all go in at once I'm sure-", Rachel agrees getting cut off"Guys!", Caleb stated getting their attention, "It's alright."Rodney and the others look to each other in confusion and surprise."What do you mean it's alright? You can seriously be ok with this.", Rachel spoke in disbelief."Of course not! But I understand. Trust me, things can get much worse if the media digs their nails into this place. I'd rather not put everyone through that. Besides, I work partly I'll still be getting paid weekly during my time off, at 55% my usual pay but still, I'll be alright.", Caleb assures them as he looks through his bag finding the black bento box Rikka made him and taking it out. He opens it up revealing a beautiful assortment of vegetables, a small omelet, smoked salmon rolls, and two orange rice balls shaped like cat paws."Whoa, that looks awesome! Where'd you get it?", Jack asks."Rikka from accounting made it for me. I think I'll try it now.", Caleb answers about to dig inThe others look to Rodney who shrugs unsure how to respond."How can you think of eating right now?!", Rachel says incredulously, "You realize things aren't the best right now for you and any other liminal host here. Once everyone learns about your involvement in Director's death...these asshole anything to get you fired from here-""RACHEL!", Caleb shouted in irritation glaring at her, "I don't wanna hear that. I am hungry and I'm going to have lunch before I leave. I won't see any of y'all for God knows how long after that, so please...let me just have this. Please?", his voice cracks a bit near the end.Rachel could sense the pain in his voice deciding not to press further and neither did the others"Sure man.", Rodney spoke understandingly as the others agreed.Caleb tries on of the smokes salmon rolls savoring the taste as his eyes become water, "Heh...it's good.""Really?...Mind if I try one?", Rachel asks."Sure.", Caleb let's her have one as she pops it into her."Oh, ah damn this so good! It just melts in my mouth.", Rachel croons."Bet that's not the only meat that melts in your mouth.", Caleb spoke as Rodney and the others give him a strange lool. It was then Caleb realizes what he said."Excuse me?!", Rachel stated surprised."Whooaa, there man.", Jack adds."I-I'm sorry! Sorry Rachel. I have...I have no idea why I said that.", Caleb says rubbing his forehead."I'll let it slide but that was a bit over the line.", Rachel chides."I know. I'm sorry.", Caleb apologizes again."Maybe leave sex jokes to professionals there bud.", Clay says."Maybe you should rethink your career cuz your joke fall flatter then the Wii U.", Rachel remarks"Maybe you should rethink that potato clock on wheels you call a car", Clay retorts."Maybe you should rethink that suit. You look like Jack Skeleton going to prom.""I'm almost gonna miss this.", Rodney spoke under his breath while they continued.As those two bickered, Caleb looks down thoughtfully trying to enjoy his lunch not understanding why he would say something like that.'Huhuhuhuhu cuz she's got a nice rack riiiight?'Caleb flinched when heard that voice again his eyes dart around a moment."Hm? You ok man?", Rodney noticing him jump."Yeah just...coughed. It's a bit spicy.", Caleb assures holding a cat rice bun. Rodney gives a slightly concerned look before letting it go.'Huhuhuhuhuhu', laughed the unknown voice again as if taunting Caleb."Haaa...i'm going crazy.", Caleb thought coldly continuing to eat his food.After finishing up in the breakroom, the rest of the development team saw Caleb and Rodney off with Rodney appointing Raj in charge of things for now. The two silently made their way out of the building ignoring the gossiping whispers of their coworkers. They at the entrance to the lower parking deck when Caleb notice Rodney stopped following him."Aren't you comin'? ""Not yet. I just remembered there's a couple things I need to take care of.", Rodney answered."Ah...alright guess I'll see you.", Caleb spoke his voice a little hollow turning to walk away."Hey, Caleb?", Rodney calls him as he turns to his supervisor, "You did a great job with the proposal, all things considered. You're a good man AND a good engineer...just wanted you to know that.", he finishes offer his hand to CalebCaleb pauses a second before clasping the man's hand, "Thanks...not 100% on all that but thanks. Heh, hell of a first meeting huh?""None of that was your fault Caleb. You have to believe that.", Rodney assures."Ok.", Caleb spoke."We'll keep you updated on everything going on.""Alright.", Caleb says as his supervisor nods, "Oh, but can you do me a solid?""Sure man."Caleb whispers something in his ear."Alright, I'll do it on my way up "Caleb nods then turns exiting the sliding doors as Rodney watches him for a momentAs he approachas his car, Caleb could see Drei sitting atop the the trunk waiting patiently for him. He looks at her a moment but doesn't say anything as her unlocks the car doors putting his bag in the backseat."I see they're letting you off early today.", Drei spoke.Caleb looks to her a moment, "Yeah, well, I got suspended. This stuff with Director Burns...they don't wanna attract that negative publicity here. it's best I leave before the wildfire spreads even more.""Are you ok?", Drei inquires looking to him"I'll live.", Caleb says plainly as her close the back door opening the driver door."How's your leg?", She asks"Much better. Thanks again for patching me up.", Caleb says before stepping in the car and starting the ignition.Drei the knocks on her window making him roll it down, "Hey...do you feel...alright? Any fever, nausea, or any kind of fatigue?""Drei, considering the afternoon events I'm pretty fucking far from alright. But no, no fever or nausea, I am tired though.", Caleb answersDrei gives an inquisitive but understanding look, "Ok...I...I'm gonna tail you the way home.""That's fine.", Caleb responds not even looking at her.She nods before a small breeze blows and she vanishes leaving Caleb alone. He sighs gripping the steering wheel wanting to scream as loud as he could until his head explodes but couldn't muster up the will to do so. He notices the aux cord still plugged in and yanks it out uncaringly tossing in the back before pulling out of the parking lot....Inside, Rodney could be seen head to the elevators. One of the opens up and somebody quickly comes running out. It was Rikka the Nekomata from accounting. She then notices Rodney."Y-You! You work with Mr. Bizzell right? Is it true?! Has he been fired?!", Rikka stated in a very concerned tone."What? No! Who told you that?", Rodney replies."I heard from a group in my department. T-They said he was fired because of what happened with Director Burns and-""Let me stop you right there, don't believe whatever B.S. rumors going around. He wasn't fired he was SUSPENDED just like me. Huge difference.", Rodney corrected."For how long?!", Rikka inquired."2 weeks for me. Not sure for him. Mr. Steward will have final say on that.""W-Well is he still here?! I want to speak with him before he leaves!", Rikka asks."He...actually left a minutes ago. Sorry.", Rodney tells her.Rikka cast her gave downwards tails and ears drooping sadly, "Oh...""But, hey! He actually wanted me to tell you, he thought your bento was delicious and would love to have another some time.", Rodney informs as the Nekomata looks to him hopefully ears perking up, "I guess he really likes your cooking."Rikka cheeks become rosy as a small grin crosses her lips, "...I didn't believe them.""What?""What they were saying about Mr. Bizzell. He's a kind person, I could see it in his eyes. I know he would never do something like that.", Rikka affirms."It's nice of you to say that.", Rodney says with an appreciative smile."And...um...i-if It's not too much trouble, could you tell him...i'll be waiting with another bento box just for him when he returns.", She spoke happily."Heh, I'll be sure to.", Rodney smirks, "You know, I COULD give you his cell number so you can tell him personally.""EH?! N-No! That's-! I mean-!", Rikka stutters in embarassment."I'm kidding! I don't give out my team's personal cells like that.", Rodney says walking past her to the elevator and he presses the button."Ah! R-right. Of course."The elevator doors open and he steps inside."Buuut I may have to if someone from accounting needs to call him for advising", Rodney says loud enough for her to hear.Rikka ears perk up turning heading to the elevator , "Wait, what?! A-Am I allow-""Sorry, can't hear ya, doors closing!", Rodney cuts off as the doors close leaving the Nekomata alone with her thoughts....back to Caleb...Caleb could be seen heading down his usual route to get to his street whilst passing several stores and building. There was an unusual amount of traffic today, so he was held up a few times at the stop light. He didn't mind and honestly wanted to take his time getting home today....However, he wasn't the only one.'Hmm, alright so he really doesn't live that far from where he works. That makes things easier.', Heather says within the back of Caleb's mind while viewing everything through his eyes, 'Still, that makes ONE thing that's easy. What is up with this guy's psyche?! He should be under my control by now but I can barely even see what's in his head!'It's true. From the moment Heather possessed him, she had been working her through his subconscious attempting to overwhelm his psyche by bombarding with endless lewd thoughts while devouring and weakening his spirit energy as she does with all her victims.However, what she, didnt know was that Caleb's is mind invaded in constantly invades by his Nightmare girlfriend and every time it leaves behind small amounts of astral energy within his subconscious that have condensed into metaphysical energy pockets. This surplus energy has not only assisted in him better controlling his dreamscape but has also strengthened his mental control and increased his spirit energy thresholds.As a result, he was now much more resistant to mind control and possession than a normal human.'Tch, what a pain. I don't know how he's able to resist me but I know he can't keep this up. I'll just need to increase the pressure until he cracks. Hehehe, he's actually making me TRY!.', Heather smirks as her body is enraptured in a black and green miasma.Outside, Caleb comes to another stop at a red light looking ahead at the right turn to his street. Drei could be seen stealthily following from above hovering on a tiny whirlwind a her feet.. The light turns green and Caleb meanders forward turning his wheel'I WISH I COULD'VE STUCK IT IN THAT BITCH BEFORE SHE KICKED THE BUCKET!'A voice sounding like his shouted in his mind accompanied by images of Burns naked and him fucking her on the meeting table.Caleb eyes shot open in shock hitting he breaks instinctively as a large black Toyota truck comes barreling his way. Drei's eyes shot open in shock. Before it could ram into his driver's side, Caleb steps his foot on the gas just barely avoiding a collision as cars blare their horns at him."GET OFF THE STREET, STUPID MOTHERFUCKER!", the truck driver yelled out from the passenger window.Caleb heart was racing and breathing heavily as he tried to collect his nerves while continuing down the street. Why would he THINK something like that?! What is wrong with him?!Above Drei could be seen pursuing him with a troubled look on her face.'Hahahahahaaa! That was AWESOME! Way to keep your cool there man!', Heather laughed heartily slapping her "knee" before noticing he was slowing down before turning into a driveway, "Oh, guess we're at your house. Nice place. Hmmm and it looks like your reckless driving shook those nerve a bit. Huhuhuhuuu Nowwww the real fun begins.'Caleb puts the car in park before taking the keys from the ignition. He exhaustedly puts his forehead to his palm sighing heavily to collect himself. He then years a knock at the driver window and looks to see Drei stand in front of his door.He opens it a steps out without a word."Mind telling me what THAT was about?", Drei inquires with her arms crossed like a mother scolding a child."I...I-I don't know just being careless I guess.", Caleb half-heartedly answers before opening the backseat grabbing his bag."I've seen you drive. You're a safer driver than Ein and SHE made notes on herself during the driving test. That there was very out of character you.", Drei replies looking to him studying his movements, "Are you sure you're alright?""Yes. Haaa...maybe I was just distracted by...there is ALOT on my mind right now.", Caleb say closing the doors and locking them with the keys.Drei gives him a skeptical look, "Are you having strange feelings? Paranoia? Confusion? Nausea? Does your body or throat ache at all?""Where did all this come from?!", Caleb replies incredulously, "Look, I'm fine! I just wanna rest right now. Ok?"'Yeah, shut it ya little runt!', Heather chided from back of his mind watching through his eyes."Ok bu-", Drei started but was quickly cut off when the front door goes flying open."Chief's home!", Lyca stated happily running up to him with big smile and tail wagging excitedly.'Oooh who's this happy little furry wet dream?'"Hey Lyca...", Caleb says putting on a smile for her and petting her lead. She tilts her noticing his tone of voice."Is something wrong, Chief?""Just...a little tired. Today really knocked the wind outta me. I'll explain inside, ok?", Caleb says giving an assuring smile ."Ok.", Lyca replied smiling but still noticeably concerned as she follows him inside.Drei follows as well keeping a safe distance from Caleb deciding to closely monitor him for now.They step inside closing the door.'*whistle* Damn it's even better inside! That's what's she said, HA! But seriously this guy's done pretty well for himself.', Heather spoke from the back of his head astonished."Hey Boss! Hey sis! How was today's mission?", Zwei spoke waving to them from the couch while play Apex Legends on his tv.'Whoa, he's got one who looks that little green Asian cat kid's older and taller and more fun sister. Nice body too like that ass.', Heather spoke with a hungry smirk."Ah Bienvenido a casa, señor(Welcome home)!", Camilla stated smiling warmly as she approached him."Hey Camilla.", Caleb greeted.'HOLY SHIT IT'S A THICC MEXICAN GIRL SATAN!', Heather stated her jaw dropping, 'Look at those TITS! They're as big as this guy's head!'"Ju are home early. I was just in the middle of picking up where we left off in this story. I'm getting better pronouncing adjectives.", Camilla says proudly showing the light novel he got for her from Kami House."That's great to hear, hun. I love seeing you being proactive.", Caleb said with forced smile.Camilla sees the exhaustion in his eyes, "Is something wrong Senor?"Zwei looks to him curiously after Lyca finishes whispering something to her."Not...entirely. Hey, where's Moon pie at? I...we need to tell you about what happened today.", Caleb says looking to Drei briefly."Oh she's in your office reading that 100 kanojo manga on your computer.", Zwei said."Can you get her please?", Caleb asks.Zwei pauses the game putting the controller down while getting up, "Sure Boss.""Thanks.", he says before rubbing his eyes still wondering the best way to relay all this to them. Camilla gives him a concerned look."Señor, would ju like some food or perhaps something to drink.", Camilla spoke wanting to help him relax."Diet Dr. Pepper is fine, if you don't mind.", Caleb replies."Not at all, mi Amor(my love).", She spoke lovingly."Thank you", Caleb says before Camilla leans in for a kiss which he accepts much to Drei's slight concern. Camilla then goes to the kitchen her hips swaying.'THICC LATINA BOOTY!', Heather stated drooling lecherously watching her leave.Suddenly, the front door open and in steps Ein coming from her and her sister's house next door."Hello Mr. Bizzell, you're back early.", Ein greeted before closing the door."Hey Ein, yeah Camilla said the same thing.", Caleb replies as the ghost girl within him eyes widen upon seeing Ein's assets.'HE'S GOT ANOTHER ONE! AND THIS ONE'S A THICC, BIG TITTIED ASIAN CAT?! THIS GUYS A MAN OF CULTURE!', Heather screamed madly before noticing something, 'Wait. She kinda looks like those other two cat girls. IS THIS THEIR MOM?! HE'S GOT A BIG TITTIED CAT MILF?!'"Ah. Is there a particular reason for that?", Ein inquires curiously."Yes. Yes there is.", Caleb says plainly moving around the couch plopping down on it. Ein was about to inquire further but Drei pulls at her hem getting her attention."We'll get into that soon. In the meantime, watch him closely for anything out of character."Ein wasn't sure what was going on but she trusted her sister and decided to do as advised.Caleb sighs lethargically at the comfortable cushions against his back as he look up at the ceiling. Lyca sits down next to him proceeding nuzzle herself against his chest lovingly. A small grin crosses his lips beginning to strokes her soft ears as she cooed sweetly her tails happily beating against the couch.'Awww, a stud and his lap dog. Ya wanna big juicy hotdog there Lassie? Yeah, I know you do.', Heather smirk as her green and black miasma flares, 'Why not have a taste?'Caleb unconsciously unzips his pants proceeding to reach his pinky and ring finger inside. Lyca notices the action."Eh? Do you have an itch down there Chief?"Caleb raises an eyebrow an eye wondering what she meant before looking down in shock."What the-?! No! No, sorry I don't know why I was...", Caleb stated hastily zipping himself back up confused as to why he suddenly trying to touch himself, "Just... ignore that. I Ok?"'Bahahahahaha! Smooooooth.', Heather laughed sarcastically praising him, 'More importantly, looks like my influence is getting stronger.'Lyca tilts her head humming thoughtfully at his odd behavior. Ein watches with an inquisitive look unsure if this is the kind of thing her sister meant."Here, Senor."Caleb looks behind him to see a ice filled glass of Diet Dr. Pepper shrouded in blue energy levitating over his head down in front of him. He takes it nodding appreciatively before enjoying the cool, sweet fizzy beverage already feeling his nerves relax.'Bleh! He likes DIET pop? Sick!', Heather thought sticking her tongue in disgust."Hey, she'll here in a minute finishing up a chapter.", Zwei says coming from the hallway."Ok.", Caleb responds looking back at the weasel before noticing Drei pull her aside whispering something in her ear while keeping her from looking at Caleb. He raises an eyebrow.'Hmm, wonder what they're talking abou-.', Heather spoke in the back of his mind before Mirabelle suddenly teleports into the living room starting, 'WAH! What the fuck?!'"Welcome home, Dear! You back ea-""Yeah, I'm back early. Already heard it twice now babe.", Caleb stops her as she gives him a curious look. Within the back of his mind, Heather eyes widen upon finally seeing her team's true target.'Hollllly shit. I almost forgot why I was here. So this is what it looks like...The Nightmare.'"Is that right?", Mirabelle spoke approaching him as Camilla took a seat next to him on the couch, "Well I'd rather not keep repeating it like a record and instead ask my darling husband how his day was."'Wow, she's so beautiful, acquiescent, proper, and...purple...I don't like herrr-WHOA WHOA HANG ON! Back up! Did she say... HUSBAND?! He's MARRIED to this thing?! Oh this just gets better!'"Well...today was a hell of a trial. I don't where the hell to start.", Caleb says using the half-empty glass to cool his head as Mirabelle and the others give him a worried looks."Tell us all about it Dear. Do not skip on any detail you feel is important.", Mirabelle says encouragingly draping her arms around his neck resting her chin his shoulder while nudging her soft cheek to his. He looks to Camilla to her right and Lyca to his left and the Zyklons on their usual spot."Alright. Everyone's here, may as well get started.", Caleb says before downing the glass of soda in one go.Heather smirks deciding to use this opportunity to focus on building up her energy. Reliving today's trauma should weaken his psyche a bit. When that happens......40 minutes later..."So yeah...that's where we're at now.", Caleb says having finished telling the girls everything that happened today. From his and Rodneys meeting with Director Burns to him being suspended from work indefinitely.The girls, save for Drei, look to him with utter shock at what he's been through today."Bloody hell...", was all Mirabelle say."S-So what? You're both currently suspected of murdering the Director?!", Zwei stated in disbelief."Pay attention! He just said that he wasn't under suspicion for the time being.", Ein clarifies then looks to Caleb, "And that's only because of that recording. Quick thinking by the way, sir.""This day and age Ein, espescially for somebody like me, it's basic instinct to cover ones ass any way possible.", Caleb says leaning forward elbows to his knees, "Still no matter how much I play it in my head, nothing about it makes sense.""Perhaps but what does make sense is that filthy punta (whore) tried to seduce and KILL ju.", Camilla pointed out her arms and legs crossed sounding a bit agitated , "Defending yourself was Señor best option.""Right, but like Drei said there was something wrong with her just like with the one in the restroom. They were both victims of some unknown affliction.", Ein says"Hmph, calling them victims implies they were innocent to begin with. They WERE humans after all. Perhaps this is Discords way of disposing of them.", Camilla scoffs dismissively as the others look to her in slight disappointment or surprise."That's pretty harsh.", Zwei says."I agree! That's no way talk about people you didn't even KNOW Ms. Sartana! They could have good women.", Ein objected."In public. Who knows who they truly were away from the eyes they put masks on for. Is it really coincidence both of them experience the same fate at the same time? Whatever the case, it doesn't matter to me.", Camilla retorted closing her eyes with serious tone as Ein gives an incredulous look."Camilla.", Mirabelle says in disbelief."Even if that's a possibility, that's still no way talk!", Ein stated glaring at Camilla who glares back with equal intensity."Whatever. Señor is fine. That is ALL I care about.", Camilla averts her gaze stubbornly."Oh yes! So much that you refuse to even-!", Ein was about to start with the She-devil."Girls!", Caleb interjected as the two turn their attention to him, "Not today. Ok?"Camilla and Ein look to him then to each other both feeling ashamed for doing this in front of him."Los siento(I'm sorry), Señor.", Camilla apologizes sincerely."My apologies, sir.", Ein spoke shamefully."I'm already feeling terrible as is. Can't go back into the office for who knows how long. Probably when the media gets tired of it. I mean...FIRST meeting I ever have and I not only lose a partnership worth thousands but the client DIES right next to me! This must be some kinda joke. Steward never should've pick to do that.", Caleb spoke coldly slouching forward looking down covering his face in exasperation. Lyca and Camilla touch his back trying to comfort him.'~Huhuhuhuhu~', came that voice again. Caleb's eyes widen and terrible knot forms in his stomach.Mirabelle teleports in front of him before kneeling down to eye level. Her soft purple gaze into his devotedly as she smiles warmly at him, "Dear...it'll be alright. Please don't blame yourself. You did your absolute best and that's far more than I believe they needed.""Moon pie..."Mirabelle reaches to caress his face when...*Slap*To, the others, and even Caleb's surprise, he roughly slaps her hand making her elicit a pained yelp at the action. Drei immediately raises up. Caleb eyes widen in shock at his action."Ah!", Mirabelle looks to him confused and hurt rubbing her hand."Chief? W-Why did you do that?", Lyca asks as he looks to her unsure what to say."Señor?"He looks to them before getting a splitting headache clenching his head in pain as images of him sexually assault, beat, or choking the three of them bombarded him. He shoots to his feet heart races as he breaths heavily."D-Dear?! What's wrong?!", Mirabelle stated deeply worried and confused as the other two felt the same. Drei and her sisters look to him intently as if deciding their next action.'Huhuhuhu, someone's in trouble.', the voice taunted him"I...I...I...", Caleb couldn't find the words that could answer. Only thing he knew was he had to get away from them. Now, "I'll be in my room! *zoom*"Caleb stated before teleporting to his room. The girls look to each other questioningly.Drei steps up, "I think you all fully understood the situation"Mirabelle and the others look to her curiously....In Caleb's room...'Ya know, I'm very curious about that teleporting thing.', taunted the voice.Caleb could be seen rapidly pace around his room then proceeding to rake off his clothes starting to feel stuffy in his dress shirt and pants.'~oooh yeah baby, take it off!', came that voice again which sent a chill through his nerves.He throws his clothes away grabbing a some black jogging pants and purple t-shirt before plopping his butt on the bed trying the calm down. His heart feeling like it's going to burst out his chest and wiping away his forehead sweat."Why did I do that? Why would do that to Moon pie?", Caleb spoke despairingly wiping his hand over his head.'Maybe that horse bitch should mind her own business. GOD I JUST WANNA SMACK THE SHIT OUTTA HER SOMETIMES!', a voice screams in his head."Gahhh, no! That's not true!", Caleb spoke clenching his head.'SAME FOR THAT CLINGY DOG AND THE SLUTTY DEVIL!'"NOO!", Caleb called out clenching his eyes as bloody, grisly images of him harming the girls bombarded his mind.'Huhuhuhu, come on they belong to you, right? Meaning you can do whatever you want with them, RIGHT?!', the voice spoke sweetly but coating in venom."Shut up shut up shut up!", Caleb denounced shaking his head before pulling the droor of his nightstand almost knocking down the land and frantically searching through pulling everything until he found it. A small prescription medicine bottle. He looks at it a moment saddened he had to rely on these again. He was doing so well managing his nerves up until now...in the middle of a nervous breakdown.'Oooh, what's this? Somebody needs their crazy pills?'He ignores the voice teleports into the bathroom in front of the sink with the pill bottle in hand. He turns on the sink then opens the bottle tapping out two small white tablets. He open his mouth about to down them before noticing his something strange about his reflection. While his left hand was on the counter and his right hand held the pills...the reflections left hand was in his pocket. He blinks a couple times making sure he was seeing right. He leans in closer to the mirror staring at the reflection when..."BOO!", The reflection stated quickly morphing into Heather's true form."AH!", Caleb screams out knocking the pill bottle off the counter scattering them to floor as he backs away before an unknown force stops him. His body trembles feeling like he was being filled with cement starting from his toes. He tries to call for help but his voice could only make strained gasps before his pupils completely glaze over white....Caleb's mind...His eyes open before around finding only darkness around him. He didn't know where he was but it felt like the dreamscape yet there was something.. sinister about it"W-Where am I?", Caleb spoke."Huhuhu, oh who really knows? Subconscious? Psyche?...dreamscape? Call it whatever, it's all the same."Caleb eyes widen, "That voice. I've been hearing it all day. Show yourself!"No soon as he says this a green rippling glowing gas appears before him. A pair of slender arms, long silver hair, and feminine form but no legs only large wispy tail. She stared at him with haunting glowing green eye and a wicked grin with a long serpent-like tongue. Caleb instantly regrets his request."Hey there, sexy.", She spoke rocking her neck and bumping her 'hips'."W-Who and WHAT are you?!", Caleb inquired."Name's Heather. Heather the very friendly ghost.", She spoke lewdly doing the finger in the hole gesture, "At last, I get to formally meet the great Caleb Bizzell.""Formally?", he questions."Well, yeah we met once already when I was inside Burns today. Hell of a first date, huh?", Heather spoke crooning whimsically.Caleb jaw drops in sheer surprise, "Y-YOU were the one making her act that way?!"Bingo! Now, I guess your next question is why I'm here? Well, long story short, I'm commandeering this vessel of yours. I'm a woman on a mission.", Heather playfully spoke smiling wickedly at Caleb."W-What?!""Gotta say though you are a crazy tough human to be able to resist my presence this long. I've been clawing and clawing at your psyche ever since I first jumped into you. You lasted so much longer than a normal guy and you didn't even need the magic blue pill ehehehe", the ghost girl praises with a taunting chuckle.Caleb gives her a look of confusion."But now, crack are propogating in your mental barriers. I guess hitting your little wifey hurt yo feewings huh horse fucker?", Heather mocks vanishing and appearing around him. She then grabs him by the neck from behind. Her slender but strong fingers making him gasp for air. She straightens her other fingers like a dagger, "Now, I can finally see inside this head of yours."She grins before digging her nails in his temple as he screams out in pain. Her eye emit streams of green light as images and memories come flooding into the ghosts vision. She throws head back moaning as Caleb screams grow louder. When she was done, she pushes him off having her fill as he falls on his hands and knees trembling and holding his head while groaning."Haaa haaaa...Hahahaha...AHAHAHAHAHA OH GOD! THAT WAS SO GOOD. YOUR LIFE UP UNTIL NOW HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING ONE. OH MAN, AND IT'S NO WONDER THOSE GIRLS ADORE YOU. THEY CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THAT DICK! I POSSESSED ME A REAL PLAYER! A SUPERPOWERED PLAYER AT THAT HAHAHAAAA!", She spoke maniacally as a thick green miasma enshrouded her body before covering the entire area.It spreads onto Caleb's body and he immediately feels nauseous and an aching pain through every nerve. He struggles to stand only for his knees to give out and he falls backwards. His widen in horror seeing the malevolent sport hover over him with a faces contorted into a horrific wide smile showing pointed teeth and a slender black tongue. He manic, eerie green eyes fixated on him and she floats down placing he her hands to his shoulder."I knew the moment you walk in the door I would enjoy this.", She spoke in a voice the shook Caleb's core."W-What the hell do you want from me?", Caleb choked out his voice shaky."Isn't it obvious?", Heather spoke hungrily moving her right hand down his chest before grabbing him down below making him flinch shutting his eyes as she strokes him. She grabs his cheeks forcing him to look at her, "I wanna take you for a riiiide!", She growled in a distorted voice with physics defying grin'AHHHHHHH!', Caleb screams echo in the void of his mind....meanwhile...Back to the girls, Drei had just finished explaining to other girls the true nature of Burns and Shine's death much to their shock."My god...so you believe it's some kind of parasite?", Ein inquires"Yes. That's my theory at least.""Seriously, becoming a corpse before they actually die? It kinda sounds more like the Zombie virus. Right?", Zwei points out as Mirabelle and Camilla look to her incredulously."Not likely. The Z-13 virus that creates the living dead has two known variants: Lazarus, the most common and creates your standard undead and usually only infects humans, and RVW (Rip Van Winkle), an evolved version that creates undead with more supernatural abilities like Banshee or Lich. However, given the nature of the wounds on Burns and Shine, it's more close to a parasitic infection and a rather aggressive one.", Drei explains."That sounds awful. I can't imagine those two women went through.", Lyca spoke in a remorseful tone."Yes, and that brings me to my next concern.", Drei says in morose tone, "It's possible Mr. Bizzell is infected with this parasite.""WHAT?!", "QUE?!", all of the girls stated simultaneously jumping to their feet."W-What do you mean?! Are saying Dear in infected with whatever...killed those two women?!", Mirabelle stated beginning to panic."MAY be infected? Only maybe.", Drei clarified."In other words, ju do not know! For all we know, Señor is probably just very upset about what happened to him today! Ju were not with him so DO NOT just go making assumptions!", Camilla stated defensively."It's not an assumption, it's HYPOTHESIS. One is based on research and reason the other is Yahoo Answers.", Drei answered locking eyes with Camilla, "Also, I will not apologize for my actions since I believe I acted in accordance with my duties as a MON agent."Camilla gives her an annoyed look about to retort her be Lyca jumps in."S-So...what are we going to do? How can we help Chief?!", Lyca spoke not wanting to finish the sentence."...I don't know.", Drei regettably answers much to their horror, "We'll first have to see about Caleb, whether if he's truly infected. And given what we know from Burns, the parasite causes a sharp change in personality...that makes the exchange with Ms. Marequine that more concerning."Mirabelle and the others look to her in shock."No! That's...h-he was just under a lot of stress and...", Mirabelle defends before realizing she was saying exactly what she'd think when she was with...Jason."Does that make it ok? Don't you dare think you deserved it.", Drei spoke seriously.Mirabelle went quiet casting her gaze to the floor not sure what to think.Camilla and Lyca also wanted to deny it but couldn't muster the words to say that could excuse him.Drei sighs lowly, "Listen, we are ALL worried about him but we have to understand what we're dealing with before we can help him.""What do you suppose we do?", Mirabelle asks weakly."I gave my contact information to the paramedics that retrieve Burns and Shine's bodies with instructions to contact me after the preliminary results of the autopsy which, in this state, usually takes up to 15 hours.", Drei informs."Wait, you can do that?! Don't you need special authorization?", Ein questioned."Only in this very specific, pragmatic, proposterously irregular circumstance. Also, it helps they assumed I was the agent in charge.""A quién le importa(Who fucking cares)?! What are we to do about Señor?!", Camilla demanded as Drei and her sisters give her serious looks."If Mr. Bizzell doesn't show further symptoms in that time, we can takes it as a good sign then work on removing the parasite from his body.", Drei informs before switching gears, "If he does...we'd have to take measures."Mirabelle and the others look to her with shock."W-What kind of measures?", Lyca stated in distress."Ones were if he turns violent we'd to subdue to keep him from harming us...or himself.", Drei says as her sisters wore sullen expressions."Ju cannot be serious!", Camilla protested."I'm as serious as a lit cigar next to an oxygen tank. Don't test my seriousness."Camilla clenches her fist in frustration relenting to the situation."We'll carry on like normal but we'll keep a close eye on him for anything strange, behavior or otherwise.", Drei advises the girls who each listened with begrudging or disheartened expressions, "We won't tell him about the parasite. Not yet. Last thing he needs is to freak out."Drei looks to Mirabelle, Lyca, and Camilla all with deeply worried expressions. She then looks to her sisters both aware of what needed to be done."Listen, I know you're all worried but this is all we can do for now.", Drei spoke."Y-Yeah but...", Mirabelle utters softly ."Hey girls!", called the voice of Caleb getting all their attention. The look to him seeing him dressed in his t-shirt and jogging pants, "Sorry about that I just needed to clear my mind a bit and get out of those clothes."The others don't respond only look at him curiously like small animals determining whether or not he's a threat. Caleb then notices they were all huddled together."What's goin' on in here? You guys forming some kind of cult or somethin?", Caleb chuckled."Uhh, no sir? We were...just about to talking. Is everything ok?", Ein tenatively asks."Yeah, I'm ok.", Caleb assures looking to Mirabelle, "Hey Moon pie...listen sorry what happened that was...I-I don't what that was. This day has just been...ALL KINDS of shit. I'm so sorry if I hurt you. You forgive me, right?", Caleb apologizes sincerely as Mirabelle looks to him curiously before calmly speaking."Yes. I forgive you Dear.", Mirabelle says putting on a smile for him."Thank you. Now come on guys, I'm perfectly fine. I mean aside from being crazy hungry. Anyone else hungry? It's like past 6, about time for dinner don't you think? Hey "Camilla", do you feel like making that chicken fajita we had last week. I loved that so much.", Caleb asks in a nonchalant tone.They girls look to each other unsure of what to do. Camilla perplexed but by the sudden and specific request and the way he said her name."I...of course, Senor.", the She Devil says with small grin before going into the kitchen as Caleb watched her. He's then approached by Mirabelle."D-Dear?", Mirabelle spoke up, "Are you sure you feel...ok?"Caleb gently cups the side of her face which she sweetly leans into enjoying his big, kind hands, "Yeah baby, I'm fine. Let's just relax now.""R-Right.", Mirabelle spoke staring into his brown eyes feeling something off about them."Hey Lyca, wanna play some games?", Caleb offers."S-Sure chief! Sounds like fun!", Lyca spoke with a smile while her tail didn't move an inch. Ein went to help Camilla while Drei and Zwei observe Caleb closely.He boots up the PS4 proceeding to scroll through the gaming library....inside Caleb's mind...The true Caleb was bound by green chains directly in front of two very large circular window observing everything on the outside."NOOOO! MOON PIE! LYCA! CAMILLA! ANYONE! HEELLLLP! THAT'S NOT ME! I'M RIGHT HERE! THAT'S NOT ME!", Caleb's soul cried out in vain before a cloud of miasma appears forming into Heather."Shhhhh quiet now my little chocolate cupcake", she spoke seductively caressing his face with her finger as he pulls away glaring at her, "The game is just getting started.""NOOOOAAHHH!", he screams as she seers his neck with green energy....Outside, Caleb could be seen grinning in satisfaction as her selects Tekken 7. His pupils glow with white light for a second as he starts the game.
  
    Chapter Text
    Chapter 43: Soul vs Soul...20 minutes earlier...'Caleb' had just finished cleaning the last of the pills on the floor in the bathroom. He hold the bottles up reading it."Pfft ha! 7.5 milligrams? The hell is your damage?", 'Caleb' scoffs with a laugh before going to the mirror looking at himself, "Hehe I kindin'. I already know...among other things about you now.", He smiles wickedly his eyes taking a green glow.'Nnnhg let me go you fucking crazy ass-AHH!', the real Caleb screamed internally before being silenced."Now that's no way to talk to a lady or should I say man? Haha! Wow it has been awhile since I possessed a guy. Welp, first order of business let's check under the hood.", 'Caleb' says pulling his jogging pants down to his knees. He looks down at his equipment giving an impressed, "Hooweewee, good for you! Look at this tasty little hunk meat and nice big mmmanly balls! "He emphasizes playing with his testicles and stroking his shaft much to the real Caleb's disgust'Stop! Stop touching me! I mean STOP making me touch me! I mean J-JUST STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING!', real Caleb reprimanded"Aww, but I was gonna try and make you shoot your hot load all over your clean bathroom floor.", 'Caleb' spoke deviously smiling.'NO! JUST NO!'"Eh, you're right. There'll be plenty of time for that later.", 'Caleb' pulls up his pants, "Right now, I still have a job to do. So, I think I'm gonna try out that teleporting thing of yours."'Wait, wha-'*zoom*' Caleb' teleported out of the bathroom back into his bedroom looking around astonished."Ho-o-ollllly shit! That's cool! So it seems that horse wifey of your gave you some cool powers. Satella definitely know about THIS."'Wha? Who the hell is Satella?!', real Caleb spoke as his outer self pick up his cell phone."Thaaaat's not something your pretty little dick over. I'm just getting in touch with my gals.", 'Caleb' spoke quickly texting a bunch of stuff to a number real Caleb didn't recognize then hitting send. A couple minutes there was a response, "Alrighty, that's done!""Who was that?! What did you just do?!", real Caleb screamed."Jeez, you sure are nosy. You know, women don't like that in a man. I mean you're sticking to those whores every night do you should.", 'Caleb' spoke in a jeering tone.'You shut your DAMN mouth about the-ARRHH!', real Caleb screamed out feeling a jolt of pain through his astral form."You've got quite the mouth. In more ways than one, ha.", 'Caleb' chortled before raising his hand creating small purple spherical energy barrier before condensing it further into a purple fire-like aura and smiling wickedly, "Oh yeah, these might come in handy, such a strong vessel I got me. Ah! Almost forgot the most important thing!"'Caleb' proceed pull down his pants, take his phone, and snap a picture of his flacid penis much to inner Caleb shock and confusion."The FUCK was that for?!""A momento. Don't worry about it.", 'Caleb' replied send the picture in a text message before turning to the door, "Alrighty tighty, let's get this show on the road."'Caleb' exits the bedroom going into the living room where he could hear the girls talking about something....Present..."Woo! Come on! That the best you got?!", 'Caleb' chortle furiously mashing the controller buttons playing a fighting game, Blazblue: Central Fiction, with Lyca. The She-wolf focused intently on the screen mashing her controller as well.The whole time Mirabelle along with Zwei and Drei discreetly kept an eye on Caleb. His behavior was a bit different compared to when her first arrived but so far things seem fine.'ASTRAL FINISH! Yuuki Terumi wins!', Came the sound of the game as the green haired game character on screen erupts in manic laughter entire body glowing with malicious green aura."Woooo! Three for three baby!", 'Caleb' hoots ecstatically celebrating another victory as Lyca sighs in defeat, "Lyca, baby, I love ya but ya fuckin SUCK at this game!""Hehe, yeah. I-I guess I still need to get used to it.", Lyca replied rubbing her head sheepishly while Mirabelle and two of the Zyklons, Zwei and Drei, casually observed."You seem to be feeling a bit chipper Dear.", Mirabelle says in calm tone."Yeah, well, what good will it do to keep worrying about what happened today. What's done is done. Am I right?", 'Caleb' replies nonchalantly.Drei and Zwei look to each other."Yeah. It just seem like you got over it...REALLY fast.", Zwei replies in a scrutinous tone which 'Caleb' picked up on."Well, ever consider this is a new coping method I'm trying. Talk about insensitive!", 'he' replies as they each appear unsure how to respond before he continues, "Alright, you lose, Zwei, get little weasel ass over here and show me watcha got."Zwei and the others look to each other before said wind weasel goes down as Lyca moves from her original spot hand the controller to her."Kay, but don't get cocky. Unlike Lycs, I'm a pro at games like these. Don't start whining when I beat you.", Zwei spoke challengingly looking at him.'Caleb' smirks, "We'll see about that."The two begin selecting their characters with 'Caleb' choosing Yuuki Terumi again and Zwei picking Bang Shishigami. Lyca observes the screen as Drei then leans close nudging Mirabelle to get her attention."So, you notice it too, right?", Drei whispered."...Yes.", Mirabelle whispered back reluctantly, "It's still Dear but...""Do you feel we should sedate him now before it gets worse?", Drei suggests taking out a few small darts coated in green oil."N-No. Please, p-perhaps it's just his way of coping like he said. Yes.", Mirabelle says keeping her voice down trying to sound assured which Drei didn't buy."Ms. Marequine...", Drei spoke noticing the fear in her voice.'Caleb' looks at them suspiciously while the match started on screen. He then turns away when Drei noticing him staring....Internally, Heather observes with annoyed look."Hmm, those two could be trouble. Especially that little slant eyed furry midget. She was with you today, wasn't she? Nnngh can't touch the Nightmare but that midgets has to go.", The ghost girl spoke glaring maliciously at the weasel girl."W-what do you mean? What are you planning to do?!", real Caleb stated in deep concern."Haven't decided yet. Unless youuu got some ideas nyahahaha.", Heather chuckled tracing her finger at his neck making him recoil away fearfully. She then notices his wrists, "Ooh, looks like I'm gonna have to hurry too. I'm already starting to suck you dry."She pulls down his sleeves showing hideous yellowish-green glowing veins on his wrists which he looks at with horror."What...What is this?", real Caleb uttered."Ohhh shit! I better focus, this girl is pretty good", Heather stated ignoring him as she focuses on the game , "I'm gonna shut you up for awhile so I can concentrate, kay?""What the hell that-mmph! MMMMMMMPHH!", real Caleb uttered his mouth forcefully closed shut as if sealed together with industrial strength adhesive...."Señor, Fajitas are ready!", Camilla says as a plate of 6 chicken fajita wraps goes floating over to him."Ah thanks babe.", 'Caleb' spoke taking the plate sitting in his lap then proceeds back to the game. A couple more bowls come levitating from the kitchen for Lyca and Mirabelle; a beef and seasoned rice meal and veggie burrito bowl with plenty of avocado respectively."I made you guys something too!", Ein called from the kitchen to her sisters."Something good I hope!", Zwei called back focused on her game as her character was getting pulverized in the corner. Lyca could be seen happily scarfing down her food along with Mirabelle casually eating and glancing at Caleb ever so often."How about you hope I don't leave in the chicken liver this time.", Ein replied."Ugh, I hate liver.", Zwei recoiled in disgust."I know!", Ein stated.'ASTRAL FINISH!', the tv blares as Zwei jaw drops at losing 3 rounds in a row with one of her best characters."Ooooh SO close! Should've been paying attention instead of engaging in banter. Maybe you're not much of a pro after all.", 'Caleb' taunted the weasel before taking a bite of one of the frajitas instantly taken aback by how delicious it was."I-I was just warming up! Bang isn't even my best character. THAT title goes to my girl Makoto!", Zwei attested."Oh really? Think you can win next game against me at your best?", Caleb says raising an intrigued eyebrow, "How about we make it more...interesting?"Zwei looks to him curiously as does Drei and Mirabelle, "How so?""Let's make a bet. Since it's you and Lyca against me, all three of us share in the punishment. Sound good?", 'Caleb' says as Lyca looks up with her mouth stuff upon hearing her name."Hmm...alright. Fine with you Lycs?", Zwei asks he She-wolf.Lyca chews a bit more before gulping down, "Hahh, sure! I love a challenge when there are steaks! BOTH kinds!"'Caleb' smirks wickedly, "Great. Basically, if I lose, I will become your and Lyca personal servants for 24 hours starting as soon as the game ends. Anything you guys want me to do. Anything."Zwei pauses at thought, "A-Anything?""Yep. Of course if I win, then it's the other way around.", Caleb assures while Drei gives him a skeptical look.Zwei minds drifts starting to imagine the various activities she could with that kind of power. A small lewd smile and blush cross her cheeks. She then looks to Lyca who nods emphatically."Alright, deal!"The two begin the match with them picking their respective character. 'Caleb' takes the initiative but Zwei does let him keep it already proving her skills much to his intrigue. Mirabelle and Drei could still be seen observing him while Ein and Camilla could be heard having a small conversation in the kitchen. As the match continues, both of them wins a couple rounds and now on the last round. It was winner take all and Zwei could taste victory until 'Caleb' turns the tide resulting in another...'ASTRAL FINISH!'Zwei's jaw drops in disbelief with the controller limply dangling in her hand. Drei lightly shakes her head in disappointment."Ahaa! I win! GG! Get wrecked girl!", Caleb taunted doing the cabbage patch holding the fajita and controller."Aww we lost?", Lyca says in disappointment."Afraid so sweetheart.", Caleb in a patronizing tone, "And know what that means, don't you?"Zwei sighs flopping her back to the couch arms folded, "Fine, what do you want?"Caleb touches his chin in thought while looking at them with a sketchy gaze, "Let's see...hmmm Lyca?""Yes Chief?""Get down on all fours."The request caught Lyca and the others off guard."H-Huh?""I. Want you. To get on all fours.", Caleb repeated with emphasis."D-Dear, why do you-""Uhbabab! Not talking to you, I'm talking you Moon pie. She agreed to do anything if I won. Now, hands and knees.", Caleb says in cold tone that unnerved the Nightmare a bit. Zwei looked more uneasy about the situation."I-It's fine. We did lose fair and square.", Lyca assured looking to her before moving from her seat on her hands and knees. Caleb smiles in satisfaction.He then places the plate with two half-eaten fajita on the floor next to him."Come here doggy, got some scraps for ya.", Caleb spoke alarming them even more."Ok! That's just going too far!", Zwei stated getting to her feet."And how FAR would you have gone if it was reversed?", Caleb shot back.Zwei was taken aback for a second with an embarassed blush, "N-Nothing like-""Zwei, it's alright.", Lyca assured crawling on all fours over to the plate."Lyca, you don't have to do it.", Mirabelle says in concern."She's right, it's just some stupid bet!", Zwei says glaring at Caleb who just give an indifferent look."No! He issued a challenge, we accepted, we lost, now we take our punishment.", Lyca affirms looking sadly over the scraps on the floor and proceeding to eat them to Mirabelle and Zwei's disbelief. Drei looks at the scene before noticing his right arms trembling."Yeah! Eat it up! You like that doggy? Go ahead, bark for master. Bark.", Caleb demanded as he suddenly grabs her hair forcing her face into the plate."W-Woof! Woof!", Lyca reluctantly uttered."Ok that's e-""Oh! Don't worry, didn't forget about you weasel girl. Come here.", Caleb says gesturing with her finger.Zwei pauses reluctantly stepping toward him. He gestures to whisper in her ears."Ok, so I want you to...", he whispers something in her ear before she recoils back looking appalled, "Of course, if your too much of a coward while Lyca here is committed to seeing her punishment through."Zwei notices Lyca looking up with food smeared on her cheeks with the pleading eyes of a puppy. She reluctantly steps back beginning to undo her sash on her waist and then starting to remove her clan's dressings to Mirabelle and Drei's shock. Camilla and Ein appear from the kitchen with the rest of the food curious of the noise in the living room. Their attention was immediately focused on Lyca on all fours and Zwei beginning to strip down to her underwear."Z-Zwei?! Ms. Kessler?! What are you doing?!", Ein stated"Well we had ourselves a little bet and unfortunately they lost.", 'Caleb' explains as Zwei reluctantly removes her spandex."What KIND of a bet?", Camilla jumps displeased seeing Lyca eating off the floor like an animal."One where whoever lost would become the winners servants for a day. Which includes doing whatever they say.", 'Caleb' unflinchingly explains before turning to a now stripped down Zwei clad in green underwear and bra showing her petite yet curvaceous figure and perky C-cups which he appreciated, "Now, carry on Ms. Zwei.""Fine, Mr. Bizzell.", Zwei spoke through clenched teeth in annoyance before getting on her knees, squishing he boobs together, and stating, "I'm a dirty pervert! I'm a DIRTY pervert!"Caleb laughs, "HAHAHA come on, you can do better than that! Louder!"Lyca looks up at Zwei having finished the food on the plate."I'M A HUGE PERVERT!", Zwei exclaims loudly much to shock of Mirabelle and the others and her embarassment."That's better!", Caleb spoke in a pleased tone before looking to Lyca, "Alright, Lyca, why don't you give the huge pervert a kiss on the lips?"The other, especially Lyca and Zwei, we're very surprised by the request."OK, that's enough, sir!", Ein stated firmly."Don't you think you're taking this a bit too far Dear?!", Mirabelle stated in a worried tone."Am I? We're just having fun.", 'Caleb' replies looking to Zwei with a lecherous gaze."Do they LOOK like THEY'RE having fun?", Drei spoke in tone that caught his attention, "This wasn't your idea of fun before?""This isn't like you at all, Dear.", Mirabelle says with a deeply concerned look.'Caleb' pauses unsure just how to answer before noticing the concerned and suspicious stares of the girls. He sighs to himself."Haaa, yeah, yeah you're right. That was over the line.", he relents, "Ok you two, bets off. You're released. Zwei get those clothes before ya catch cold now."Zwei picks up her clothes looking a bit irritated as Lyca gets up from the floor."Sorry guys, guess I went a little overboard.""Very much so, Señor.", Camilla spoke arms folded disapprovingly."Sorry Lyca, sorry Zwei.", he apologizes"I-It's ok...Chief.", Lyca uttered not wanting to make eye contact."Yeah...", Zwei spoke a bit coldly patting Lyca's shoulder to comfort her. Ein puts the food down and asks about her sister who brushes her off not in the mood to talk. 'Caleb' senses the growing tension in the air deciding to diffuse it."Ok...I think that's enough games for one night. How about a movie while we you guys eat?" I'm already full. Fajitas we DElicious Camilla. 10 outta 10."The others give him inquisitive looks uneasy at how quickly he moved past that."A-Alright, Dear. Let's watch a movie.", Mirabelle says much to the surprise of the others."Awesome! I know one you guys will like.", 'Caleb' says turning off the PlayStation then grabbing the remote turning on Hulu. He the notices to plate and food scraps on the floor, "Oop, forgot about that plate. Lyca you're a messy little eater. Don't worry I'll clean it up.""Ok, Dear.", Mirabelle spoke with a smile while he goes to the kitchen for papertowels."Senora, what are ju-?", Camilla whispers to her as Drei and the others look to her."Shhh, it's fine.", Mirabelle cut her off."No it's not! You seen that shit right? He made Lycs eat off the floor like a PET!", Zwei retorted slipping her spandex back on while Lyca looks off shamefully."He's already demonstrating abnormal behavior. It's only a matter of time before-", Drei informs before Mirabelle cuts her off."No!", she stated just loud enough for her to hear, "We still don't know that. Please, just endure it. I'm sure he'll be ok.", she pleaded.Drei and the others look to her unsure how to respond before Camilla jumps in."I agree with Señora. We cannot jump to conclusions too quickly.", she spoke before levitating a second bowl of fresh salad into the Nightmare lap. Mirabelle smiles appreciatively as Drei looks to her sisters."Are you alright, Lyca?", Mirabelle inquires."Yeah...just...had some bad memories is all. I'm with you too about Chief.", Lyca confirms putting on a brave face.Suddenly, Caleb' appears humming a tune before starting to clean up the mess from the floor."Haaa, alright. We'll observe him a little longer but the second he starts something like that again, I'm sedating him.", Drei informs showing a dart in her sleeve."It's a deal.", Mirabelle complies."Whatcha guys talkin about?", Caleb spoke cheekily."N-Nothing in particular! *Munch* Mmm, splendid salad Camilla! Do I detect macadamia is this one?", Mirabelle spoke eating her food. Drei was still not convinced about their choice."Oh, the fried chicken is done you guys.", Ein says before presenting a plate of fried chicken and steamed rice to Drei who's nose immediately twitches befor accepting the plate, "It's fine. We'll act the moment we sense danger."Drei reluctantly nods before Ein gives Zwei her plate."Oooh, that smells tasty!", Lyca say mouth beginning to water."Hehe, you can have some too Ms. Kessler.", Ein says before presenting a plate to her which the She-wolf happily accepts thanking her."Actually, that does smell good. Mind giving me some? I'm still a little hungry.", 'Caleb' spoke before pressing play starting the movie and taking a seat."Oh...not a problem sir"', Ein says before taking some chicken to 'Caleb'."Two juicy breasts and two juicy thighs thank you.", 'Caleb' says with toothy grin doing a double Peace sign."Umm...they're not really WHOLE pieces.", Ein clarifies lowering herself a bit give him the plate.He smirks raising an eyebrow noticing the curvaceous outline of her large breasts in her green kunoichi robes and accepts the food saying "Well they look like perfectly fine pieces of meat to me. And you know black folks when it comes to they meat. Thanks hun."Ein notices the hunger in his gaze seeing he looking at her chest. She quickly raises back up with an embarassed and uncomfortable blush, "Y-You're welcome."She quickly turns away quickly going to the other side of the room as 'Caleb' sank his teeth in the tender, crispy meat staring at the Karmaitaichi plump rear. Ein sits down instinctively hugging her sides wanting to cover herself feeling dirty. Mirabelle and Camilla were of her behavior but didn't press her. Meanwhile, Drei noticed the entire thing, and was glaring at 'Caleb'. He noticed and shot a glare back aggressively biting into the meat.The next hour was spent watching the movie, a horror movie called 'Doctor Sleep' as they finished eating. The girls, especially Mirabelle, found the story rather interesting with ideas of addiction/dependence, facing inner demons, and embracing one's true strength. Although, much of the time, they distracted by 'Caleb' blurting out certain details ruining any sense of immersion. Then there was the scene in the movie where the cultists, 'True Knot', torture a little boy to death while consuming his life force. Throughout, 'Caleb' was heartily laughing at the scene which greatly disturbed Mirabelle and the others.Now it was they at the climax of the film. Camilla and Ein had taken up the dishes and utensils and were now washing dishes. Camilla offered to use her magic to clean them but Ein simply wanted an excuse to not be in the living room for a few minutes. The others continue watching the scene of the movie were the main characters arrive a the Overlook hotel for the final showdown.Caleb slaps his palms making Mirabelle and Lyca flinch, "Oho here we go! I love this part right here.", he stated seeing the 'True Knot' leader enter the mind of the female lead.Mirabelle and the other's anxiety had been steadily growin. It was becoming difficult for Mirabelle to stay calm. She knew he was slowly getting worse and didn't know what to do."Hm, I'm thirsty. Brb.", Caleb says before raising up going to the kitchen. Drei's eyes follow him getting an uneasy feeling in her gut and not just from all the fried chicken.Caleb enters the kitchen seeing Ein and Camilla at the sink. One washing the other drying and levitating them into cabinets and speaking softly about something."Sup, girls?", he spoke with a wide smile getting their attention."Ah, sir, s-something wrong?", Ein inquires as Camilla gives her an look."I should be asking you guys.", Caleb says strutting over to them getting in between, "Been having quite a few little powwows tonight. I'm starting to suspect there's something going on behind my back."Camilla and Ein discretely exchange looks both not wanting to alarm him and exacerbate his condition."Not at all, Señor.", Camilla assures he inches closer, "Ju had a terrible day and do not want to trouble ju with unnecessary stress.""Yeahhh, but I'm managing. Besides...", Caleb spoke resting a hand to each of their backs, making Ein flinch, beginning to caresses their upper backs, "I can't be stressed with pretty young things like you guys around."Camilla and Ein shudder feeling his hands working their way down lower backs. He then slaps Ein on the butt making her gasp loudly and surprising Camilla."S-Stop!", Ein stated quickly pulling away, "T-This is not appropriate! I'm your bodyguard! Nothing more!"Mirabelle and the other girls turn to kitchen curious of what was happening."I know you are. But you know my body includes all the equipment that come with it.", 'Caleb' emphasizes grabbing his crotch at her making her eyes widen in shock, "Now come guard my body with that body."Ein deeply blushes in embarassment quickly backing out of the kitchen actually bumping into Drei almost knocking her down."Ein?", "Sis?", Drei and Zwei spoke simultaneously."Sorry! I need to step for some air!", Ein stated hiding her flustered, shameful face while hurrying out the front door slamming."What did you do to her?", Zwei demanded."Hm, that's a shame.", Caleb shrugged ignoring her before turning to Camilla, "So whaddaya helping me relieve some stress my muy caliente queen?", he spoke closing in on her grabbing a handful of her latina booty."Get off me!", Camilla instinctively stated shoving him away to his surprise. She didn't want to do it but the way he was talking and how he touched her was not like him. It more like her ex-husband."Wha? You're giving me blue balls too?!", 'Caleb' stated incredulously."Don't ignore me! What did you do to our sister?!", Zwei stated more firmly. Mirabelle and Lyca for up joining them as the movie continued to play in the background."Apparently, he WAS thirsty just not for diet Dr. Pepper."Gross. Why the hell would I want DIET Dr. Pepper?", 'Caleb' recoiled in disgust.Huge red flag; the girls eyes widen and jaw drop in profound shock. The man who would LITERALLY replace his blood with the drink if he could just rejected said drink. Mirabelle looks to Drei and nods."Dear...", Mirabelle spoke approaching him carefully, "Listen to me...you are not well...you are not acting like yourself at all.""Oh? And how exactly AM I acting?", 'Caleb' asks resting his elbows to the counter, chin to his palms, as Drei stealthily maneuvers around him."You're...you're not you, Chief.", Lyca says."Oh please...", Caleb utters rolling as Drei taking out the small vial and dart coating the tip."It is true.", Camilla says glaring intently at him, "Ju are never like this. Never."Caleb grins in disbelief scoffing at her beginning to pace as Drei makes a crossbow with her fingers aiming the dart for his lower neck."We want to help you. Please, let us help you.", Mirabelle appeals as Drei readies the injection." 'Help' huh? Does that help include Drei trying to stick me with whatever is in that dart.", 'Caleb' says looking over his shoulder at the little weasel who fires the dart with pressurized air only for it to get repelled by a small barrier to her and Mirabelle surprise. He then turns to Drei to with a malicious gleam in his eye, "Wanna explain there, huh Legal Loli?"Drei gives a slightly annoyed look before saying, "We believe it's possible you were infected with a parasite. The same one Burns was afflicted with."His smile vanishes replaced with a malign frown, "Parasite?", he breaths through clenched teeth."Yes and for yours safety, and our own, we have to sedate you for the time being. You're already showing behavior similar to Burns.", Drei advises taking out another dart primed and ready.'Parasite huh?', Heather spoke from with his head her anger building."I'LL TELL YA WHO'S A PARASITE! YOU FUCKING WHORES IN MY LIFE!", 'Caleb' blurted out.Mirabelle and the others were taken aback as the front opens shuts with Ein stepping inside having got some fresh air...and underwear."I-I'm back. What did-", Ein says with a lingering feeling of shame before he interupts."OH GOOD! The extra THICC weasel's back! Surprised you got out the door with that fat ass!", Caleb stated making Ein gives a horrified look at being called fat.Hey! YOU don't get talk about my sister like that! Only I can do that!", Zwei jumps in mostly defending her, "You've been acting like a total asshole since settled in!""I don't need to take any lip from fucking PERVERT like you. Trust me, I KNOW one when I see one! You seemed reeeaaal interested in our bet earlier. I can only imagine what you had planned for me and the dog over if I lost!"Zwei was shocked speechless at being outed."Chief, stop! Don't be mean to Zwei!", Lyca stated"SHUT THAT BARKING YOU RETARDED MUTT!", Caleb shouted at her making her jump back in fear, "This is why nobody in your old pack loved you because you're a stupid, WEAK, WORTHLESS, BITCH and you always will be!"Mirabelle and the others were shocked. Lyca body trembles as tears starts pouring from her eyes and unintelligible whimpers escape her lips before she falls to her knees as if looking the strength to stand."Lyca!", Mirabelle and Zwei exclaim going to her side. 'Caleb' smirks in satisfaction. With his subconscious, the real Caleb anguished at the scene tears welling calling out to Lyca but no sound could escape his sealed lips. Not anyone would hear him anyway.Camilla grabs him by the shirt collar forcefully slamming him against the wall holding him up him with one arm. Her ruby red demonic eyes filled with rage."Camilla wait-!", Mirabelle stated in panic."No Señora! Regardless of the circumstance, will NEVER allow this behavior in my life again!", Camilla stated furiously."Hahaha, you serious? You really gonna kill your 'Destined One'?", Caleb spoke sardonically.Camilla eyes widen for moment clenching her harder around his collar."Haha, go ahead! Add to the body count. Your mother sure thought so when she abandoned you. She had sense to see what a monster she made", Caleb uttered the last part lowly for her to hear before grabbing her wrist.Camilla eyes widen as memories of her mother flashed before her stopping the image of her horrified face when she brutally killed those men. Her grip loosens and 'Caleb' pushes her off making her stumble back before catching herself at the counter. A mix of anger and anguish on her face."I think it was a good you DID lose those babies. Someone like you isn't FIT to raise a child!", Caleb to berate her as Mirabelle and the others listen horrified by his words."Stop it...", Camilla utter softly."Only thing you're fit to be is a sex toy. I bet you got lots of recommendations from those dudes in the cartel.", 'Caleb' taunted strutting closer swaying his arms as if without a care."I SAID STOP!", Camilla screams out threateningly in her demonic voice her voice cracking near the end as she fights back her tears. A red magic seal repeatedly forms and unforms in her palm conflicted about using the spell."Tch, typical of the Devil. Can't get your way so you resort to intimidation and violence.", he spoke noticing her struggling and leans closer, "There's no way in hell I'd EVER want a child by a murderous demon slut like you."Camilla feels a sharp pain in her chest as if a knife had just pierced her chest and then twisted. She covers her mouth trying to muffle her sobs as tears flow down her cheeks.Within his mind, real Caleb watches in shear horror and sorrow as Camilla struggles to contain her sob. He then feels his anger building as his eyes begin to glow purple and stream of purple electricity shoots up his right arm through his restraints."Please...stop...", Mirabelle shakily utters looking to him with tear-filled eyes, "This...ISN'T you, Dear. It's whatever is inside you. You would never say these awful things. Please...stop all this and let us help you. We love you and we want to help you."Camilla and the others look to her as Caleb turn with an indifferent expression."Love? That's what you call it?", Caleb spoke much to her surprise as he continues, "I just call it 'fun'. You are all funny to me. Acting like I give a shit about your problem, when all I want are those benefits for taking you animals in. Monthly payments from the government, time off work, hell even get to fuck you whenever I want. You think I ever loved any of you?"Mirabelle and the others hearts sank with ever word her spoke trying to fully grasp the reality of the situation."Especially you, my literal horse 'wife'.", Caleb emphasized, "You thought I really loved you huh? No. Why would I love a sheltered, immature, worthless coward that almost left me to die?!"Mirabelle shakes her head refusing to believing what she was hearing, "No. You...you don't mean that.", she spoke choking back her sobs."Get this through you THICK purple head for dumb fucking horse. I. Don't. Love. You!", 'Caleb' emphasizes as, within, real Caleb struggles to break loose of his restraints desperate to get to Mirabelle.Mirabelle eyes widen feeling her heart on the verge of shattering, "No...""Yes! Jesus, now I see what Jason through.", Caleb says incredulously.Mirabelle eyes widen feeling am indescribable despair that began to envelop her heart to where she was struck silent unable to conjure a single word anymore....Inside his head, real Caleb could Mirabelle heartbroken expression and the person causing her and others pain standing next to him laughing...."Hahahaha! Oh this is just too good! Hahahahaha!", Heather laughs hysterically holding her sides as Caleb glares at her with pure hate clenching her teeth growling and pulling at the chains. Heather takes notice of him, "Ohh, what's wrong? Did I hurt your girlfriends feelings? Well, technically, YOU did. Guess she's learning the hard way never to give your heart to anyone.""You BITCH!", Caleb stated feeling pure rage building as purple lightning ripples around him and through his restraint."Give up! You'll never break free of my grasp. Now, if you'll excuse me I have a show to finish.", Heather stated vanishing in a green of green smoke. Caleb struggles with the restraints even more as mores purple spark pulsars from his body. A crack in one of the chains starts forming....outside..."Are you done?", Drei inquires.Caleb notices her gives a slightly irritated look not answering."I asked you a question.", Drei says in tone laced with venom, "Are you fine torturing the women in your life who love you? If so, I advise you to take the sedative...now.""And if I refuse?", 'Caleb' says challengingly."Maybe I wasn't being specific. You are GOING to take this sedative even if it's by force. You may be our client but you are also currently a biohazard that must be dealt with.", Drei spoke readying the dart as Ein took a position block his path and Camilla does the same have regained a little of her composer. Mirabelle and Lyca look to him sadly as Zwei helps completely box him in. Caleb looks between them seeing they weren't giving him any options."It's gonna be like that huh?", 'Caleb' spoke shaking his head, "Fine...the easy way would've been boring. *zoom*"He quickly teleports behind from the group to their surprise and quickly grabs a nearby gutting knife making a horizontal stab for Drei's neck. The weasel quickly leans backwards avoiding the attack while extending her small blades knocking the blade from his hand sending it flying across the room. She twists her body a full 360 degrees ( mustelid spine) grabbing his arms about to inject the serum before he teleports away again making he fall to the floor on all fours.Caleb appears standing atop the couch laughing boisterously as body proceeds to glow with purple aura with eyes taking on a menacing purple hue and malicious toothy smile crossing his lips."Boss, don't make us do this!", Zwei stated getting in attack position a bit reluctantly."I think we're past talking, Pervert.", Caleb stated as purple flamelike aura covered his arms growing denser while her smirks in intrigue, "Hmm, let's give this a try. DEEP PURPLE!"He fires a the purple aura at Zwei but she quickly dodges overhead as it impacts with a loud explosives pulse leaving the floor and stools scorched. Zwei bounces off the air about to tackle him but he repels her back with a barrier. While distracted Ein knock him off balance from behind about to pin him on his stomach to the couch. He quickly teleports, to her surprise next to her and attempts to knee her in the head which she instinctively blocks with her elbow but gets repelled by a pulse of purple aura knocking her on her back. 'Caleb' smiles in satisfaction about to pounce on her. Suddenly, Lyca grabs him from behind restraining his arms."Chief! Please stop! Please!", the She-wolf cried out desperately as her struggled in her grasp. Mirabelle watches in horror at the chaos around her wanting and praying just for everything to go back to normal. Zwei rushes over with some rope to assist her."Get OFF ME, mutt!", Caleb shouted at her before teleporting out grasp then performing a judo throw tossing the werewolf right into Zwei. Zwei catches her and the hit the floor before eyes widen in shock seeing him charging another blast of purple aura smiling maliciously....Inside, real Caleb could get seen thrashing and struggling to get free a Heather laughs happily watching the show and ignoring him. His breathing was rapid and sharp barely containing his seething rage as purple jolts of electricity pulsars from all over his body. More of the chains start cracking....'Caleb' fires at them but it's blocked by a large blue magic seal. The shockwave blowing a section of the couch back and flipping the coffee table over. He turns to Camilla seeing her glaring at him. He takes one steps and is immediately stopped by several green magic seals surrounding him."Do not take uno mas step, Señor!", Camilla threatens"Or what? You gonna kill me too?", Caleb accuses in a jeering tone."I would NEVER hurt ju Senor...but I will stop ju.", Camilla spoke sadly while glaring as if urging herself to proceed."Well GET ON WITH IT THEN YOU WORTHLESS MURDERING WHORE!", Caleb screams at her.Camilla reluctantly snaps his fingers green surges on electricity illuminates his body."AHHHHHHhhhhhhhh...", Caleb hollers out loud before dying it down showing her was faking and totally fine, "Just kidding."Camilla gives a profoundly confused expression."Surprised? You must've known I can create BARRIERS including less visible ones to cover my whole body if I got enough stamina. Which I'm starting to get low on, so I'll just hurry up.", 'Caleb' says before teleporting out of the magic seal trap, to Camilla shock, appearing behind her immediately grabbing her tail."NNNAAGH!", Camilla screams out feel her body tremble becoming weak."Yeah, I bet that feels good but how about THIS!?", 'Caleb' stated yanking her tail hard forcing down on her hands and knees as she whimpers."S-Senor...por fa vor...", Camilla utters from the pain looking to him pleadingly."Heh, how pitiful, such an obvious weakspot.", 'Caleb' taunted before grabbing a nearby butcher knife positioning it at the midsection to her horror, "How's about I remove that weakness?""No! NONONONO!", Camilla pleaded furiously shaking her head with tears in her eyes."Stop!", Ein called out wanting to rush him but afraid what he'll do to Camilla.'Caleb' smiles licking his lips at her now pathetic demeanor.Inside, real Caleb could be seen straining prepared to tear his arm from their sockets get to free from his restraints. His eyes with purple flames of seering rage as ripples of purple energy emanated from his body. The cracks in the restraints propagate more and more."STOP!", Mirabelle called out getting his attention falling to her knees in despair. She looks to him with waterfalls of tears pouring down her cheeks, "I'm begging you please, stop."'Caleb' looks to her a moment then places the butcher knife down. He then teleports in front of her, kneels down, and siezes her by the throat with one hand."Mira!", Lyca stated trying to approach as do the others....Insides, real Caleb was now at his breaking point. The cracks in the chains spreading more and more...."Get the fuck back before I rip her throat out!", Caleb threatens as the others come to a halt. He then looks back to Mirabelle who looked back him trembling with fear and gasp for air, "You better be glad we need you alive bitch."Mirabelle had no idea what he meant as a hurricane of emotions filled her mind. 'Caleb' then looks down at her skirt with a perverted grin."Of course, who's to say I can't have some fun?", he spoke lifting her skirt as she shut her eyes. The others watch in horror....Inside, real Caleb had enough using all the strength he had forces his own lips leaving bloody patching of ripped skin and, with all his might, screams."MOON PIE!"...This chains break and the platform crumble much to the shock of Heather as purple energy surged throughout the area. Caleb falls to the floor glaring at her intensely before charging at her full speed like a quarterback."What the fu-GAH!", Heather screamed before getting tackled to the floor.Back to Mirabelle, her eyes were shut but she suddenly hears a voice echo in her head. A loud, very familiar voice. Dear's voice. He removes his grip from her neck as she looks to him confused seeing his blank expression noticing the look in his eyes had changed. He removes his trembling hand at her skirt balling it to a fist. To everyone's surprise, he slugs himself hard in the face knocking himself back to the floor. He flails on the floor striking himself in stomach and across the face giving himself a bloody nose. The girls were profoundly confused seeing the man now beating HIMSELF up. All the while, making a kind of distorted groaning soundHe flips himself over grabbing his throat with both hands proceeding to choke himself....Inside, real Caleb had Heather pinned to floor choking her as tried prying him find the purple energy rippling throughout her ghostly form causing pain. Actual pain.Outside, Mirabelle rushes to him attempting stop him."DEAR!""Gahh s-stay...away...moon pie..."Mirabelle stops in her tracks hearing his voice in her head again then seeing the pleading expression in his eyes as he choked himself. There was a twinkle in his eye that caught her attention as he continued to strangle himself."Get back Señora!", Camilla says stepping in front of her shielding her while unsure of what to make of the scene.Inside, Caleb and Heather struggled on the floor."Get offa me! I can't control this space with you on top!", Heather stated struggling to get free."Fucking bitch! You're gonna pay! You fuck with MY girls, you're gonna PAY!", He barked at her"Let me go! What is even your plan?! You gonna kill yourself...for them?!", Heather screamed telepathically."If that's what it takes, yeah", Caleb spoke back with a serious look in his eyes.Heather eyes widen in shock and fear, "W- WHAT ARE YOU, SUICIDAL?!""YOU FUCKED WITH MY HEAD LONG ENOUGH! YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT BY NOW.", Caleb screamed back as the atmosphere grew heavy and the window to the outside began flickering outHeather started to panic. She always ditched a body right BEFORE they were gonna die. She knew if she stayed any longer she'd end up dying with his soul."NO! LET GO! LET ME OUT. GIVE ME ANOTHER BODY. GIVE ME THAT DEVIL'S BODY!", Heather screamed desperately punching and clawing at Caleb to get free. He would not let go no matter what."YOU'RE NOT GET ANY BODY! YOU STUCK WITH MY SHIT FOREVER BITCH!"Right as he says that, he feels a sharp pain in his chest and his entire body feels numb as before he collapses lifeless on top of Heather. She struggles to pry his heavy body off to know avail. She notices the windows of soul growing darker as fear crept through his senses that this was the end....Outside, Drei knelt by his body have stuck the sedative covered dart in his chest. His breathing slows as he releases his neck going unconcious. Drei stood up looking to him a bit sadly."D-Drei, look! His arms!", Zwei pointed out in panic.Drei looks shocked to see the same makes as Burns spreading up his arms starting from the wrists. She look to Mirabelle and the rest seeing the fearful expressions. She sighs realizing it was too late and clenching her fists. Mirabelle looks to Caleb feeling as if something was calling to her....Some time later...The Zyklons brought Caleb to their house, while making sure not to touch the marks or fear of contracting the parasite, keeping him contained in the panic room. Drei chose to monitor his condition closely while keeping him sedated with moderate doses of her medicine.Meanwhile, Ein and Zwei were busy attempting to do damage control among the girls. It was quiet. Camilla, Lyca, and Mirabelle sat in different parts of the living room not talking. All still reeling from the events that have transpired in their once peaceful home. Ein made some tea to try calm their nerves but they didn't accept it. Zwei looks to Ein unsure of what to do before suddenly the front door unlocks catching their attention and in steps Drei. The girls immediately rise up going to her."Sis! H-How is he?", Zwei asked in a worried tone.Drei pauses seeing the expectant looks on their faces. She sighs, "The marks have spread to his upper and lower neck and his vital signs are dropping steadily. His body is fighting the parasite but it isn't enough. At this rate...I'm afraid he'll be dead by morning."The news hit the others like enormous weight crushing their chests. The pain they felt was indescribable as if someone had stabbed a blade through their chest cutting up to their heart."No.", Lyca utters tail clenches between her legs as she stumble backwards back hitting the couch as sliding to a seated position while clenching her aching chest, "NO NO NO NO NO! CHIEF!", she cries shaking her head.Zwei reaches to her but stops seeing the sheer pain in her eyes. Tears started forming in hers as well.Mirabelle stood dead silent trying to comprehend what she just heard. It had to be a mistake. There's no way this was happening! It didn't make sense! It HAD to be some cruel, sick joke!"Lies.", Camilla utters her body trembling. The others look to her and were caught off guard when she snatches up Drei by her collar slamming her up against the door, "JU ARE LYING!""Ms. Sartana!", Ein stated ready to restrain her before Drei gestures her 'No'."I'm not lying to you. This is the truth.", Drei spoke plainly irritating the Elder Devil."NO!", Camilla yells in anger slams her against back against the door again, "Ju are just being lazy! If ju call yourself a healer THEN GET OVER THERE AND HEAL HIM!""I don't know what I'm dealing with. If I administer drugs at random I risk spreading the infection even more or worse. We were too late.", Drei spoke as Mirabelle and the rest watch them."NO! Ju are not TRYING hard enough. Ju cannot say that mi Destino is going to die! THAT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE!", Camilla screams in rage and sadness before forming a red magic seal in Drei's face, "I do not care what it takes, what we need or how much more blood I must spill, just SAVE him!"Drei touches her arm tenderly to Camilla surprise, "I know. But you have to believe me. I've done all I could for now."Camilla expression softens a moment before clenching her eyes to stifle the sobs. She tosses Drei to the floor behind her, "I do not know WHY I'm wasting time with ju. It YOUR fault this happened to him! Fine. I will help him myself.", she spoke turning to the front door."Stop! You'll just get yourself infected too!", Drei stated picking herself up as Ein rushes past her."I will take my chances.", Camilla says opening the door only for Ein to force it shut."Listen to her, Camilla! You don't know what you're doing!""Get out of the way.", Camilla glared at her red aura radiated from her body. Ein stands her ground refusing to let her through."No. You have to list-", Ein spoke glaring back at her.Camilla quickly forms a stack of three red magic seals at her fist throwing a punch at Ein. The wind weasel dodges deflecting the attack off it's course then delivering a solid jab into her stomach making Camila lurch forward from the blow before delivering a knee kick that the sent the Elder Devil back a few feets Camilla grunts from the pain glaring at Ein who stood over her."C-Camilla, ple-!", Mirabelle utters but Camilla ignores rushing the busty weasel."RHAAA!", Camilla screams throwing a series of punches and kicks with Ein skillfully managing to block or dodge them. Suddenly, Camilla unfurls her wings performing a spin move that smacks Ein across the face then following with an uppercut to the weasel's jaw. Ein stumbles back to her sister surprise holding her jaw and spitting a little blood before looking to Camilla angrily hissing and baring her fangs."Hey! Hey come on sis! Stop!", Zwei stated.Ein goes into a fighting dance as Camilla rushes her again. Two engage throwing fists and kicks back and forth both blocking and dodging but each getting a bit into the other. Mirabelle watches with a deeply saddened look as her family was falling apart."Stop fighting! STOP!", Lyca cried out holding the sides of her head as Ein and Camilla interlock attempting to pin the other to the counter knocking over chairs and items left on top.Mirabelle felt her heart racing and breathing heavily as purple energy began to build around her body."Knock it off you two!", Zwei stated as she and Drei tried to separate the two of them. Camilla curses at Ein who hurls her own insults back."STOOOPP!", Mirabelle shouts as a pulse of purple aura ripples throughout the rooms covering everyone. Immediately, their bodies go numb ceasing any action and their eyes become glazed over as silence befell the room. The Nightmare catches her breath a moment before noticing what she's done and quickly releases her hold on their psyches. They all sharply gasp collecting their surroundings."All of you...stop this.", Mirabelle spoke sadly trembling before teleporting out of the room leaving them alone. Lyca frowns hugging her knees as Camilla and Ein slide down to the floor losing any will to fight instead feeling shame. Zwei looks plops down unsure what to do anymore."I do not understand.", Camilla spoke somberly as Ein looks to her wiping the blood from her mouth, "Everything was fine this morning. We were so happy. I was happy...for the first time in years I was happy. So why?""Camilla...", Ein spoke going to her side."The worst part is...I still love him. Despite everything he said I STILL love him.", Camilla utters her voice cracking as breaks into sobbing, "POR QUE?!"Ein pulls her into a hug which Camilla doesn't resist the gesture. Lyca crawls to whimpering as well before embracing Camilla as well. Zwei covers her eyes hiding her tears as Drei hung her head down before stand up."It's not his fault. Remember NONE of what he said is how he truly feels. He's just sick. He's just sick...", Drei assured with a low tone before turning around, "I'm going to monitor him. I'll call when I'm sure it's sage to see him...one last time.""Ok.", Zwei spoke in a hollow tone.Drei exits the house still hearing Camilla and Lyca sobbing from behind the door and takes a deep breath and exhales before proceeding. It was going to be a long night....Mirabelle's room...The Nightmare stood by her window clutching her sailor moon doll softly whimpering. She looks up at the night sky to the crescent moon hand overhead contemplating everything he told her and how THOSE would be his last words to her. She then remembers the voice she heard in her head. HIS voice calling out to her. Whatsmore, she remembered sensing a strange energy from within him much different from normal. Then there was that spark in his eye when he strangled himself.Mirabelle grips the plush tighter resolving to get to the bottom of this....In the panic room...Caleb lays on the couch unconcious breathing lethargically as the markings slowly spread. The skin on his face could be seen peeling as tiny open sores appeared on his armsDrei could be seen wearing a small green ICEP issued hazmat suit( a personal request of hers) and administering a drug to help lessen his pain. She looks to him somberly seeing how much he was suffering. Camilla was right. This was her fault. She should've chosen him."I'm sorry.", Drei whispered removing the syringe.Only thing now she could do was take away his pain even a little. What else could she do?...inside Caleb's head..."Uh...aghh...wha?", real Caleb groan stirring himself awake seeing he was on the floor surrounded in a void of blackness. He tried to stand only to collapse back down as his legs had no strength. He groans before pulling up his jogging pant legs seeing the hideous glowing yellow veiny mark horried to find them covering his arms and even his torso. A sudden intense pain shoots through every nerve in his body as yellow sparks pulsate from the veiny marks. It was worse than when Azaeli tortured him."Well, look who's finally awake.", remarks Heather as she materialized from green miasma in front of him, "Gotta say, you had me pretty scared there for a while. I actually I would be joining you at the pearly gates. Aka the glory hole at the truck stop in Tuscaloosa. You know the one.""Nnnnghh w-whats happening to me?", Caleb spoke weakly feeling another wave of pain wash over him." 'Possession Poisioning' at least that's what I call it, not sure about other ghosts. Basically, I've just about drained your soul for all it's worth. Might I add your spirit energy is fucking delicious, although...I would much preferred taking it the old fashioned way.", Heather chortle pulling up her shirt exposing a ripple ghostly tail rubbing an are and show her womanhood that leaked neon green ooze, "You lasted longer than expected. Be happy, many girls wouldn't give a guy that kinda feedback. However..."Heather appears in front of him. A greenish-white miasma appears on Caleb's neck chocking him as she telekinetically lifts him up. She glared angrily her eyes glowing a menacing green."That little stunt you pulled royally PISSED me off! You could've killed me probably! This power of yours comes from that Nightmare huh? It's some crazy shit but not crazy enough to save you.", Heather spoke coldly clenching her fist as Caleb gag clawing at the miasma before green electric jolts light up his body making him elicit choke cries in pain. The glowing veins spread further now covering his face. Heather throwing her head back in orgasmic bliss before smiling wickedly, "Ohhh GOD you're good, baby. Of all the souls I've consumed, yours is the best. God your good!"Caleb's arms and legs go limp as his body flickers as if his form was becoming unstable. Heather releases him letting him fall to his back motionless. His gaze was unfocused but he could still comprehend his surroundings. Heather then straddles his chest rubbing up his chest hungrily."Shhh relax baby and become part of me and live on for eternity with the others. As soon as I take you, I'll leave this vessel and take the closest one nearby. And it looks like that happens to be the loli weasel. HA! I still can't believe they're actually sisters! Personally, I'd prefer the bigger thiccer one or definitely that thicc ass Devil.", Heather spoke drooling at the thought.Caleb gave a horrified look before noticing the surroundings changing rippling with shades of purple aura and mist. Heather then grabs his neck with both hands strangling him."You like this? Did know choke sex was you kink too. Why don't you relax and give in already. It's not like those girls will miss you when you're gone. Not after everything you said.", Heather spoke teasingly."Moon...pie...", Caleb uttered as Heather notices he wasn't even looking at her."Ha...HaHAHAHAHAHA ARE YOU SEROUS!? Pretty lame last words.", Heather taunted choking him harder, "She can't hear you. Nobody can. It's just you and me here.""Actually...", came another voice that caught Heather off guard before-STAB"GAHHH!", Heather screamed lurching backward off Caleb seeing a blade impaled through her torso. She looks behind her eyes widen in shock as Caleb looks behind her a small smile growing seeing his wife. Mirabelle stood over them with her DreamScythe surrounded in flame-like purple aura with pure rage in her glowing purple eyes."I can hear MY Dear just fine!", Mirabelle stated before lifting Heather off of and tossing her across space as she hollered out.She turns to Caleb hurrying to see about him kneeling down horrified at the glowing veins covering him head to toe."Moon...pie...", Caleb utters."It's alright. I'm here my love.""Sorry...so sorry...It wasn't me...", Caleb uttered getting teary eyed before she wipes his tears away."I know. I know it wasn't. Now please save your strength.", Mirabelle reassures before looking to where she tossed Heather seeing her standing, so to speak, huffing as the sound healed while glaring at Mirabelle viciously. Mirabelle raises to her feet brandishing her scythe, "I'll protect you.""So, the prissy purple prewd makes her appearance. Given what I saw about you from his memory I figured you'd be crying yourself all night for mean things your man said.", Heather taunted puffing her bottom lip making the 'Boohoohoo' gesture with her hands."You. It was you all along making Dear act like a complete goon! Who and what are you?!", Mirabelle demanded unaware of small plumes of green miasma forming below her."Name's Heather and I'm a ghost. Now if we're done with the interview...*snap*", Heather snaps her fingers as the green miasma clouds explode enveloping Mirabelle body. However, Mirabelle swings her scythe cleaning multiple times through the thick green energy completely dispelling it.Suddenly, Heather appears behind her with her nails extended into razorsharp blades about to slash her but Mirabelle blocks her with a barrier. She swings her scythe at the ghost making a few cuts in the space around her but not hitting the ghost. Heather dodges just in time putting a bit of distance between them. She then notices how Mirabelle was positioning herself to prevent her from getting close to Caleb."Ohh, I see you don't want me getting close to him. Well sorry to break it to ya War Horse but he's good as dead. I've just about drained him dry of all his spirit energy. So why don't you be a good little Nightmare, put the scythe down and come quietly before anyone else gets hurt. I've got a mission to carry out. I don't wanna have to resort to drastic-er urges.", Heather propositions.Mirabelle looks to Caleb a second gripping her scythe then back to Heather, "Out there, you said you needed me alive. I presume that means I'm who you're after.""Bingo! Look at you catching on quick.""If that's the case, then leave my Dear out of this! I'll do whatever you ask just spare him! Give him back the spirit energy you've taken!", Mirabelle stated."Hmm, interesting proposal buuut you've got it all wrong. You think we JUST want you?! Don't flatter yourself! Our client wants to see him dead!", Heather stated in cheerful sadistic tone.Mirabelle eyes widen in shock before gripping her scythe tighter, "I see.""Hm?""You said 'we' and 'our'. I can guess there are others like you. Not ghosts perhaps. Otherwise, I'd be swarmed by now.", Mirabelle says looking to Heather, "Allies of yours? How many?"Heather gives and annoyed frown, "Tch, as if I'd tell you goddamn thing!", she stated before compressing a ball green miasma and firing it at Mirabelle with intense speed. It explodes on impact with her barrier as Mirabelle tenses slightly from the power it packed."That's fine.", Mirabelle spoke calmly but glaring sternly, "I'll find out all I need soon enough."Heather growled in irritation, "We'll see about that bitch! Oh, and if you plan on saving your fancy black hubby, I'd do it quick. I'd say he has about 15 minutes give or take a minute or two."The revelation shocked Mirabelle realizing she needed to hurry. Fortunately, she was in familiar territory."Well, I only need five. If you've seen inside Dear's mind, then you know that I know his dreamscape like the back of my hand. I total dominion here. Allow me to demonstrate.", Mirabelle stated confidently twirling her scythe before dramatically slamming the bottom end to the ground. She waited a moment surprised that the dimension hadn't changed at all. Heather looks around unimpressed and playfully shrugs. Mirabelle taps the grounds a multiple times confused and starting to panic."Awww what's wrong? What happened to having total dominion?", Heather taunted with a wide grin.Mirabelle keeps tapping the ground desperately, "N-No! Why?!""Simple. YOU don't have total dominion over this place anymore.", Heather mocked much to Mirabelle shock, "I've basically made myself at home in his psyche. This space is entirely made of my astral power which gets stronger the more of his spirit energy I consume!""No!", Mirabelle calls out channeling some purple energy through her scythe shaft and slamming it to the floor. It destabilized space for a moment before being the space returns to normal to Mirabelle's fear."Oh, and FYI. I've kinda been pulling my punches this whole time. Decided to give you a little hope...before I shit on it.", Heather spoke with a deep menacing tone as her body radiated menacing green fire-like aura. Wave of green energy rippling throughout the dimension forcing Mirabelle to shield herself and Caleb.*For immersion, play Black Goku theme.*Heather's body transforms with her green swirling ghost tail becomes a pair of slender human legs with pulsating green veins the same was on her arms. Her long sleeve gown became a dark green halter backless slit top that reach down her legs, black shorts, black ankle length heeled boots, and her hair silver hair now had streaks of green. She smiles at Mirabelle showing a set of viciously sharp teeth and piercing green eyes coupled with sharp needlelike nails.Mirabelle could feel the tremendous increase in astral energy around her as fear began to creep in through her senses."Hehehehe judging by that look on your face, I guess you're starting to understand now", Heather says before suddenly appear right in front of Mirabelle surprising her. Mirabelle swings her scythe only to find herself swinging at empty before have her hair grabbed from behind yanking it back hard as yelped in pain. Heather forces her head back and whispers in her ear, "You're in MY house now, bitch."Heather kicks Mirabelle hard in the back making the Centaur faceplant on the ground. Mirabelle quickly tries the pick herself up using her scythe as support. Heather makes her arm stretch like Luffy from One Piece launching it with her sharp clawed fingers like a spear. Mirabelle parried the hit creating a shower of sparks from the impact on. Heather fingers spread open forming as a ball of green energy in front of Mirabelle. It explodes in her face sending her sliding back before catching her footing. Her barrier absorbed most of the power but she still took some damage evident. She hunches slightly from the pain. Heather keeps up the pressure appearing above smiling with her tongue pulled out brandishing her needle claws rippling with green aura.She thrusts both spear hands with manic ferocity as Mirabelle tries desperately to parry the hits getting cut a few times. T"Hahahaha come on, you can do better than THAT!", Heather chortle enthusiastically creating an opening before kneeing Mirabelle hard in her human torso."KYAGH-Gaah?!", Mirabelle cough hunching over attempting to send out a pulse of aura before Heather grabs her face breaking her concentration."Bitch move!", Heather chortled before sending a strong torrent of green energy ripping through Mirabelle's body."AAAHHHHHHH!", she screams out as green lightning pulsates from her now destabilizing astral body. Her arms go limp as she drops her scythe. The object vanishes into a spread of tiny purple energy particles.Heather releases her stepping back satisfaction as Mirabelle wobbles trying to remain standing her body becoming heavy and flickering before she collapses on her side. Her body keeps flickering like an unstable satellite signal."Hahaha looks like you're astral form is almost at it's limit. One more and I wonder what'll happen. Will your physical body die or will it just recall it's astral body back?", Heather says generating a large green ball of miasma energy before dissipating it with a sigh, "Guess we won't know since I can't kill ya."She notices Mirabelle reaching her hand out looking with half lidded eyes at Caleb still lying on the ground breathing laboriously. The yellow veiny mark now starting to completely cover his face."Dear...", Mirabelle spoke softly."What? You scared and want your Dear to hold your hand? Ah riiight cuz he looooves you SO much!", Heather sarcastically swooned before stopping her on Mirabelle hand, "What a load of bullshit! Acting like you two are SO happy together! You're both just a couple of fucked up asshole that found each other! How could ANY normal guy love someone like you?! A worthless, ugly, pathetic, loser COWARD!", she reviled in irritation before spitting on Mirabelle head.Mirabelle shuddered feeling every word sting to her core."Tch, yeah you cry those little bitch tears but makes sure to dry your eyes enough to watch me kill your lover. Brb.", Heather says brandishing her claws catwalking over to Caleb.Mirabelle watches helplessly, her body refusing to move, as her words bombard in her mind. She tried her best and she still couldn't protect him. She failed him. Tears started to well in her eyes before..."Moon pie...", came the voice of Caleb with her head. She looks to see him turned to weakly reaching his trembling hand out to her.Her eyes widen in surprise. Even in this state, she could still feel his heart calling out to her. He still loved her. He trusted her.'What am I doing? Why am I listening to her rubbish while the only person who's words truly matter are about to be silenced. Caleb has always been by my side. He's my best friend. My lover! My husband who gives a 100% for me!", Mirabelle thought clenching her fist in determination, 'What kind of wife am I...TO NOT GIVE 100% FOR HIM?'Suddenly, to Mirabelle surprise, little glowing spheres of purple energy from the dimension surrounding her. She senses something very familiar about them. They didn't just feel like he energy...but Caleb's as well.Sidenote: It has often been said that ' salvation comes in the blink of an eye'. For Mirabelle, salvation comes from the residual astral energy within Caleb's subconscious that she unconsciously summoned to her aid.The balls of energy start getting absorbed into her body and she feels her strength returning and most of her wound healing.Caleb vision was blurry but he could make out the terrifying image of Heather standing over him brandishing her needle nails like a spear smiling creepily."Haaa kinda wish things had been different. I would've loved taking that big black cock for a ride.", Heather spoke rubbing her foot against his crotch then pressing hard getting ready to impale him, "Welp, there'll be plenty more fun to have when this is done!"Heather strikes at his chest but was surprised for her claws to come nowhere near his body; instead shattering on impact with a very dense purple energy barrier."Wah! Wha?!", Heather gasps looking at her hand then sees the barrier around Caleb, "The fu-Ah!", she stated whipping her head around only for Mirabelle to grasp her head with both hands forcing her to make eye contact."In your dreams!", Mirabelle stated her eyed filled with purple flames. Heather gasps mouth agape as her eyes take on the same purple glow....Mirabelle is bombarded with images of Heather life; formerly Heather J. Fernsby born in Augusta, Maine in the mid-80s. She had brown hair, blue eyes, and a skinny figure with flat chest and butt. They told the story of how she grew up in an overly strict and devout Catholic household where she was harshly punished by her parents for whatever they deemed 'sinful'. She was an only child and had no friends. She was bullied alot in middle school for skinny appearance and plain dress style. Things only got worse as she entered into high school. Not only did her parents bare down on her even harder warning her of the 'temptations of the flesh and mind', but she was relentlessly bullied for her appearance and the reputation of her parents in the town; eventually given the name 'Parasite'. The worst of her bullies, Angela, the queen bee of her school, made her life an absolute hell for Heather and spread terrible rumors about her. The images also showed her growing sexual curiosity, especially her interest in both men AND women which she had to keep from her parents. It didn't help that they made her despise her own sexuality. Everyday at school, she was forced to watch happy couples being all lovey-dovey. The envy she felt toward Angela and the other perfect girls with their perfect bodies able to woo the boys easily. She even had a crush on Angela boyfriend, Chase, but he openly rebuffs her calling her ugly which hurt her deeply. Everyday she was reminded of how ugly, worthless, and how nobody would EVER want a Jesus freak Parasite like her. She hated it. Her body, her parents, the school, Angela, everything!That all changed when one day she was walking home from school and came across a strange round black stone with mysterious symbols carves into it. She picked it up and immediately felt a strange sensation all over her body. When looking up, she could've sworn she saw a feminine figure in a dark purple cloak observing her. She noted her greyish skin and appeared to be carrying some kind of book. She ignored deciding to continue on home passing some construction workers on the road and fantasizing about one of them coming up to flirt with her. She was unaware of the truck speeding down the road adjacent and colliding right into her. Next shows Heather final thoughts. How she realized she was really dying and slowly realizing how awful her life truly was. She never got to go out on a date or even have a first kiss! Was she seriously going to die a loser virgin?! Seriously!? She refused to accept THAT as her fate. At that moment, a strange green energy filled her vision. She awoke some time later shocked by her new appearance. She was a ghost. Not only that, she was angry and very horny.Next shows Heather quickly coping with the idea that she was dead, even attending her own funeral, before deciding to have her revenge against everyone who wronged her. She soon discovered her ability to possess living being. After some practice with animals and homeless people, she was ready for her targets. Starting with Angela, who she used to have sloppy sex with her boyfriend before killing him, then making Angela strip naked and masterbate in front of her entire class before slicing her throat to the teacher and Angela friends horror. She then went after her friends, possessing, having sex with boys, until their bodies were used up or making them commit suicide. When she was done with the school, she turned her attention to her parents. She possessed her own mother and forces her to beat her husband to death with a fireplace poker while shooting off quotes from Leviticus. She then proceeds open the oven turning on the gas the setting her parents and her own bedroom on fire. She leaves the burning house getting into her parents car and driving off as it explodes. For the first time, she felt free but she knew that this freedom required a fresh body every now and again. That's how she would spend the next couple decades up until her inevitable encounter with Satella's group.Mirabelle continues diving deeper through her psyche before finally finding what she was looking for....Heather gasps quickly glancing around looking to Caleb who was still on the ground. The yellow veiny mark covering his entire body. She then looks to Mirabelle, still on the ground from the ass whooping she just gave her. Heather gaze lingers on Mirabelle a moment. She could've sworn that Centaur was up in her face a second ago."Eh, whatever.", Heather shrugs before turning her attention back to Caleb and extending her needle-nails, "Back to business as usual.""Please...", Mirabelle uttered weakly trembling as she looks to Heather with pleading eyes, "Please, I'm begging you. I know you don't want to do this. Please!"Heather give her an indifferent look, "You really are a coward until the end. You think I DON'T want to do this?""Huh?!", Mirabelle gasps in shock."Truth is...", Heather spoke a wicked grin forming, "I LIVE FOR THIS! IT'S JUST TOO MUCH FUN! SAY BYE-BYE TO HUBBY!""NOOO!", Mirabelle screams out in despair as Heather stabs her claws right into Caleb's chest.Heather smiles in satisfaction but then was shocked when Caleb's body poofs away as a cloud of purple smoke. She also found that her claws were stuck in the ground not budging no matter how hard she pulled."What? What the fuck is this?!""Haa I truly gave you a chance. I thought there might be a sliver of humanity left in you.", Mirabelle spoke as Heather turns her attention to her surprised to find the Centaur standing to her feet just fine. Her injuries all vanishes in steams of purple mist, "But I know better. I know EXACTLY who you are now.""We'll see about that, you stupid bitch! HA!", Heather stated charging up a ball of green miasma and firing it at Mirabelle.Mirabelle raises her hand stops it in mid-air to Heather shock before radiating purple aura from her body. The green miasma changed into a ball of purple energy which she then absorbed into her body.Heather clenches her teeth in frustration attempting to teleport over to her only to find she was still in the same spot. Whatsmore, she realized she could no longer feel Caleb spirit energy. She then remembers when Mirabelle was up in her face and a blinding purple light."W-What did you-""Have you finally noticed it yet? Your power is fading", Mirabelle say in a cold tone, "When I dived into your wretched psyche, I took it upon myself to sever the astral link you've attached to Dear's. You won't be leeching off him anymore.""What?!", Heather stated in disbelief."Oh. Apologies, let me put it this way. You claimed earlier this was YOUR house. Well, I just handed you an eviction notice!", Mirabelle stated before summoning her DreamScythe back to her hand."I-Impossible! How could a worthless, coward like you-""Yes!", Mirabelle stated cutting her off, "I am still a coward...but now...i'm also loved."Mirabelle stomps her hoof making a clopping sound that echoes as the darkness around her dissolves away replaced with purple energy and mist. Heather looks around in shock as the dimension destabilizes."It's because of that I refuse to lose to you. Someone who was denied real love throughout her life and in her death destroyed it for countless others. ", Mirabelle says walking toward her as the darkness dissolves more and more until it was entirely replaced by the dreamscape to Heather's horror, "Yet, you needed them. You needed their feelings, their power, their lives since it was the only way you could feel alive. However, the sad truth is...you can live a MILLION of their lives...and still be everything your abusers said you are. A parasite."Heather glared at her hatefully as green and black flames covered her body, "Don't CALL ME THAT!", she shouted before firing a torrent of green lightning at Mirabelle. It was absorbed by her barrier not slowing her stride at all. Heather start to panic at the advancing Nightmare trying to pull her arm out of the ground but it wouldn't budge.Mirabelle raises her scythe and slices her left hand off leaving it stuck in the ground."GAAHHHH!", Heather cries out in pain cradling the glow green nub where her hand used to be. Mirabelle slams the end of her scythe onto her severed hand and it disappears in a puff of green particles to Heather's horror. She looks up at Mirabelle haunting figure glaring down with disdain."I may have feelings worthlessness...but you really ARE worthless.", Mirabelle remarks."RHHAA!", Heather yells out pointing her free hand attempting to channel green miasma energy for another attack only for her aura to fizzle out to her shock. She realizes she was running out of spirit energy and need to pull more in fast. She looks around frantically but didn't see him. Hell, she couldn't sense his energy anywhere."Looking for something...or perhaps someone? Well, you won't find my Caleb here.", Mirabelle says in a serious tone as Heather looks to her confused, "Doesn't this space feel quite different from before?"Heather gives a look of realization finally noticing the surroundings."When I peered into your psyche, I also pulling you into mine. You're not inside Dear's dreamscape, you're inside mine!", Mirabelle emphasizes striking the ground with her scythe end the sound echoing before..."SAILOR KICK", screams an unknown voice catching Heather attention who recieves a flying kick to the head by none other than Sailor Moon herself."Nnagh! Erghh! The f-", Heather stops mid-sentence shocked to see the five Sailor Scouts standing beside Mirabelle in their signature poses and staring her down intently. Heather give a confused look, "What the FUCK is all this?""Been awhile, Ms. Mira.", Serena(Sailor Moon) spoke playfully to Mirabelle."What is our objective, Ma'am?", Amy(Sailor Mercury) inquires respectfully."I need you to do what you all do best, love!", Mirabelle stated pointing her scythe at Heather who flinches in fear."Right!" , all the scouts stated before charging the ghost girl."Whoawhoawhoa WAIT A SEC HERE!" , Heather waved her hands in vain trying to stop the beating that was coming."MERCURY BUBBLE! FREEZE!", Amy(Sailor Mercury) shouted as Heather was body was frozen in ice."POWER OF MARS! PHEONIX FIREBOLT CHARGE!", Sailor Mars shouted sending a fireball that takes the form of a bird crashes right into Heather setting her whole body ablaze as she screams out in pain."JUPITER THUNDER DRAGON!", Sailor Jupiter called out in righteous fury sending a huge torrent of lightning that takes the form of a Chinese dragon that lights up Heather like a Christmas tree."METEOR SHOWER!", Sailor Venus calls out shooting a yellow ball of energy upwards before it explodes in a shower of thousands of other balls that pelt Heather's entire body like hard baseballs."MOON GORGEOUS MEDITATION!", Sailor Moon finishes her off twirling her staff as beam of rainbow energy erupts below Heather making her scream out in agony as if her body was being ripped apart.Heather entire body flickers and glitches like a damages computer screen before falling on her butt losing the strength to stand. Mirabelle approaches her as Sailor Scouts all vanish. The ghost girl weakly looks up at her unable to utter a coherent word from how much pain she was in."I believe you have something that doesn't belong to you.", Mirabelle says before clenching her fist making a pulling motion.Immediately, a stream of purple energy erupts out of Heather body making her gag and twitch as it collects in Mirabelle palm into a tight glowing ball then absorbing it into her own body. Heather's body reverts back to its original form including her ghost tail in place of legs. Mirabelle then raises her scythe much to Heather's horror."No. No, please... Don't destroy me!", Heather pleads on her hand, "Please I beg you!""Do you believe you deserve that? All the lives you've destroyed for your own selfish whims?!", Mirabelle coldly replies remembering all the terrible things she saw in her memories."I don't! I know I don't! I-I-I just...I just wanted to have fun. You know? Enjoy all life has to offer! Food, booze, SEX! I just wanted to be FREE!", Heather stated trying to plead her case while channeling what little energy she had into her hand."And the PRICE of that freedom? People like my Dear Caleb?!", Mirabelle retorted."Come on! Give me a break! You already took his spirit energy back. I'm on my last nonexistent legs here! I-I promise if you let me go, you'll never see me again! I-I'll tell you everything about Satella and-", Heather begged before Mirabelle interupts."I know about all of that already."Heather falls silent trembling as she discretely channeled her energy in her palm waiting for her chance."I'm not going to kill you.", Mirabelle says turning away to Heather's surprise, "That's not the way of my people.""Too bad.", Heather spoke under her breath channel green miasma in her claws then lunges for Mirabelle neck, "CUZ MY WAYS MORE FUN!"Suddenly, to her shock, Heather body comes to a complete hault being held in place by an invisible force as the green miasma is dissipated."I was waiting for you to use the last of your energy. The only thing making you different from anything else in this realm. Now that's gone, so now...your indistinguishable from any other thought in my head.", Mirabelle calmly informs before raising her scythe and making four slices in space forming a perfect square. She steps aside and the space she cut emits a blinding purple light that shine upon Heather making her shut her eyes.Heather then feels her body being pulled towards the square."W-What is this?! What are you doing to me?!", Heather inquired starting to panic."I told you that I won't KILL you...that doesn't mean you won't be punished.", Mirabelle says her words laced with venom, "This is a special technique of my clan. One made for thoughts as toxic as yourself. However, I made this special for you."Before Heather could speak, several arms reach out of the opens grabbing the ghost girl. A closer look showed they were the many women she had possessed of the years; Angela and Burns clenched her throat and hair respectively. All their eyes were glowing with purple energy as they wore angry expressions"Ack! NO! How are they even-?!""How are they still 'alive' so to speak? You may have devoured their spirit energy until they were nothing but their memories live on through you. I've given a bit of my power to those memories. As you can see, they all remember you quite well and are eager to get even with you and have you experience every bit of pain they ever endured. They'll have time. Believe me, you and every single one them will have all the time in the world. Time does move much slower here.", Mirabelle coldly explains as Heather screams and thrashes tryinh to break free only for them to pull her in. She holds onto the edge of the space as the hand grab at her hair and face and seeing Mirabelle's indifferent expression."HAHAHA YOU THINK YOU WON?! MY FRIENDS ARE STILL COMING FOR YOU AND YOUR HUBBY! IF THEY CATCH YOU YOU'RE FAMILY IS GOOD AS DEAD!", Heather shouted at her.Mirabelle step up to her getting up to her face, "If.", she spoke as Heather's eyes widen."It's an interesting thought...but that's all it is and all you are now. So...begone thought.", Mirabelle finished striking the end of her scythe to the ground."NOOOOO!", Heather screams as the window closes on her then forms into a three-dimensional glowing purple cube that fall to the floor.Mirabelle picks it up looking at it before sending it levitating upward going deep, deep into her subconscious. She then slices an opening in space and steps through arriving back in Caleb's subconscious. He still lay on the ground in practically the same condition as she left him before quickly rushing to his aid. She touches his chest and purple stream of aura flows into him sending ripples throughout his form as the yellow veiny mark start vanishing from his face and body....Real world...Drei approached Caleb's unconcious body about to administer another dose of serum before noticing, to her shock, the marks on his arm and face were slowly receding as his skin returned to normal.Before she could fully process what she was seeing, Mirabelle teleports inside the panic room."Dear!", she stated going up to and kneeling beside him."What are YOU doing down here?! Get away from him! It's not...safe", Drei stated before noticing the marks on Caleb's body were receding as his skin returned to normal.His eyes flutter open, vision clearing up to see Mirabelle smiling over with tears in her eyes."Hey, Moon pie...", Caleb spoke with a thankful smile forming."Hello, Dear.", Mirabelle spoke sweetly.Caleb slowly reaches up caressing her face and wiping her tears with his thumb as she held his hand in place nuzzling his palm. She then throws herself at him in strong hug as her breasts mush into his chest as she wept."Mmph! Easy Moon pie, I'm still sore all over.", Caleb grunted rubbing her back trying to calm her."I-I *sniffle* I'm sorry. I thought I lost you! I was so scared!", Mirabelle whimpered.Caleb doesn't reply just pets the top of her head to console. She earned these tears from what they just went through.Drei stares in disbelief before quickly taking out her phone pressing speed dial, "Zwei, get everyone down here now! He's OK!"She hangs up and approaches him, "How do you feel?""Ok.", Caleb replies before finally notices his surroundings then sees Drei in her little yellow HAZMAT suit, "Why are we in the panic room and what the hell are you wearing?""Answer to both, protection.", Drei spoke apparently."Ah. No further questions.", Caleb replied.A couple minutes later the entrance to the panic room and others hastily come running in with Lyca and Camilla pushing first."SENOR!", CHIEF!", The two of them exclaims before stopping in their tracks upon seeing him sitting up on the couch with Mirabelle, have calmed down a bit, supporting him.Caleb looks at them feeling a it ashamed, "Hey...girls.Camilla and Lyca were both uncertain and hesitant to approach him"S-Senor...?", Camilla spoke keeping her distance out of caution and fear."Chief? H-How do feel?", Lyca asks softly like a scared child that upset a parent.Ein and Zwei were also apprehensive about getting to close to him."I'm...alright. I know word probably doesn't mean shit right now but...please believe me. I'm so sorry...to all of you.", Caleb spoke his voice cracking, "I won't ask for forgiveness but I promise you I'm ok."Camilla and Lyca pause sensing the sincerity and shame in his voice. Deep in their hearts, they knew he was telling the truth. Ein and Zwei could also feel it.Not hesitating anymore, Lyca and Camilla run to him and tackling their lover into a heartfelt embrace knocking the wind out of him."Chief! You're ok! Chief's ok! I was so scared you were gonna diieeee!", Lyca cries into his shirt hugging his waist tight nuzzling his stomach. Caleb winces as gagging a bit as she squeezed his mid-section."Me too!", Camilla stated pulling Caleb into her hugging him tight smothering his face in her cleavage, "I could not BARE to live in this world without ju, mi Amor! Ju are my EVERYTHING! I love you! I do not care what ju said or done! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!", the Elder Devil wept profusely holding him tightly afraid to let go making it harder to breath."I love you too, Chief! I love you!", Lyca stated tightening her grip."Um, I get you guys love him and all but maybe give the man some breathing room?", Drei says catching their attention. The two girls release him."HAAAA haaaa *inhales* haaaaaaa", Caleb gasps folding his stomach and taking deep breaths."Los sientos, Señor!", Camilla apologized in worried tone."Sorry! Sorry Chief! Did I hurt you?", Lyca asks in fear.Caleb coughs at bit before lowly chuckling to the others surprise and slight worry."Haaa...I guess it's true...love sho'nough hurts.", Caleb says in a joking tone. This earns a small grin from Mirabelle and the others, "I love you girls too."Caleb and the girls embrace in one big group hug on the couch as the Zyklons watch them enjoying the moment."We're so happy you're doing much better, sir.", Ein spoke in a caring tone."Yeah, you really scared us there for a moment. You sure showed that nasty parasite who's the Boss!", Zwei congratulated giving a thumbs up.Realization suddenly hit Caleb and Mirabelle as they stop embracing to Lyca and Camilla confusion."It..It wasn't a parasite guys.", Caleb informs as the others look to him curiously."What do you mean?", Drei inquires."It was something...or, more accurately, someONE else controlling Dear.", Mirabelle jumps in clenching the couch cushion. The others look to her in surprise."SomeONE? Like...someone was manipulating him? Are they still nearby?!", Ein inquires listening prepared to take action"Yes..but actually no", Mirabelle answers garnishing more confusion, "There's...alot we need to tell you all."Caleb sits up on his own feet to the floor and elbows to his knees with a ponderous expression before addressing the circumstances."This isn't over yet guy.", Caleb relays with a sigh as they all look him, "It's just getting started."..............WRSUP FAM!
