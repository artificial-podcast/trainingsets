    “So, how are Yokai made?” Virto asked Vargas. They were walking on the ocean together, enjoying the sunset that came down on the horizon to the beyond. Vargas more of floated right above the waterline, while Virto had nanites on his soles that gripped the water like a stick bug. “I understand how you were made, but, I’m curious about what happens in general.”“I don’t have much of an answer that would fully help. You would have to ask my mother about this,” Vargas answered back.“Is it because your mother is lowering the sun?” Virto asked, looking around them for anything besides the flat plane of water below. “Is she close around?”“She is always around, shining down on us with comforting rays of light,” Vargas said, waving to the setting sun. “At least mentally. I heard it can be tiring being all over the place physically if she does it for too long.”“She does get a lot of massages…”“Magic hands go a long way, but back to your question...do you mind supernatural answers?”“It’s a different world,” Virto said, shrugging indifferently. “I can accept a world that works differently.”“If you say so. There are multiple ways of Yokai appearing. An object could be cursed or spited, and gain sentience through gathering natural energy and obtaining a purpose. That is the most common way I know. Then can be born from Yokai, be it by using their energy to create a new yokai or a more crude and lewd method…”“That doesn’t sound too bad. The natural ways of nature doing...nature things.” Virto said uncertainly. gets head patted by the kitsune, pulled in closer against his side. “Of course. We did a bit of Yokai creation ourselves, you know.”“But if I'm a human, and you're a yokai, Isn’t that a one in four chance of being yokai-ish?”[Quick note, anyone curious about the chart --> Hh + YY = HH (Hh), HY, Hh, and hY]“Maybe, and we can always try one sometime.” He winks down at Virto, Virto winking back up at him. “Although, there is another way humans or mamono can gain the status of a Yokai.” Virto looked up curiously. “What is it?”“I’m not sure exactly how it works, but all that is needed is a vessel and the soul of a yokai. I know the one being inducted today experienced it…” as soon as he talked about the new Yokai, both their eyes opened in a sudden, oncoming panic. “The induction!” They both yelled. Vargas scooped up Virto in his arms and started running in the opposite direction. He left splashes of water with each step, rushing to get off the ocean and to the meeting. “I can’t believe I forgot!” Vargas exclaimed. “Damn me and my focus on your beauty!”“Maybe if we both run we can get there faster,” Virto said, wrapping her arms around Vargas’ neck to keep still. “No, you could have a yokai inside you, just hold on tight,” he assured, reaching in view of the beach. He let her down after his feet touched the sand, turning around to show her his tails. “Why couldn’t I just go in the portal before?” Virto asked, starting to question if they just ran across the water for no reason.“Because, I wouldn’t be ready to teleport right after!” He said innocently. Virto took a second before diving into the tails, disappearing head-first into the mass of floof. Sparing details, he appeared in a large bin of wool, a yokai peddler bringing her head to him. “Virto?” Vargas said, coming into the store a moment later. He waved from the large container of wool, holding his hands up so his husband can pull him free of the soft trap. Vargas did a polite bow to the peddler and locked hands with Virto, taking her outside. They walked into a busy street, full of various mamono, male and female, wearing a rainbow of kimonos. The majority of them seemed to be filing into a large temple, a three-story wonder of bamboo and stone. “Is that it?” Virto asked.“The one and only meeting grounds. Come, Ganan is probably already inside,” Vargas said. The two of them followed the crowd, weaving around people to speed up the trip. They went through open doors, seeing the center a few flights of stairs down. Terraces of stone flowed down with the stairs until they reached the lowest point in the center. Down there, was the fire mouse from earlier, holding a fist over her mouth and pacing in a small circle. With her was a glasses-wearing lady with white and green hair, loose-fitting clothing, and a royal green felt hat. She had two medium-sized horns that protruded outward from her head. Her legs were like a goat’s if a goat was bipedal. Beside the green-wearing Hakutaku was an Owl mage. Brown feathers stacked on feathers concealed her every look and bountiful body, making her look more like a circle with a head and talons. Her arm-wings were folded at her side, as she stood as still as a statue.“Should we go down?” Virto asked, staring at the Owl Mage. Her pupils shifted and caught Virto’s gaze, staring into her eyes until Virto looked away out of intimidation. “We could, but we should say hello after the meeting. For now, let's sit on one of the seats.” The two took a spot halfway down to the central stage, sitting down in a space that looked just big enough for an Inari and a Human. Until then, there was a bit more waiting for the meeting to start. Virto kept staring down, feeling her hubby’s head fall past her vision into her lap. “Boredom dear?”“I guess we did come a bit early.” Virto nodded and gave him a kiss on his ear, watching it twitch around after the peck. “I’ll wake you up when it starts.” Vargas nodded and closed his eyes, soon falling asleep while Virto hand-brushed his hair.“That is a pleasant fox,” someone said beside him. It was a woman with yellow pupils and small bi-forked horns pointing up and back. A large bout of white hair flowed behind her shoulder. Two fins replaced her ears, and she wore a golden kimono that only came halfway up her bosom. Her human torso transformed into a long golden dragon tail somewhere under her clothing, the tail being tucked haphazardly under where she sat. “And I see you’re the lucky human. Never thought I would see a human in a place like this.”“Things happen when you get into a relationship with a yokai,” Virto casually answered. His hands continued giving tender apprehension to Vargas’ face, moving to lightly scratch at his cheek next.“I understand that. You obtain access to areas and power you wouldn’t have otherwise,” the golden Ryu answered back. “Yet, you haven’t seemed to have been turned into a mamono yet.”“Nanowatch,” Virto said, pulling on the sleeve of his lab coat to show a sleek, blue watch adorning his wrist.“N-nano?” The Ryu asked, unfamiliar with the concept.“It is a thing I could explain, but I don’t think we will meet again,” Virto explained. She softly smiled and nodded. “I wouldn’t have understood it anyway, there are just so many new things that I need to prepare for…” she said wistfully, staring up to the natural light seeping in through the roof. She looked back at Virto, placing a hand on Vargas’ forehead. “I can feel his purring through his head-”“It feels wholesome,” Virto responded back.“I can get accustomed to this. If we do meet again, can I ask for what I may call you?”“Virto.”“The pleasure is mine Virto. My name is…” an instrument chimed before she could say. Virto looked around, seeing the doors closed and the place suddenly full of Yokai all zeroed onto the center. Virto quickly tapped Vargas’ shoulder, his eyes opening as he looked onward from his lap pillow with folded arms.“Attention, my associates,” the Hakutaku said with a booming voice. “I am pleased that so many were able to attend on short notice. This is an important day, after all. As the second to lord Amaterasu, it is my duty to inform the Association, that Ganan will be leading the next few meetings instead of our Lord.” Ganan stood up and bowed, with a furrowed brow and a slight frown. Murmurs passed among the crowd, asking where the god of the sun was. “It is a temporary change I assure you. A test for her disciple to see if she could handle matters. Ganan?”“Thank you for the introduction,” the Hinezumi said. She stepped forward, taking center stage. “As you all know, I am the underling to lord Amaterasu, and deity of the summer. I will like to start by thanking my mentor for this opportunity, and I have made an oath to not let her down.”“With the formalities past, our next business matter is on the fate of the Council. With the sun yokai potentially leaving the foremost position, the Council members have made the decision to allow a new deity to possibly take the mantle. This position can only apply to Association members, and you must be vetted by Nabu before you may be admitted.”“Next, we have new blood among our ranks. May our new deity of the harvest show herself?” The Ryu beside Virto stood up, giving a small wave goodbye to him before making her way to the steps and down. She slowly went down, but tripped up and fell down the last flight, landing in a mess of tail on the center stage.“Sorry!” she said, picking herself up and rushing to regain her regal stature. “I, I have not gotten used to my tail just yet…”“Hurry up Mizuki,” Ganan said without a change in her serious expression.“With fevor!” She moved in front of the mouse, brushing her hair down and aside before standing in front of her. Ganan nodded and turned her around to face the crowd. “This, is our new yokai! Chosen by a spirit of nature, she has been prepared in recent time to perform.” Mizuki stared at everyone, unable to think of anything else but how much Ganan’s arm burned on her shoulder. “I want you all to make her feel welcome, or at the very least, not be a bother. A few territories were revised, so please see the scroll of the map for an update to what lands you shall inherit.”“Inherit?” Virto asked his husband while Ganan continued her speech. “I thought you just watched over nature…”“We did, until constant conflicts between humans were initiated among yokai that couldn’t decide who’s land was who’s,” Vargas said. “Mother didn’t sleep for some nights…”“Wait, are you saying that this is…”“Mmhmm. The Yokai Association is one large…”“Alliance, if you needed a reminder,” Ganan said as she happened to finish Vargas’s explanation. “Remember, this group was created to prevent conflict, not sanction it. Anyone caught in any hostile altercation will be personally dealt with.”“Ganan,” Nabu said sternly.“Sorry Nabu. I clarify, you will be punished by the council accordingly…” Ganan cleared her throat. “Now, the last piece of news is important. We have received complaints about the new technologies that have begun to crop up. We believe they are seemly connected to the purple haze from several months ago, but we haven’t located the yokai who had caused it,” Ganan explained. “We are confident that no matter how advance the humans become, we shall always be needed and worshiped. However, Lord Amaterasu has stated that….we are admittedly old-fashioned….” Murmurs among the audience cropped up but were stamped out when Nabu tapped her foot against the ground. “As I was saying, we do not control humans, merely the environment that they reside in. Nature shall always win in the end, but to not fall by the wayside of worship, I have been told to warn of “adjustments” made. I personally think the human’s water wheels should go to hell, but I respect my superior’s position, and we all shall as well.” There were more grumbles among the crowd, but no one seemed willing to challenge the sun god’s decree.“With this, Welcome to the Yokai Association Mizuki, and everyone is officially dismissed.” Virto and Vargas looked around as everyone started leaving the premises, going to gather outside or head back to their homes. “So that is the other way,” Virto said, Vargas sitting up with a yawn beside her. “Of course! Anyone can be selected by a yokai's soul to become its new vessel. Mizuki, if that seems to be the name, is not the first, and she won’t be the last,” Vargas said.“How in the world do you find a yokai soul?” Virto said. “Certainly they don’t just seek out people, right?”“Maybe they do, but I have yet to see one with my own eyes…” Vargas said, watching the Ryu talk to Ganan and Nabu. “Who really cares about how she became a yokai though. She seems nice!” Vargas said, going down to greet the new inductee properly. Virto cared, of course. She had several questions that her scientific brain needed settling. However, seeing Vargas care-freely strike up a conversation, she sighed and just followed in his example. Her origin is probably just standard yokai things, Virto said to herself.
  
    Chapter Text
    A young, bright-minded girl woke up from her bed a week ago, skipping to the window and taking a breath of the fresh summer air. Her hair got blown by the wind carrying itself into her window, flowing around the few objects that can be moved. “I love this time!” She exclaimed, walking out and embracing the wind like an old friend. It was this time of year she always waited for, through the snow and through the flowers. Through the heat, and through the downpour that sprints through. All for watching the fruits of plant growth finally coming to reality, as seeds turn to various foods to pluck from the stems and ground.She skipped away from her home, her feet landing on cool dirt while she traveled down to the village orchard. “Hello, Anna!” She yelled to the quiet how she passed. The curtains parted just enough for two green eyes to glare at her. “Are you ready for another great harvest season?” asked Anna. Seemingly grumpy, Anna closed back the blinds, retreating inside without even joining her in her barefoot adventure. She shrugged it off though, continuing on her trip towards the Orchard. Possibly a blooming flower could be waiting for her!She came across a caravan, heading with bushels of hay and livestock to her village. She waved at them as they passed, but each of the horse directors was focused on keeping the horses in line. “If only they had something that could push itself, so they would say hi,” she said to herself, seeing a yellow orb drop from one of the backs. “Wait!” she yelled, picking up the orb. Aside from a bit of dirt, it seemed perfectly fine, and pulsed in her hand. “This looks like one of those fortune balls that tellers use,” she assumed, staring into it to see if she could see her future. Of course, most balls were for tricks, so she had no such luck. She silently swore and started running after the horses. Since they were trading, they stopped near the fields, talking to others while some started to let the livestock off and unload hay. She sneakily tucked the orb back into one of the caravans and went along with her day.She was back on schedule to see the flowers! And this time, no weird magical orb stopped her. Her dress found itself grazing along elbow-high blades of wheat. She sat under various trees, staring up at the apples that were just starting to grow and ripen. She stepped on stray leaves from various potato plants. She sat in front of the grape bushes, just watching as if they were her children on a playground. No local that walked by thought it was out of the ordinary. The girl did this each year, dedicating entire days to checking the progress of everything grown. Some even talked about her as an omen; that if she stopped visiting the plants, not enough things will be ripe and ready for plucking come fall.It is a superstition, but so far, nothing had happened to prove the notion wrong. She watched and explored until she had grown tired, and went back to her home to freshen up. When she came back to her door, she found that same orb at her doorstep, pulsing all the same as before. “That’s strange, I thought I gave it back,” she said, picking it up once again. The yellow orb pulsed harder, almost visibly vibrating in her palm. She stepped outside and went to the nearest tree, setting it down and hurrying back inside her room. She entered her bathing room. She stopped cold, seeing the glowing yellow orb sitting on the ground before her. She got worried, picking up the orb and quickly throwing it out of the window. “Stay there!” she said. The orb, still pulsing, rolled back to the window she threw it from, and up the wall back into the house. She picked it up and ran out of her house, near screaming the entire way.“Anna!” she said, sliding to a stop in front of the shut-in’s house. An irritated “What!?” came from Anna.“I need your help!” she said. The door opened a bit later, showing a white-hair and short girl looking up at the orb-holder. If the first lady’s hair was unkempt, Anna’s looked like a hurricane had blown through her room. Her jade eyes gave an annoyed look. “It is too early for any nonsense Mizuki,” she said.“But Anna, look!” Mizuki showed her the orb. “It’s some sort of glowing ball!”“It could be a crystal ball, and a fancy one at that…” Anna said, making an attempt to take it out of her hand. However, it stuck to Mizuki like glue, pulling her with the orb into Anna. “Ouch!” she said. “Stop that, it hurts my hand!”“Is the devil’s glue on this thing?” Anna said, letting go of the orb. Mizuki shook the orb-holding hand, holding it while the pain went back down. Anna put a hand on her back as an apology. “Sorry, but why is the orb sticking to you so much?” she said.“I don’t know!” Mizuki whined. “It just wouldn’t leave my hand no matter what!” She tried pulling herself, only to watch it pop cleanly off of her palm. Anna looked stunned, trying to pull it from its new perch on her new hand. Mizuki started yelling in pain once more and Anna relented, giving her a moment to wait out the stings. “It seems to only like you,” Anna said. “Where did you even find this?”“It dropped off a wagon,” Mizuki recalled. “I wanted to give it back, but-”“WHY WOULD YOU PICK THAT UP?” Anna said not calmly. “You’re cursed now, that’s what it is. ”“I wanted to return it, honest. Is it really that bad to want to do something nice?”“I guess not.” Anna folded her arms and sat down on a seat. “But now you are cursed because of it. Idiot.”“Maybe it is a good curse. It will give me the ability to talk to nature!”“Or corrupt you and make you destroy our village.” Anna went to the kitchen, coming back with a bowl full of water. “We can try heating this up with a fire, then pour it on your hand…”“But I can take it off!” Not wanting to burn her hand on boiling water, waved her hand rapidly through the air. With her palm outstretched, she thought she could jolt the orb off of her. However, even with its small perch on her hand, it stayed firm and didn’t shake off. “It just...takes...a bit of effort…”“Mizuki.”“We just need more hands to shake it!”“Mizuki….”“Please! Maybe um, um….” Anna put her hands on Mizuki’s cheeks, shushing her up. “We’re trying the water thing, this isn’t going to work.” Defeated, Mizuki nodded, not looking forward to heating up water at all. Anna took the metal bowl outside, getting someone to start a fire while Mizuki waited inside. “Why can’t you just come off?” She said to the pulsing orb. “I don’t want to burn my hand, but now you won’t leave my arm….sigh, not like you’ll listen anyways…”“It is imperative that you don’t separate us!” Went a voice in her head. Mizuki’s head darted around, looking for someone that could be hiding behind a wall or furniture. “W-what?”“You are the successor I was looking for,” the voice said again. “This orb is the only way we can communicate. It took a while to fully bond to your spirit….”“But who are you?” Mizuki whispered, opening the door to check for Anna. She was nowhere in view, meaning she had time before her hands will be tortured in hot water. “I’m flattered you would ask. I am a yokai spirit; one that has looked over your domain for centuries. I control the winds and the soil, the rain, and the fires, all that lets your crops bloom when the leaves turn golden…”“It always did feel a bit superstitious…”“Indeed. However, like all things on this land, I am not permanent. My power has been waning Mizuki…I need a new vessel to take on my powers, a new yokai to perform my duties.”“But aren’t you a spirit?”“Spirits may seem immortal, but not invincible. I was created by this world, and the world has urged me to move on.” The glowing orb started to roll up Mizuki’s arm. “Aii!” Mizuki said, caught off guard by the tickling on her wrist. The orb seemed undisturbed, slowly going on top of her head to sit. “Come now, I must train you before it’s too late.”“W-what? But I can’t leave now. I need to tell Anna!”“You can inform her after you have finished, but we must go now. I sense a presence approaching, and a mass of boiling water approaching.”“That is Anna..oh no, she’s gonna try to separate us!” Mizuki started pacing around, looking for an escape route. “Maybe the window….”“That seems to be the best choice right now, but just to ensure.” The golden orb sunk into her head without warning, making her woozy while it seeped into the insides of her body. Her nerves, her blood vessels, and the very fabric of her body were taken by the voice. Her eyes rolled into the back of her head, replaced by two golden silts for eyes. “Now there is nothing stopping us,” the voice said authoritively, taking her captive’s body and diving through a closed window. The glass shattered to the floor as she broke her landing with her arms, picked herself up, and ran away.Anna opened the door soon after, escorted by a gruff man holding the hot water. “Alright Mizuki, I realized that if we did it quickly, we could…Mizuki?”The spirit-possessed gal ran into a dense forest, her feet crinkling the leaves that were the first to fall from their trees. She ran at full speed the entire time, defying the limits of her body until she reached a yard tucked into the forest. Her feet touched cobblestone as she walked into the area, surrounded by dozens of stone statues made in the yokai’s honor. Each one was a different symbol, etched out by what appeared to be a master of sculpting. Weeds and flowers grew within the cracks of the yard, showing their age.Once her eyes rolled back to normal, her body collapsed onto the stone ground. It was no longer powered by the yokai and desperately needed oxygen and rest. Mizuki couldn’t even talk, too busy with her lungs begging for new air to replenish her body. Any attempt came out in gasps, no matter if she was breathing in or out.“In this shape after such a small run? Rushing the matter turned out to be the right choice,” the voice said again. The orb was no longer on her, but the yokai had already intertwined their spirits. At least physically. “We will need a lot more training before you can fully contain my power.”After an extended break, Mizuki was guided inside what was supposed to be her new abode. She didn’t even know how to get back to the village, but it was so buried within forest that it wouldn’t even matter. Anyone who couldn’t spot a path will be hopelessly lost. She stepped past two decaying statues of dragons, the moss covering their heads and the tails that winded back and forth like a whip. Past them, it did not get much better. The entire home was flat Minka, with the flooring being wood and torn jute rugs. The only two rooms that weren’t completely destroyed were the kitchen and her sleeping quarters. The kitchen was only barely recognizable by the coals in the central fireplace, which was more of a bowl with burnable material surrounded by a square cutoff. A pot hung from the roof, swaying gently as its support looked ready to collapse entirely.The bedroom wasn’t in better shape. What tipped her off was the comforters haphazardly on the floor. Other than that, it might as well have been a bathroom. “W-what is that smell?” Mizuki said.“Deer dung,” the voice said matter-of-factly. “Once I lost my physical form, I was unable to keep my quarters clean. It was...too much to use this home anymore.”“Ewwwwwww...”“Nothing to be worried about. Once you have taken the mantle, this shrine can get back to its former glory!” The next stop was down the steps. They were originally hidden under flooring as a secret entrance, but years of decay had unveiled it to any animal that felt like going down. It led to a small room that lit up on its own, illuminating dozens, maybe hundreds of scrolls by candlelight. “This is the most sacred part of the home. Frankly, I am amazed it is still this intact,” the voice admitted. “My predecessors have contributed their own records of spells and events. I have added my share of notes, and now you will have the chance to forge your own part of this room.”“It looks so full already…” Mizuki said.“It will grow as it accumulates knowledge. Besides, making space for scrolls is not the most pressing matter right now…” Mizuki moved on to the last part of the land, the garden. It was a rock garden in actuality but one that was in terrible shape. Natural events had shifted the rocks all around and had even caused some to overflow their limits into the grass. Any relaxing things out here had been utterly destroyed.The only thing that wasn’t broken was the view. As she stepped out, she saw the forest side fall down, trees standing upright in the sloping hill. The gaps left the sun to shine its brilliance through, making shadows that hit her and the home as it descended further west. It almost made her forget about the fact of poop being in the house. Almost.“The light of Amaterasu blesses this land. It is the only reason it has a shred of respectable look left,” the yokai said. “Mizuki, please heed my words. If I fade to become one with the lands, I will not fight it. But I just can’t leave my home...like this. It is horrid.”“I understand...but what can I do? I’m just some villager.”“One that respects the seasons more than some of my peers. I see more than just a pretty girl. I see potential...I would place my hand on your heart if I had a physical form.” Mizuki giggled and placed her hand on her chest. “Thank you. Now then, it will be one of the hardest trials of your life, you will endure many things that will make you want to end your existence right there. If you accept, there is no going back.” Mizuki looked out towards the sun as if it had the right answer for her. It was silent, but she knew what she had to do. “It would be a shame if this place went to waste,” she said. “I’ll do it.”“Good! I mean, nicely chosen.” The yokai corrected her voice, trying to hide her thankfulness. “Now then, before we can train, we must first clean up this place.”“Well, you help me with your power?” She heard the spirit chuckle quietly. “No, but I can be here to give sound advice, and constant support.”“That doesn’t help at all.”“Sure it does! For example, there is a bundle of corn husk I use to sweep debris….”
  
    Chapter Text
    Anna woke up the next morning to peace and quiet. She got ample amounts of sleep and was able to keep others from seeing her until she was all dolled up to do her duties in the village. While she felt nice with a full night’s rest, something was still off. She wasn’t being bugged at all, and her house didn’t smell like barley. A certain crop-lover was missing, and it was driving her crazy.She wasn’t too crazy about waiting for her to come back. After seeing her missing in her home, she decided to wait until Mizuki came back, sad and with that orb still stuck to her. Probably corrupted, but it would be nice to see her knocked down a peg.At least that’s what she told herself. The layer of vindication and spite wore down as the sun went away then back. Eventually, she was just worried, feeling a hole left in her day without Mizuki coming to bug her about how ripe each apple is turning out… “Maybe I should arrange a search party,” she said, straightening out her hair.While Anna started gathering people around to find her, Mizuki had woken up in the stone yard. She bowed to the statue she sat in front of, heading inside to get that broom. The spirit told her that today would be the hardest, as they will have to refurbish the land before her training could officially begin. It started with enduring the terrible smells to clean out the dung, getting rid of anything and everything that smelled, followed by a quick sprint to a nearby river. “Nice, now throw out that comforter!” She said, Mizuki rushing back with her nose pinched. The more she moved around, the more intense the stench got, as she was digging more and more from behind rubble. After two grueling hours, she had cleared the bedroom, tossing everything into a growing pile to the side of the yokai’s house.She did the same for the garden, then the kitchen, then the rest of the rooms. Only one short break was allowed by the yokai, which was spent in the dim light of the basement. Eventually, the home went from absolute terrible, to only being terrible and empty (Progress!). Mizuki fell onto the stone once the last debris was added to the pile, completely spent. Her dress had armpit stains from the labor, and her brow dripped sweat, even in the autumn chill. The wind blew over her body, summoned by the yokai to help cool her hard worker. “Wonderful!” The Yokai said. “It’s only midday, and we have already made so much progress.”“I-” Mizuki’s stomach rumbled before she could respond. “Tired…”“Didn’t you eat before we arrived here?”“I haven’t eaten since two days ago...wait I haven’t eaten in two days?” Mizuki said astonished at herself. She had been so distracted by the yokai and the cleaning that she hadn’t put anything in her stomach. She sat up, her stomach rumbling becoming unbearable to ignore. “I-I need to go back home….”“But what about your training?”“I can’t train if I’m dying from hunger…” She hunched over from another rumble before starting to make her way away from the yokai’s home.“Stop it, you don’t know the way back! You will be lost! We can just as easily catch fish at the river, if you are this starved.” Mizuki stopped and leaned against a nearby tree, feeling her footing being lost the longer she walked. “I can’t….it’s too far...”“Then I’ll get you there. This might tingle…” The spirit said as it took over her body again. Mizuki collapsed onto the ground while she took a backseat, her eyes rolling back to let golden ones take her place. The limp body roused itself up again, and started running over to the river. ‘This felt slower than before,’ the yokai spirit thought as she shot down the hill. She didn’t stop when she arrived at the river, diving with momentum into the moving water. She reemerged with a live fish in her mouth, spitting it out on the ground before diving back in for more….Anna waited patiently in her home, tapping her lap while others passed outside. The search party she sent hasn’t come back, and it was eating away at her core. She had already turned Mizuki’s home upside down and had searched crops next. Those were the only two places she knew she would go, but not a hair was out of sight around the farm. She couldn’t be that scared of a scald, right?Her tapping got more anxious as she peeked out of the window once more. The sun was beginning its descent down all too fast for her. It felt like it was noon, but there it was, starting to dip its bottom below the treeline in the distance. None of the people around resembled the bright and blunt lass that would annoy Anna at the window or door each morning. “Oh Mizuki, this is getting ridiculous…”The missing girl woke up on the cold flooring of the kitchen, light shining through the numerous holes in the ceiling and walls. She rubbed her eyes and yawned, swearing that she had just passed out on the forest ground just a few hours ago…The cramps came back to bite, keeping her on the ground as she clutched her stomach. For once though, a delicious smell pierced through the pain, waffling up through her nose. She searched around the room for it, spying the center of the kitchen lit with dim embers. The pot had been snapped off its roof, but it sat at the heat, cooking away whatever was inside.The cramps lessened in intensity, replaced by a yearning for the smell. She stumbled upward and went to the pot, lifting the lid to peek at what was inside. It was hard to see, but she could make out the outline of a fish, cooking away against the metal. “You’re finally awake,” the yokai said. “I keep forgetting how tiresome a human vessel can get…”“Y-you caught fish?” Mizuki said. “But home…”“No. There is no need to go home Mizuki!” The spirit sternly told her. “It is imperative that you do not, and if you won’t understand, I can always keep this body, forever.”“You, you can’t do that…” Mizuki’s hand suddenly came up towards her, pressing her lips closed. She frantically tried to remove her hand, but her fingers were tight like glue. “I can do what I wish, dear. You, however, can’t even pry your own hand open.”“Mmmm!” Mizuki struggled more. She fought against the grip, but whatever strength the spirit had taken for her hand couldn’t be replicated with another. She tossed and turned on her feet, putting her hand down into her elbow to try to push the arm away. Not even the last-ditch effort could work the fingers of her lips; only cause her pain when her lips were pulled with them. “Mmmm….” she whined, falling to her knees as tears welled up in her eyes.“I didn’t wish to punish you either, but I can’t let this happen again…not in this moment.” She could feel the disappointment coming off the spirit, leaking into her own emotions as well.  “You are destined Mizuki, don’t you see? You must be prepared, trained, but retreating to your lands is not part of this training.” Her hand’s grip softened, letting her finally pull them off her mouth. A red spot was left by her fingers, circling around her mouth and stinging away. “Yes, spirit…” Mizuki said sadly. She took the fish out, making sure to scrape an edge off by a stick, so she could pick it up without burning her hand. She carried the hot finish out to the rock garden to eat, watching the sun and nature pass around her. Her hunger got sated, but now, she was missing the presence of another person…Mizuki woke up early that morning, using her clothes to sleep on the stone. Another reason to love fall, she guessed. It wasn’t too cold to sleep naked in the wilderness. She could hear the snoozing of the spirit in her head while she dressed. She went to the side of the yard, deciding that it was finally time to figure out what to do with the pile of rubble. Mysteriously though, it was gone. It didn’t register at her first, thinking she had somehow misplaced the mess somewhere else. She went to another part of the yard, but didn’t see anything there either. It took another trip back before she had realized what happened, looking around the Minka for anyone that could have passed through here.“Spirit,” she whispered, carefully peaking into the rooms. “Spirit!”It was no use. For once, she was in sole possession, while soft breathing sounded from her ear canals. They weren’t dropped back into the rooms either or spread about down the hill. It was just gone!Not that it was a bad thing. Unable to find a reason for the disappearance, she went back to the first location. Fully awake now, she went into the kitchen, picking up the pot to take with her to the river. As she had literally no idea how to fix up a house, it was time to do the next best thing; wash the statues. With a potful of water and trees full of leaves to use as crude sponges, she started wiping the moss and other stains off of one of the statues. It was tiring to be able to cover so little at a time, but she made her way up around the first symbol. “There,” she said, dropping the leave and moving back to admire her work in the rising sun. Compared to the other, time-tested stone, the washed statue had a fresh look that was worthy of being in the light of Amaterasu. Without warning, the statue flashed golden, its flash washing over the surrounding stone and leaving it clean and gleaming. Mizuki jumped back out of it, narrowing avoiding the circle of gold, tripping over her pot of water and falling onto the ground.“Oh my….” She looked at the circle of pure grey-blue stone, perfectly surrounding the clean statue. It stuck out like a sore thumb against the still dirty ground, but…Mizuki looked at the pot of water and the fallen leaf, an idea coming to mind. She moved on to another next statue. She anxiously waited for the next statue to glow while wiping the bird poop and moss off, jumping away at random moments when she thought it will shoot out the golden circle. Her timing wasn’t good enough, as at a whip at the top, the circle came out. She was standing on her tippy-toes when it happened, leaving her vulnerable as the golden wiped up her body like a light gleam over wax. It lasted only an instant but left a hazy feeling over her skin. She didn’t just feel cleaned, she felt refreshed and reset. It made her laugh by chance; she covered her mouth, listening to the quiet snooze to check if the spirit had been stirred.Assured she wasn’t, she moved on to the other statues in the garden. The home may still be in shambles, and the garden was still a mess of rocks, but the yard was going to look like an entire crew came to do a professional shine. Plus, it made her giddy when she got cleaned, over and over.She heard a yawn while polishing the dragon statues in front of the door. “Time to wake up little Mizuki,” the spirit said. “Oh, Mizuki, you are….”“I slept a bit early spirit,” she said. “I was homesick, but I thought about it, and I think you were right. I still miss home, but once I become a yokai, I can help it so much!”“Mizuki...you…” her eyes switched to gold for the moment, as the spirit wanted a look around. She turned a few turns, looking at all the symbols. They looked just as nice as they did when they were first made. “Do you like it?” Mizuki said once she was given control back. “I think the yokai magic cleaned the floor along with it.”“Do the dragons,” the spirit said urgently. “Hurry! We are so close!”“O-okay!” Mizuki wiped off the last bit of grime on the dragon and quickly leaf-polished off the last one. She stood back as they started pulsing. “The statues didn’t do that spirit…”“Yes! I knew you were the right choice! I would pat you but…” Mizuki patted herself for the spirit, while her eyes were glued onto the glow. It washed over the house repeatedly, slowly enveloping the entire area in waves of golden semicircles. It was mesmerizing but quickly got too bright for her to bear. Mizuki put her hand in front of her eyes, waiting until the glare came down to see what had happened.Her home had completely restored itself once the gold had faded away, with everything intact and full of blooming color. Shocked, she went to the backyard to check on the rock garden, seeing a reclining chair, wind chimes, a rake nicely leaned against the wall, and the rocks raked into a nice soothing circle.“What happened?” Mizuki said, about to step on the garden when the spirit stopped her. “Wait! Let us go in through the front. The restoration only happens once, after all.”“So I brought back the power of the home?” Mizuki asked as she walked through the clean halls. “In simple term’s yes. I found it a pain to cover the cleansing of all the land, so I parted with some of my energy and infused it in the stone itself. When my power started waning, it must have faded enough to get trapped under a layer of dirt itself.” While the spirit explained it, Mizuki did a double check of the kitchen. The pot was back to being hung from the ceiling, with the fire under it alive and well. A variety of foods were spread around the edge, with enough stockpiled to last maybe a year. “Oh my!”“The fishing was just a temporary issue if you were curious. But I must know, how did you know that cleaning the statues will bring back the temple?”“The statues just looked dirty, and when I saw the circles….”“Oh yes, they are quite perfect aren’t they?” She cut off. “Yes, yes, yes, with this, we can finally begin your training!”“I’m going to become a yokai now?”“No. Your body is still too mortal. But, we can start off small.”
  
    Chapter Text
    It was now day five since Mizuki had disappeared. Anna had gotten excited by the search party's return, but their search had turned up the same answer everyone else had given her. Nothing.The leader was met with the slap of a slipper, sent a step back as Anna winded up to threaten another. "Lies! You did not look hard enough! All of you!""Lass, we have tried," he assured her, surrounded by his men. "Stand down my friends, she is just frustrated.""I paid you to find her, not come to me with empty hands!""And I am saying, there is nothing we could find. We have searched the roads, the wild lands, and the towns over. We have come up just as empty as you. We're sorry, we can give you most of the payment back." Anna paced back and forth, her slipper still in hand as she frustrated thought. "What about the forest to the north?" she asked."Are you insane? That place has been a deathtrap for a lifetime!""She could still be alive in there, and we will never know!" Anna said. "You are supposed to be men, a fearless band of men.""We are fearless, but also sensible. If we think something is a deathtrap, the group that has lads with death wishes, then it is a deathtrap. Donald here even has a child. How is the sonny boy Donald?""He well, captain!""That's great to hear Donald," he turned back to Anna, her face red from anger. "For a girl of your height you are sure feisty.""Find. Her! Or next it will be those balls you cherish so much!""No." Before he had finished sounding the 'o', he took another slap from her slipper. Two of the men rushed in and grabbed her arms to hold the flailing ball of anger back. "Weaklings! Sissies! Cunts, all of you! If you aren't going to do it, then give me your sword, I'll go do it myself!"The band escorted Anna, who was suited up with armor and handed her weaponry, to the edge of the forest. The wind blew aimlessly, with no moving critter in sight. The mass of trees seemed to extend far into the forest, stretching to infinity, till the eyes could no longer make out more trunks."Well?" The leader of the band said. "This is the northern forest.""I see that. It is as eerie as you said..." Anna said, all five feet of herself starting to go beyond the treeline. "I'm keeping my word, you don't have to worry about me.""We have standards lass," Donald chimed. "Quiet Donald, go back to your boy.""He has a point you know," the leader said. "We aren't one to leave a damsel alone. It's more of a new philosophy. Figures there is more business when people don't think that we just pillage and ask for sexual favors.""So what am I to you? A hole to extort later?" Anna said with narrowed eyes."That is the old philosophy. Right now, you are our damsel, and it is our job, to remove the distress." He came up to her and put a burly hand on her shoulder pad. "And the best way to do that….""...Is to not go in." Anna fumed in silence, before stabbing the sword into the ground. She started marching the way home, stomping on every little bump and leave she could find."Does this mean you will heed our warning?" The leader asked as she was leaving."Go rape a nun you barbaric donkey!" She yelled, masking the tears with anger as she continued on. "Oh Mizuki, what will I do now…"With the Minka now clean and proper, the spirit had finally decided to teach Mizuki the ways of a Yokai, starting with the scrolls in the compartment below the home. Candlelight now illuminated the walkways loaded with scrolls on either side much brighter than before, but it was still a far cry from the ideal place to read a scroll. "My god, must I read them here?" Mizuki asked, laying one along the ground to unroll. "It is tradition to do the scroll studies in the scroll room. Where else would be appropriate?" The spirit asked."The rock garden?" Mizuki questioned, still unrolling the scroll. It had reached the length of her height at by this point, and still had a sizable roll left before she could read the entire scroll. The symbols were thumb-sized and stacked with 6 in one column. This went on from end to end, which turned out to be twice her height by the time she unrolled the entire scroll. Mizuki groaned and fell on her side to the floor, not looking forward to reading each and every symbol. Which brought up another issue…."What is wrong Mizuki?" the spirit asked, feeling something off as well. Mizuki was stuck at the first symbol, staring at the bundle of lines drawn together. "I….I….""It is that why we haven't been speaking Japanese?" the Spirit questioned. "No wonder I have been talking to you in your dialect all this time.""I'm very sorry!""It is but a small matter," the spirit said. "As I have gotten your language from you, you can get my language as well. We are connected, after all." Mizuki felt a shiver go up her spine while her eyes flashed yellow. "There we go, now our minds can share our knowledge of everything." Mizuki was unsure it worked, but her gears started turning once she had taken a second look at the paper. Like she had unlocked a secret language, she started reading across the scroll. "No no, go vertically Mizuki.""Oh, oh right."Mizuki spent the next two days down in the scroll rooms, the spirit refusing to allow her to read anywhere else. Her only reasons to get to leave were to cook, sleep, and tend to the rock garden for her merriment. At first, she didn't see any difference after reading each scroll, but at least her eyes seemed to not be wearing down from the poor reading light."Hmmm…" Mizuki said at one point, looking at her assortment of vegetables. "What is so interesting Mizuki?" The spirit asked, confused about why she was just standing there."It has a….glow to it," Mizuki said, pointing at the carrot. Through her eyes, she could spot the mana that resided in the carrot, coming off it like a slow simmer of spiritual steam. She moved her hand through the gassy mana, watching it dissipate away."The room is finally showing its effects I see.""Effects?""As a yokai, it would be detrimental if you couldn't interact with the mana you control," the spirit explained. "The room must have deemed your mind ready, and therefore your body.""But all I have done has read…""Exactly! With knowledge, the rest can easily follow suit in your body," the spirit said, mentally putting hands on Mizuki's shoulders. "Let the dragon-ki seep into your body, and bless you more~"The haziness she saw grew more and more evident the more she read, even starting to permeate through the floorboards of the scroll room. It was like trying to walk through a fog, as she fanned away more and more mana just to keep herself from bumping into a wall. "It's everywhere!""That is the natural energy for you. You will have to learn to remove the mana from your vision on command.""How do I do that?" Mizuki said, bumping into the steps leading up to the ground. "Ow!""Focus and breath simply. As with all else, the rest will come…""Naturally. I know." Mizuki waited and sat on the floor, keeping her patience as the mist slowly disappeared from view. She repeated a longing to see normally as a human, and her surroundings obliged, letting the candlelight reach her eyes once again.It was only the first of the changes she would experience, however. She first realized it when heading to the river to clean herself, leaning over the water to scoop it onto her face. She caught a glimpse of her reflection, seeing her eyes replaced by completely yellow orbs with black silts. Likewise, she shrieked at first, thinking a doppelgänger was playing a trick on her, but the reflection didn't disappear when she left and came back. Her eyes were still a radiant gold, and now, two nubby horns had begun to protrude from her horns."Is this the dragon-ki's blessing?" Mizuki asked, poking and pulling at the horns. They felt like real, monster-esqe pointers, coarse and impossible to take out. She reached down into the river to take scoop some water into her mouth. The water stuck still like one large droplet instead of half of it slipping away, sliding around on her skin like butter. "I didn't even practice magic….""But you remembered the skills from the scrolls, no?" The spirit came in, back from being missing. Mizuki nodded, getting a wide-angle view of herself while looking at the water ball. "When you said, everything else will follow…""You will still have to hone your talent. Only the abilities will be accessible, but not necessarily the skill. Are you able to take that bubble off your hand?""Um…." Mizuki tried picking it up from her arm, only for it to stick to her other hand. "Not again!" The spirit chuckled and bid Mizuki adieu, leaving her to have to deal with taking off the water from her body. She ran back to the Minka, figuring that her fastest answer could just be lying somewhere in the basement."Water, water, water…." Mizuki said, skimming through scrolls to find something to help her. The water seemed bad at first, but her grip was so strong that the bubble rubbed against the scrolls like a balloon. She soon found the scroll she was looking for. She scanned it closely, groping the bubble with her free hand while she read. A pop of water jolted her while she was reading the last line. The bubble broke in her hands, becoming water that had splattered onto the floor, and a hand that had lost some skin and filled the gap with golden, shiny scales.Some moons later, Mizuki hath woken up in a completely transformed body. Two translucent fins with golden skeletons had grown out as a result of learning to communicate to animals. Her hair had turned white, and her horns grew larger along with her bank of mana to practice spells. Her legs had fused into a tail while she was at leisure in her river; that transformation was hectic, but then with the right scrolls, she had learned to fly and hover, so she wouldn't have to practice moving around on one limb.She got up, stretching her arms and lower limb. The tip of her tail slid up the wall, wiggling around until she pushed herself upright and started walking, eh, sliding over to the rock garden. Butterflies greeted her as she slid the door to the side. "Morning!" She chirped, one of the butterflies landing in her hair to rest. They kept her company while she rearranged the rock garden once more. Her pictures in the gravel had gotten more precise, with this one being an etching of her past neighbor. "Have you met her?" Mizuki asked the butterfly on her head.Flap, Flap."Yes, she does have hair like me…but soon, we will be able to see her again. One last time…" Mizuki said, raising a golden finger to the butterfly. It hopped onto the finger, flapping once more."I mean, I won't be able to live beside her no longer…"Flap, flap."Do I want to? Well….no, no, it will distract me from my duties," she answered, shooing the butterfly away. "Silly butterfly.""Silly indeed," when the spirit that lived inside her head. "I am proud of you Mizuki. You have made so much progress in so little time, anyone would have been glad to mentor such a quick learner.""I couldn't have done it without you, spirit.""Please, call me 'Anna'," she assured. "Although, that would make it harder for our last scroll…""Oh, but the previous ones were so much fun. The lesson on making a thunderstorm was so lovely to experience the first time…" The voice chuckled at her endearing comment. "It was a bit shabby, and my writing during that time was frantic. I should have taught you not to pour too much mana into the spell. I just hope nothing notable happened, wherever the rain went.""I'm sure it was fine! At most, maybe a few plants would be extra delicious with the mana. Let's go read the last spell." Mizuki walked inside, opening the door to the scroll room and heading down. She went to the deepest parts of the room, where the final scroll in the bottom right corner was tucked away. She took it and opened it on to the ground, humming until the last bit of the paper had come out of the scroll. She picked it up and started reading, her pleasant tune coming to a stall once she got past the first three lines…"It's time for us...to part?" She read out loud."Mizuki," the spirit started. "We both knew this was coming. After all, my time to go has come.""But we have only been together for a season!""That was plenty of time to watch you grow into the role," the spirit assured. "I'll miss watching you bumble around the kitchen. If only you were as good as cooking as you were flying…""I'm fine for what I need," Mizuki joked, starting to read the rest of the scroll. Once she was done she rolled it up, taking a deep breath and holding out her claws. "It has been a pleasure Mizuki.""It has been an honor, Anna." The misty mana felt like it was being pulled out of her body, concentrating on her palms as a simple white orb of mana. She could feel the presence of her mentor leaving her, leaving only the powers that the dragon-ki had bestowed to her. She put the scroll back and went upstairs, seeing a new kimono of white and faded golden flower stems, placed beside the pot and stove. One last gift from beyond her grave, she supposed. She put it on, letting the sleeves hang from her elbows instead of sitting on her shoulders. "I will fix it later," she decided, moving into the kitchen to take her place on her chair. The orb sat in her lap, pulsing idly while she looked out towards the hillside. Everywhere, the forest and the land...was all hers and hers alone.Mizuki flew through the air, holding her new scroll with all the information she needed. "Nabu was nice," she said to herself, flying through the night sky. "If only you were there to see it, Spirit Anna."On her way to the forest, she passed over her old village. She could see all the people milling around, living on as if nothing had happened. The crops and trees were just about to finish ripening, most likely needing her touch to make it happen. It was her duty after all. She then saw Anna, who had somehow gotten up to the top of her house and was staring at the moon."That's strange. Human Anna would never do something like that," Mizuki thought, materializing the orb that was her mentor. "What do you think, Spirit Anna?"The orb, of course, didn't answer, but its pulsing made it feel all the same. Mizuki decided why not, and decided to dive from the sky to see what was going on.…"God," Anna started, resting against the chimney of her home. "You are the only one that hasn't failed me. I won't yell at her anymore, I won't turn her away when she drags me on "tomato-watching. Please," Anna said, getting on her knees and putting her hands together in prayer. "Please bring back Mizuki…" A claw fell upon Anna's head, pulling her entire torso upright. "Get out of that position, it is not yourself at all…" Anna's heart sank when she felt the claws, its sharp edges digging through her mortal clothing."I said stand before thee!" The voice repeated with a distortion. Anna began to sweat, being turned around on top of the building. Two slits looked down on her, with a body of a snake-woman, but the horns of some mythical dragon. "Oh, I forgot to say please, hehe." Anna wrung herself free and moved back on the roof, breathing heavily. "Y-you don't scare me succubus!""No, I'm a deity, not a succubus," Mizuki said, her tail not even touching the roofing as she hovered close to Anna. Anna was running out of stepping room if she wanted to get away. "Would a succubus come to answer your prayers, Anna?""Only a succubus would have such huge bosoms," Anna exclaimed, pointing at the D cups on Mizuki. Her smile left, replaced by a flustered blush while her claws hid them from view. "The spirit never told me my breasts grew….ow!" Anna threw her shoe at Mizuki, taking off her other one. "If I'm going to die, I'm going to die with honor slut!""Don't jump Anna, I need to tell you something about Mizuki!" The Ryu made a lunge, but Anna was too fast, jumping off her home into the embrace of pain on the ground."No!" Mizuki yelled as mana shot from her, changing form from invisible mist to water to become a water bed. To Anna and any curious onlooker thought, it seemed that the water just appeared out of thin air, rushing to save the girl from breaking a bone or worse. She sank into the waterbed, being tossed half a foot before landing once more in it. Mizuki came down quickly, looking too and fro before rushing Anna inside her own house."Get off me, just slay me where I am!" Anna yelled. "I will rather be dead than a-""My Shirohebi?" Mizuki offered hastily."What?"
  
    Chapter Text
    Anna was hiding in the kitchen of her home, staring out every once in a while to see if the Ryu-Demon thing had moved any closer. It sat on the ground, her tail coiling around her before the end snaked under one of the chairs. Her poker face always seemed to look on at Anna whenever she peeked. She hid again, before poking her head out once more to check on it.“Do you not believe me?” Mizuki asked. “I really am Mizuki, your neighbor! The orb has just changed me, but I’m still her!”“Yeah right,” Anna said, not falling for any weird motives she could have. “What did you do with the real Mizuki? Where is she!?”“She is right here! Anna, you’re always like this with new people,” Mizuki said, sighing in disappointment. She had to figure out how to convince her friend before someone else came and made the situation worse. She tried materializing the orb of the spirit, putting it in the palm of her hand. “Hey, I still can’t take this off!” She tried, trying to jar memories of from before she left. “Hot water, huh?”“A demoness could easily have taken your memories! Scram!” Anna said, ducking back behind the wall. Mizuki was back to square one, only with less time to figure something out. She thought some more, but if memories weren’t going to work, then her mind was out of ideas.Anna waited from the safety of the room she was in, but she heard the sound of clothing hitting the ground. She peeked back around, seeing the evil spawn removing her kimono from her body. Anna got a mix of unwanted arousal and fear, seeing her breasts practically jump out of her clothing. Instead of witnessing an attempt at seduction though, she saw her fall on the floor, holding her fingers to her temples while she started to think hard. “What...are you doing?” Anna said.“Clothes make me think less,” Mizuki complained. “At least I don’t have feet anymore. Now no one can tell me to wear shoes…”‘Mizuki never wore shoes,’ Anna recalled. She always told her off for it, although Mizuki never listened. It wasn’t just shoes or footwear either; in the rare moments she would tolerate her, it will always be ruined by Mizuki saying that “she felt tight” and having her clothes off faster than a fly could zoom.Anna was finally starting to concede that demon-dragon there was Mizuki. She came out from her hiding spot, taking a stick with her as protection. The dragon didn’t open her eyes, having to get poked in the boob before she noticed Anna. “Baka,” Anna said, poking again. “I could have easily hit you in the neck, demon-spawn.”“I will never hurt you Anna, am I really that different?” The Ryu said.“So, you really are her?” Anna asked, gripping the stick harder. The Ryu nodded, starting to smile. “Then that will make it all easier then!”“What?"
  Twack!
"Ow!” Mizuki got thwacked in the cheek, sending her reeling onto the floor. Thus began a barrage of attacks, as Anna repeatedly beat the Ryu down. “Baka, baka, baka! I told you will become a demon! Now look at you!” She said, pushing her stick into one of Mizuki’s boobs. “You were nowhere this lewd before, and your legs are completely gone! How do you even walk? You will be shamed the moment you move back here.” Anna’s words hurt Mizuki more than the stick, which with her new body didn’t do much damage at all.“I’m not moving back here,” Mizuki admitted, curling up in a ball. “I-I’m staying at the Minka, i-in the scary forest…”“So you just came to say bye, before you start your life of sex-less solitude,” Anna presumed. “I won’t stop you, you have always been a bother anyway.” She turned around, waiting for Mizuki to make her exit while she scratched her side. She didn’t want to have to be the one to leave...“No, I...I wanted to you come with me," Mizuki said. Anna turned her head. “As if I will go with a demon. You have brought your loneliness on yourself.”“But I need someone to help me with my duties!”“What duties, to corrupt us?” Mizuki shook her head and pointed out the window. Anna rolled her eyes and looked out, seeing the crops blowing under the light of the moon. “Those are just the wheat, my friend.”“Yes, but...there really was someone watching over them. The superstition, it is real!” Mizuki enthusiastically said, sitting up on her tail. “But now I am the deity watching, and the spirit...it wanted someone to help me.” She prostrated in front of Anna, her hair splaying all over the place from how fast she bowed down. “Please, be my Shirohebi!”Every single brain cell in Anna pointed towards the obvious answer. She didn’t even completely buy that Mizuki was the Ryu pleading to her like a slave. So what if she threw a fit over her neighbor? Any concerned neighbor would be afraid for someone else. No need to follow her and be the only thing that could keep her company...although.“Will I be taller?” Anna said out of the blue. “I just want to be more intimidating, that is all.”“Does that mean you’re coming?” Mizuki said, hugging Anna before she could answer. “I’m so excited!”“I am only coming if you make me taller!” Anna yelled out. “And get your breasts off me!” “So Mizuki?” Anna said, being brought into the empty bedroom of the deity house. Candles were lit so Anna couldn’t bump into anything, but there was nothing in the room that they could illuminate. Only the futon that she sat on, and the hard wooden floor below.“Yes?” Mizuki called from the basement, sifting through the many scrolls of the basement. She remembered a few that had instructions for transformation, looking through scrolls so she could have a refresher. Finally, she opened one that started with something she recognized, taking it up to Anna. “Here it is, the s- tallness scroll,” Mizuki lied. Anna saw through it, plucking the scroll out of her hands. “I am already here, so you might as well say what will happen to me. Am I going to get a degenerate look? Seduction powers? Big Boobs? Height?”“No seduction abilities, and maybe the breasts, but this scroll is to turn you into a deity yourself, and my underling.”“No no no,” Anna said, holding up a finger. “I will not be your underling. Do you even have any idea how to ripen crops?”“Well, I read about it once….”“Ah! Once,” Anna said, hopping up to finger-bap Mizuki’s nose. “You may have become this demon-deity thing, but you haven’t mastered anything at all, have you?”“I can cook very well, and fly!” Mizuki exclaimed, floating herself off the ground. Anna arched an eyebrow, staring at Mizuki until she gently touched back down on the ground. “Well, I can fly very well.”“Disappointing! You are the same Mizuki that abandoned me a moon ago! All you have now is flight and boobs. That spirit would be ashamed,” Anna said, opening the scroll. “It’s obvious what I have to do now, I can’t be your underling.” Mizuki nodded solemnly. “Right...well, I will take you back….”“Take my back? No!” Anna said while skimming the page. “If I left, we will all die from starvation at the village! You don’t need an assistant, you need proper supervision before you bumble something up...ah, here it is,” Anna said, pointing at a point in the paper.“You are able to speak Japanese?” Mizuki said, surprised.“A fool that has eaten nothing but pig dung could read this. What, did the spirit need to help you with that too?” Anna scolded. “Am I the only one in the world that cares for being bilingual?” After getting a shameful glance from Mizuki, Anna scoffed again and continued reading. She held a hand out, the energy around her starting to gather in her palm. For someone who was only five feet, she had an immediate affinity for handling mana. Her clothing was immediately stretched as she increased in size (and height). Her ears became pointy like an elf’s but stayed as short as before. Her green eyes turned red, and her hair grew in length and volume until it covered her entire back like a curtain. Her legs did quite the unsightly fusion; she thankfully didn’t have any pants on, or else they would have been torn to shreds as her legs fused into one, elongating tell. Mizuki caught her before she fell, helping her to the futon as her tail finished transforming into a radiant white.“You’re beautiful~” Mizuki said, “but something is missing….” as she spoke, the last of the mana flowed in her, a brilliant set of c cups growing out of Anna’s breasts. “Dammit, I thought I had done the suppression proper,” Anna said, as she disappointingly groped at her flesh. The addition of her bosom stretched her already tight clothes to the absolute limit. Mizuki started moving to undo the clothing, but Anna put up a hand. “Wait. I have the power of fire, there is a better method now.” The clothes instantly started to burn with red, then blue, then white flames, incinerating to nothing before the particles could even go airborne. Mizuki screamed and instantly covered her eyes.“Shut it!” Anna said, sitting up with a hand over her breasts, her tail tip flicking over to hover over her crotch. “Just give a kimono, or something….”
  
    Chapter Text
    With Anna around, everything suddenly felt like it had meaning. She had the forest open and lively in only a few days, swarming with wildlife that she had “obtained” from other areas. She went around and burned the grass, creating two paths that intersected through the forest. The northern line passed their shrine, where people could come and ask for a blessing. She had Mizuki work on connecting the forest, making her clean away grass to make paths to whatever villages she could find.After washing away grass from sunrise to sunset, Mizuki was made to master the art of crop ripening, stowed away in the scroll room to read and practice ripening a tomato, over and over. It could have been any vegetable, but Anna chose the one that was the least likable for her to practice on.At the very least, each time Mizuki was let out, the deity was treated to clean sleeping quarters and a meal fit for a king. Anna was maid and manager, her servant and criticizer, combined into one, visually blessed fire snake.The results showed as well. Mizuki was doing her daily pattern in the rock garden, when she saw Anna come around the back, effortlessly holding two men in kimonos by the collar. Anna herself was wearing her new kimono; a white, shoulderless, armless one with a high collar. From it, the fabric completely covered her breasts and did the same for her back. Additional parts were sewn to the dress’s sides to hang her forearms, with a purple knot rope around the collar. “I found these hooligans disgracing your statues, Mistress Mizuki,” Anna said, tossing them roughly before her. “I think they are….mortals.”“No Anna, that is no way to treat guests,” Mizuki said, setting aside her rake to help the groaning humans up from the ground. Their faces were smeared with dirt, their clothes having charred holes in them. Mizuki looked at Anna with concern. “They shouldn’t have been near the dragon statues without notice then,” Anna said unapologetically. “However, if this is an error, I shall take my punishment and return to my duties.”“Sew them new clothing, at once," Mizuki commanded. Anna nodded and bowed, before heading inside through the backdoor. She turned to the travelers, one who took of his backpack and got on one knee. “Thank you for your mercy,” he said with an uneven voice. “W-we come from the north, and have heard news of a being that could ensure a plentiful harvest…”“Yes, that would be me,” Mizuki said, patting his head with her large claw. “You may refer to me as the….oh, I don’t have a title. Anna!” “Will ‘The Ryu of the Harvest’ be sufficient Mistress?” Anna shouted back, busy with her knitting.“It is fine,” Mizuki said. “Did you two hear that?”“Yes, Ryu of the Harvest,” they said simultaneously. The one with the backpack opened it, inside a few crops from their homelands. “It has gotten chilly in some areas, and we fear that turnips will suffer if winter comes too soon. We humbly ask for your help, before it’s too late…”Mizuki nodded and held out her hand, an orb full of mana rising up out of her palm. They stared at it, their faces illuminated by its golden glow. “Thank you!” one said.“Not yet. I have a few...conditions,” Mizuki said. They stepped back, nodding. “Anything, what do you ask of us?”“Compensation. A portion of your crops, once the amount exceeds your normal hull. And your devotion,” Mizuki said, tapping her chin to wonder if she was forgetting anything. “Anna!”“Explain how to use the orb!”“Thank you,” Mizuki shouted back. “You must take this orb to your village, and place it in a middle location. Let its power watch over you, and do not disturb it. Only then, will your food’s full potential be realized.” She finished by holding her hand out for the backpack. Once the traveler gave it, she gently slid the orb inside, closing the backpack to hide its glow. “Carry with great care. And please, wait at the entrance next time. Before, you know who….”“We will not make that mistake again,” said the second traveler.“For your sake, I hope not. If you do not hold up your end of the bargain, your crops might meet a fiery death instead of a chilly one. Farewell!” She waved pleasantly, leaving the travelers laughing out of apprehension and fear.Most of her first interactions went like that, with the newcomers slowly learning that possibly waiting for her or Anna to take notice was safer than being burned indiscriminately. Mizuki had Anna install a bell after the 2nd time she punished someone, so now people could ring off the property instead of coming to the door.The last victim was a vampire as hard-minded as Anna, being hogtied and getting her rapier taken away by the time Mizuki had finished freshening herself up. In the end, all she wanted was a nice snack that could “cure a prolonged sadness” and was asking for a friend. In her case it seemed like anger, but each to their own the Ryu guessed.One day, a group eventually passed the shrine, causing a commotion with their laughter. Mizuki was beside the minka, getting along with a deer when the noise of talking made the deer run away. “No, wait!” Mizuki said, but the deer was already too startled to stay around. Anna walked outside, holding a pot of steaming stew. “Was your relaxation disturbed?” She asked, a fire lighting on her tail.“No need for harm, I can just talk to them,” Mizuki said, going to the passersby while Anna went back inside. She waded her way around trees and bushes, coming out onto the front of the path to cut the group off. “Hiiiiii,” Mizuki said. She got multiple greetings in return. “Thank you, ah, well, I was peacefully connecting to nature, but you’re talking has sort interrupted my train of thought,” she explained, using hand gestures for emphasis. “If you would tone it a small part down, that would be fine.” One of the men laughed at her proposal. “As if we would listen to some weird monster!” He said, before being promptly hushed by a water tentacle that rose out of the ground, stuffing his mouth like a gag. The people around him side-stepped, but the rude fellow was too late to run.“Now, does anyone else have any objections?” Mizuki said with the same welcoming smile. “What are a group of men like you doing in this forest anyways?”“H-he was the annoying one in the group anyway. Going to enjoy ourselves on the mountains, of course,” another one said, taking skis from the holsters on her back. “It’s the new pastime!”“Skiing?” Mizuki asked, never having heard of that word before.“Yeah, I suppose you could still ski with a tail for legs,” another person said, suddenly realizing she had a tail. Humans don't have tails. “Wait, did we pass somewhere important?” they asked.“Yes, you did. Well, I should definitely look at this “skiing” that you refer to.” They bowed to each other and started walking away before both sides remembered that there was still a man choking on a water tentacle.“Oh right!” Mizuki said, letting the water collapse on the ground with a flick of her wrist. The man dropped to her knees, coughing profusely as the water had gone down his throat. He got up, still holding his Adam’s apple as he stumbled along behind the group.“And they had these weird flat poles on their backs,” Mizuki said, sitting outside. The door had been open so Anna could listen to her while preparing food, grabbing the sizzling fish with her bare hands to flip them. “It was strange, but I think it had something to do with the skiing.”“I don’t know what this skiing is, but it is most likely not related to anything we are concerned with,” Anna said. “I advice forgetting about those flat sticks.”“You’re right, but I’m curious….” Mizuki moved a bit, looking at the alpines in the background of her forest. “What could they possibly be using those sticks for? Anna?”“Yes, Mistress?”“Prepare our fish to go, we are going to the Mountains!” Anna arched an eyebrow, dropping the fish back in the pot. “Mistress, we can’t just leave our shrine. We are important here.”“We aren’t public servants stuck to the minka, and we can simply fly there and back. No one will know we are gone.” Anna disagreed, but reluctantly wrapped the fish and tucked it under her arm. Mizuki happily took flight, Anna using a blast of fire from her hand as propulsion to do the same. She left the ground charred once she lifted off, watching the ground disappear below them.A cool winter chill replaced the warm fall the closer they got to the mountains. They saw the vegetation change to evergreen, and then just marshes as the elevation rose. They ran into snow-filled clouds before they knew it, emerging on the other side with flecks of snow that had gotten stuck on their hair and kimonos.“The fish is going to get cold,” Anna said, trying one last time to back. “It would be wise to eat it right now…”“You can harness fire, there is no worry,” Mizuki said. “Besides, we can see the mountains!” She pointed in front of her, to the hard rock and the lowest part of the snow caps. Below were smaller mountains, completely covered in snow. There, people were gliding down, going faster than she had seen birds go through the air. “That’s odd,” Mizuki said. “Could that be the skiing?” Anna gave her a shrug, caring more about how it was still snowing around them. Her affinity for heat made it worse, causing the snow to melt as steam off her. It was mildly irritating to feel it sizzle and she wanted to get indoors quickly.Thankfully her mistress started heading down, going to a large cabin that was distinguishable even from their height. As they got closer, they noticed that the large blob of brown was not one cabin, but an entire complex. The biggest building was multi-leveled and wide, with large trunks acting as pillars in the front. The building right next to the snow slope was populated with people conversing and moving about, the long flat sticks stuck to their feet. Some waddled over on their attached skis and boards, before leaning into a slide that rapidly sped up down the slow until they slowed down at the bottom and crashed into piles of snow at the end.“This may be a retreat Mistress,” Anna pointed out as they touched down in front of the massive building. Anna went to knock on the door, but the door freely swung open after Anna knocked once, opening to a brightly illuminated front corridor. Many people and mamono milled around, with almost all of them having some level of winter clothing adorn. Anna took Mizuki’s wrist, pulling her through the commotion to another door. There, was a front desk for the hotel, manned by a fox girl in a red uniform. “Welcome to the Zipangu Mountain hotel!” She said with a cheerful face. “Would you be booking a room here?” Mizuki slowly turned to Anna as a lightbulb lit up in her mind.“Absolutely not,” Anna said. “We are only here for this “skiing” contraption.”“I see, you wish to see the new amenity our head has added,” the receptionist said. “Well, I can set up a seat at the course for a tidy sum…”“Like hell are we paying to see people ski,” Anna said, moving past her to go straight to the snow hills. A block of ice rose to block her path before she could get away. “Huh?” She said, putting her arm out and shooting a blast of fire. It melted the ice with ease, but another one came up to keep her passage blocked.“I told you miss, you must pay or you will be stuck behind the barrier.”“A block of ice isn’t going to keep me from looking at someone going down a hill,” Anna irritatedly said. She broke down three more blocks, but another wall just appeared every time. The receptionist just looked on, her smile and inviting allure never fading. Anna sunk her hand into the ice block one last time, breaking a hole into it with brute force. She was seething.“Would you like to make a reser-”“I don’t need a reservation!” Anna said, breaking her hand back out. “You’re doing this aren’t you!? You whore! I will turn you into roasted fox!”“I assure you, it is completely out of my control,” the receptionist said, her ears wiggling as she heard a door being opened. “However, if you want to know who is, I think she is the one coming out right now.” The Shirohebi turned and shot a fireball towards the direction of the door, seeing it get parted effortlessly by a slash of a tail. It retreated back into the door, replaced by a kitsune in a blue kimono with various colored flowers designed onto its fabric. Her hair was tucked under a shower net, with slices of cucumber stuck over her eyes. Her bare feet and bundle of tails dragged along the floor as she came out, looking slowly around at everyone here. Her wide scope stopped at Mizuki.“Me?” Mizuki said, raising a finger to herself. The newcomer’s mouth widened to a small grin, the Ryu only left in more confusion as the head looked on with the face of someone who just spotted fireworks. “Well, well, well,” she started. “How the tables have...spun.”“Turned, Head Mervana,” said the receptionist. The one in the blue kimono snapped her fingers in disappointment. “Shame, and I have been waiting years to use that line.”“You know me?” Mizuki asked.“Of course. At least, I recognize a familiar spirit when I sense one. Come, we must catch up,” Mervana said, turning around and walking back, only to walk into the wall. She put her hand on her head and stumbled back afoot, murmuring words of annoyance as she took the slices off her eyes.She had led them to into her spa room, where more kitsune workers were busy massaging the other clients. “It’s been so long friend!” Mervana said, leading them around occupied beds. “Have had to find other things to do rather than spend time with you, so I took a look at the hobbies of mortals. Turns out, you can make a tidy sum off of what humans like, so I took to stuffing this hotel full of them.” She patted one on the back, then patted one of the masseuses. “It’s way more satisfying to drain their pockets than to take away their body heat as they die in a snowstorm.”“I don’t think they are suffering…” Anna said, looking at one of them sigh pleasantly. “Are you sure you are doing it right?”“Ah, but that’s the best part! I have something to occupy my time, and my customers have a snowy hill to enjoy.” A masseuse came to open the door they were approaching, steam rushing out of it once it was wide open. “I also get to find out about nifty things, such as this steam bath. I was told it opens your pores. Would you like to try it with me?”“It would be swell!” Mizuki said, going inside. Mervana followed, turning around at Anna. “Coming in as well?”“Point me to the skis.” The kitsune chuckled and pointed back out towards the door. “As you wish. Just go out the back and slither around until you see a bunch of people gathered on top of snow.”“Shouldn’t be hard to find a bunch of bufoons then,” Anna remarked, promptly leaving the two.“Is she always like that?” Mervana asked, closing the door behind them. It was just those two in the room now, alone with seats along the wall, and the vision clouded by the constant spray of steam coming up.“Only when something annoys her,” Mizuki answered back, sitting in the steam. It slid along her body like oil against water, continuing on. “But she is so helpful despite it.”“Sounds a lot like you, back then,” Mervana said, the steam getting absorbed in her tails. “Strict and regal, even in the privacy of your own space.”“I don’t feel regal right now,” Mizuki said. “Was the spirit completely different?”“Oh, very~. Those were the days, ruling over this land with an iron fist. You were the head, and I was just your content, aggressive fox. But then, you told me that the gods had decided your time was up.” She took a pipe out of her clothing, polishing it against her tails. “I visited you almost every day, until the day your body disappeared from the shrine…”“But that’s all for naught, because you’re here now! We can continue doing our duties together, just like the old days!” Mervana exclaimed, seeming excited to resume her friendship. “New you or old.”“Did we have steam baths like this one?” Mizuki asked. “This doesn’t feel relaxing.”“No, this is another amenity. I did say I had to find something.” Mervane sunk lower in her seat, leaning her head back so she was looking up towards the ceiling. “Only the steam gets into my fur, so now my tails and ears feel so heavy…”“Must be a hassle.” Mizuki jested, twiddling her thumbs while looking around. She hadn’t felt any of the benefits at all, only the heat that rubbed off the steam onto her skin.“It is….but it is very worth it,” Mervana said, her eyes closed shut. “Sometimes, I would just sit here, and let my personal spirit manage the resort…”“Mmmhmm...do you wish to show me any other amenities?” Mizuki asked. “I do not think this is for me.“Steam baths aren’t your thing?” the kitsune replied disappointingly. She flung water around when she sat up straight, her ears hanging limply from her head. “No matter. I do have other things that I can show you. I will need to wring my tails out first.”While Mizuki was busy being shown around, Anna had found the skiing hill. She took her place to the side and watched in disinterest as people went up and down the hill on the flat sticks. She couldn’t understand what was so interesting about people siding down on them. They had to trek all the way back up, no?A Hakutaku came up beside Anna, sitting down beside her. She brushed the snow off her bum and looked with her. “This place seems a bit out of element for a lamia,” she said.“If you think I am cold, you can leave,” Anna retorted. “I’m not some mere reptile.”“Fair enough, a grown woman can handle herself in the cold,” the Hakutaku said back. “It is strange though, I am supposed to be keeping tags on all of the Yokai, but here you are, unaccounted for and watching this new sport the humans have created.” She extended out a hand to Anna. “Nabu, if you want to exchange greetings. Actually, I must find out your name if you are a part of the association.”“You mean the group Mistress Mizuki is in?”“Ah, you are a shrine maiden! Now I get it,” Nabu said, taking a pen and a cup of ink out from under her hat. “Mizuki did not have a maiden of her own the last time I have met her. I must ask what happened, and then interrogate you as well. Is she here with you?”“And why would I tell you that?” Anna said. “Isn’t a maiden supposed to know where the head is at all times?” Nabu said disappointingly. “I don’t wish to resort to more harmful measures.” Anna let a smirk slip, holding up a sizzling hand. “I’ll kill you before you have the chance.”“You are talking up a bigger storm than some yokai can make. Fine then, it would be a good assessment of your ability.” Nabu turned to Anna, scooting around in the snow so her torso was well within striking range of the Shirohebi. “Make it clean maiden. I have business with the resort head, and ruining her ski hill isn’t my idea of a first impression.”“Your funeral.” Anna paused for a moment, then drove a hand engulfed in fire into Nabu’s chest. It crashed into the Hakutaku’s clothing, leaving only a patch of her green uniform burnt. The rest of the fire, dissipated in a fading ring, stunning Anna more than her hand stung from striking her. A delicate-looking hand pushed Anna’s hand away, as she checked the charred spot on her clothes. “Tsk tsk tsk. Well, at least you were somewhat quick. Now then, I assume it is my turn, since you seem caught up on why your attempt failed. But I am a nice beastman, so I will give you until the next skier hits the bank to tell me your name~” Anna’s head darted towards the hill, as she saw another human line up their slide down the hill. In one strike her confidence in her strength had been shaken almost completely, now she had herself to worry about. “A...An-”“Anna!” They heard Mizuki said, being followed by Mervana. “And Nabu, I didn’t know you liked snow.” Nabu nodded and looked towards Mervana. The kitsune shifted behind Mizuki to hide her presence. “I don’t mind it, but it could be better,” she said. “I was just making acquaintances with your maiden while I’m here. You should tell me if you are going to go get one, so I can keep track.”“Sorry, I might have forgotten….” Mizuki chuckled and stepped aside, hugging Mervana with one arm. “I was busy making a friend as well. Nabu, meet-”“Mervana! The one that will always get away.” Nabu said, adjusting her glasses. “I actually came to talk to her, actually.” Mervana stayed stubbornly quiet, took out her pipe again and put the mouthpiece between her lips. “I am not joining the YA.”“I have heard. Aren’t you ever worried about your resort getting caught in some trouble? It is highly advisable that-”“Do you think I would just let my place be destroyed? I don’t need an organization to keep my land safe,” she snapped. “In fact, who would want a pile of snow as their domain?”“I know a few Tengu that could seek interest.”“They would have to get through the snow,” Mervana said, turning to the Ryu while she took out tea leaves that looked used and wrinkled. She dropped them in the wide end of the pipe, the pipe lighting by itself as steam started to come out. “Mizuki, have you joined with them?”“I-”“In fact she has!” Nabu said, putting her hands on Mizuki’s shoulders. “A new member of a wonderful society.”“Good for her,” Mervana replied. “Now I have more people that can share ownership of my land.” Nabu glared disapprovingly, her grip on Mizuki’s shoulders tightening. “Sooner or later young lady, you are going to have to join. You have been just staying idle for centuries now.”“I send my rain and I make it snow. That is all that is needed of me,” the kitsune calmly said back. “Now while you go back and worry about your loss of influence to human contraptions, I am going to make some tea.” She trudged back inside, leaving a trail of pipe steam and tail tracks in the snow.“Mizuki,” Nabu said as she left. “I need you to talk to her. I just can’t seem to get through to her.”“I don’t think I will be much use Nabu.”“Oh don’t worry,” Nabu said. “You are much more useful than you think.”
  
    Chapter Text
    “Hello?” Mizuki said, walking into one of the doors of the hotel. The room was empty as well, save for a maid that was cleaning the room and preparing it for new guests. Mizuki excused herself and continued on with the checking of her rooms. She was trying to find Mervana, but where ever she retreated to in the hotel felt impossible to find. After checking another room, she slid down the door to the floor exasperated. “I’m never going to find her at this rate,” Mizuki said. “Sorry Nabu…”The hallway seemed to respond to her frustrations, as the room got darker and dimmer. She was looking into her lap at this time and in her feelings, but what sounded like a clap of thunder made her turn her hand up. A blue oblique form appeared, shaping itself as small balls of fire circled behind it. Eyes and fox ears sprung out like weeds, and her tails floofed out before the rest of her small body had a chance to finish sculpting itself. “Hello there,” said the fox spirit, leaning on one tail like a table while her head bobbed back and forth. “Are you having trouble finding your hotel room?”“Can you help me find Mervana?” Mizuki asked.“Sorry madam, but Mistress Mervana doesn’t talk directly to any guest!” The fox spirit said to her. “But I can address any problem you may have.”“Would she talk to another fellow yokai?” Mizuki politely asked, knocking on her dragon horns.“Another deity?” the blue spirit asked. “Of course! Mervana always welcomes other deities up.” the fox spirit led Mizuki to the middle of the hotel, then knocked on a random spot in the ceiling. A staircase fell down, creaking loudly and kicking up dust from its wood once it had thudded on the floor. “Now that I look at you, stairs might not be great for you,” the spirit said, shifting her gaze down to Mizuki’s tail. Mizuki waved it off and started going up, pulling herself up into the room above.She came into a mostly empty attic, with light rays coming through two ceiling windows. Everything look polished and waxed, but all for a lonely desk that sat across from the ceiling door.Mervana was behind it, smoking with her pipe as steam constantly billowed up from the wide end. Her eyes were closed and her ears were limply down in meditation.“Mervana,” Mizuki said, bringing her tail inside the attic so the spirit could close the door after her.“Mizuki. I presume you met Arkayda,” Mervana said flatly, not having her relaxed tone from earlier.“Yes, she was very nice and polite.”“She is my kitsune-bi Mizuki. I figured I would try one out at some point.”“She is very helpful.”“Indeed,” Mervana said, shifting a bit more up in her seat. “In fact, I would say that she is more helpful than the Yokai Association. She does part of my duties, she handles the guests, a pretty active fox spirit, if you do say so myself.”“The Yokai Association is pretty helpful too,” Mizuki says, sitting down on her tail like a chair. “I was able to get so much done in a moon’s cycle.”“Was that them, or you?”“Well, both.”“Elaborate, my old friend,” Mervana said, placing down her pipe. “I would love to hear every single detail.”“Well, i’ve had no conflicts with other yokai at all…”“Is that it? I barely have any myself,” Mervana said, looking out through her window. She turned back and shook her head, her lips pressed together in a neutral look. “No, no aggravated yokai around it seems.”“We supposedly have the occasional meeting…and um…” Mizuki didn't really come up with a plan, running out of perks to tell. The kitsune scratched her hair impatiently, seemingly bothered by something. “Mervana, is something wrong?”“I can’t wait any longer. Mizuki, I know why you are here!”“W-what?”“You let Nabu bring you up to this? That just because I have care for our relationship, it would mean I will go along with you like some fox with string dangled above it?”“No, I-”Mervana scoffed and turned the back of her chair to Mizuki. “I thought you would have been better, but I should have known from the moment Nabu recognized you. You don’t even realize the trap that you’re in…”“What trap? She has been nothing but nice to me!” Mizuki said. Mervana looked to the side. “I don’t know, but if something happens, I rather be able to choose what I am able to do, rather than wait for a council anyways.”“At least then I would have a council to count on,” Mizuki said. “So what if Nabu asked me to do this task? She just wants to help you.”“No, she wants to do her job,” Mervana clarified. “It is her job to bring people into the association. Frankly, it is one of the few things I detest of her.” Without warning, Arkayda flew up with two hot cups of tea, each with two or three leaves floating around in them. Mizuki jumped an inch or two caught of guard, while Mervana calmly nodded and took her cup, the other being placed on the desk before Arkayda disappeared.“I don’t think I could get used to that…” Mizuki said.“You learn eventually,” Mervana responded. “So, what will you do? Let yourself become another poor soul, or join me in free agency, just like the old days Mizuki?”“Well…it’s tempting, but I think I will stay with the Yokai Association,” Mizuki answered nervously. Mervana gave a forced chucked and sighed, reclining into her seat. “Poor soul it is then, no point in expecting anything different. To souls then!” she said, raising her cup of tea.“To my trapped soul,” Mizuki said, not as sure in the 'trapped' part as the both of them drank their shots of the tea. Also like alcohol, Mizuki started feeling light-headed, her thoughts slowing to the speed of molasses. “Mervana, this feels quirky….”“Do you like it?” Mervana asked, her posture wavering. “I came across this plant two centuries ago, it makes you feel so blue….” They both slumped over the table, having a strong urge to fall asleep. “I may have….forgotten that….the tea is meant to only be sipped slowly….”“Anna is going to be so...worried…” Mizuki said, slurring the last word. The both of them fell asleep, snoozing away in her attic.They woke up on the ground, the natural light having turned yellow as the drugged tea had kept them asleep the entire day. The sound of musical entertainment reached their inhuman ears, the two tossing and turning in each other’s grasp.“Arkyada...give me another moment…”“Five...more minutes Anna…” Mizuki said, pressing her head into Mervana’s belly. “Anna, this pillow is very nice….”“I think that’s my belly,” Mervana said, giggling and sitting up, hair and ears lopsided and messy. “Oh dear, we’ve been here till sunset…” Mizuki lifted her head, rubbing her eyes as she looked around. “I apologize….”“No worry, but, while you’re here, what about some “bonding”? Mervana said while she wiggled her eyebrows. “I’ll make it worth it~” Mizuki was too tired to get flustered, but she stuttered over her words either way. “I wouldn’t mind, no….”“When Mervana said “bonding”, I didn’t imagine that we would be going on a picnic,” she told Anna while she brushed her hair. “Do you think Arkayda will be there?”“I think we should just remain diligent to our duties, Mistress,” Anna said, studying a scroll while waiting on the Ryu’s futon. “You can’t justify being away from our shrine this long with a picnic trip.”“It will be fine, it is just a quick get-together and a few snacks. Did you prepare anything for the picnic?”“Only some fruits, since you say it is so quick,” Anna said, rolling her eyes. “Where are we going?”“To the fields north of the forest! She said she wanted to meet somewhere convenient for both of us,” Mizuki said, finishing up tidying her hair. “Wouldn’t that be nice?”“I suppose a few fires could clear enough area,” Anna said, rolling the scroll back up. “Can we get a move on then? I just want to hurry this up.”“Don’t worry, with my flying and your fire, we will be at the fields faster than-”“-I can finish the sentence!” Mizuki finally said as they land. Swaths of grass rising above their knees blew and blew in the light howl of the wind. “We didn’t get here that fast, you just paused in the middle of your sentence and stayed quiet until we were close to landing,” Anna responded. “Coming here was faster than going farther into the mountains, however.” Anna looked around from her spot, seeing a hand wave to them in the distance. “Is that her over there?”“It seems like it is,” Mizuki said, wading through the grass to meet up with Mervana. Instead, she found varying monster girls and men walking around, either with spears or with scythes as they cleared grass. She and Anna could only tell by their lower halves, as the rest of their bodies were hidden away under cloaks, and faces behind green wooden masks.“I thought this was a picnic,” Anna said. Two masked fellows notice them, pointing their weapons at the two while speaking to each other.“An ipsi sunt de animadvertit yokai qui sumus?”“Forte sphaerarum pollent, aliis autem nequaquam spectant.”“Si quid novi accepto respiciunt idem???” The first one asked. The second one seemed offended by the question, the two getting into a shouting match before they sighed and resumed holding the two at spearpoint. “Come, Mistress Seika will test,” she said, taking them through the activity. Behind all the grass being cut and moved was a tent the size of a small house. Window holes were cut into the sides, and the flaps had an emblem of a lamia, dawning crown feathers of red on her head. They parted the flaps and stepped to the side, closing them together behind Anna and Mizuki. There sat Mervana, conversing with other deities and Nabu, who was sleeping on the ground. In the center of it all was a purple-skinned lamia. Her hair and tail were a faded dark green, and a diamond was tattooed on the center of her forehead. Each time she turned, golden chains and jewelry shook and rattled. Snakes withered around on the ends of her hairs, moving around her body before being stopped by their root in her scalp.“Convivae non pervenit!” Went the spearholders simultaneously, the two promptly leaving Anna and Mizuki with the group there.“Do they really have to speak that way?” Mervana said. “I will never know if they are chastising me.”“Do you honestly believe I would let them insult you?” The purple woman said, plucking an orange from the center of where they sat. “That would be grounds for punishment.”“Your idea of punishment is probably to egg them on,” Mervana responded. “Hello Mizuki! Welcome to our casa, as the humans put it. Seika was so kind as to get her servants to set up this abode.”“Hi everyone!” Mizuki said, quickly going to sit down with them. “I see we already have food available, Anna had just brought more if you didn’t mind.” The sun seemed to beat harder into the tent as everyone’s shadows get more defined and black. “Anna?” Anna nodded and set down her basket, filled with an assortment of foods she randomly picked from her kitchen.“The selection seems pretty untailored,” Seika said, pushing down the bowl to check the more hidden vegetables.“It was short notice,” Anna responded flatly. “I was not expecting more than a kitsune.”“Shame, Sana isn’t going to like any of this,” Seika said. “Not a great first impression maiden. Servants should always be prepared in abundance. What do you think Namaru?”“Huh?” Anna looked around, not seeing anyone else that could answer to that name. Yet, a hand rose from below to poke her back. “What kind of trick-” she cut off her sentence when she turned around, seeing glowing white eyes in her shadow. The shadow grew from the ground, rapidly rising in a cloud of smoke. Its outer edge shot out like an explosion, leaving a white-haired yokai in a scantly-covering purple kimono. She had a pipe like Mervana’s hooked to her side, purple mist gently and eternally misting out of its end. “I don’t know,” Namaru started. “It doesn’t look nearly enough for seven.”“Namaru, glad you could rejoin us!” Seika said smugly. “Was this the moment you were waiting for?”“You forced my hand! I needed to get to the Ryu’s shadow, but then I had to improvise after you uttered my name. I should start a war with you, just for that.”“No wars…” Nabu said quietly, rolling over on the ground. Mervana spite-tickled Nabu’s nose, getting a sneeze out of the Hakutaku, but not her awakening.“You heard Nabu. Besides, my troops could never compete with your army. Have you released any souls in the past few days?” Seika asked.“None significant for you to know,” Namaru said, rooting through the basket and picking up a tomato. “Ah, I haven’t seen one of these in quite a bit! Where did you get this?”“I grew it from the garden,” Mizuki answered. “You don’t know what a tomato is?”“No, but it seems rare, so it must taste delicious.” Namaru took a huge bite out of it, sinking her teeth in hard while tomato water fell down to the ground. Anna and Seika visibly recoiled in disgust.“Yep, sweet and juicy!” She assured, talking with a mouth full of raw tomato.“That must be a war crime,” Anna said, quickly burning the ground to sterilize it. “This is too unbecoming to not be a war crime!”“Fortunately not,” Mervana joked, sad she had a way not to immortalize this moment.“You know what is a war crime though, staying in this tent,” Seika said. She clapped twice, guards entering the tent and kneeling (or going lower on her tail, however you imagine this). “Stipare omnia satus sursum, nos relinquens in loco hoc uitio contactis.”“Ita Domina!” The said back, promptly exiting. Minutes later, the roof was starting to be lifted, as several servants were carrying the tent by it’s stakes.“It was just a tomato!” Namaru complained.“You know nothing about what you have just done. You can’t eat everything that only comes around once a season,” Sekia said.‘Strange, someone I could like,’ Anna thought to herself as she went to pick up her basket. She had gotten her wish for a quick meeting, and now she was going to cash in. “Come on Mistress, it appears time to go home.”“I’ll leave too then,” Mervana said, stuffing Nabu into her tail mass. The four of them left among the commotion of smaller tents and collected grass being packed up. Soon, Seika was also gone, leaving Namaru to just stand there awkwardly, disappointingly chewing on her tomato. While she ate, a harpy with orange wings landed down beside her. Her tanned skin was completely exposed to the elements, save for an undergarment and accessories that only covered her nipples. A mandolin was on her back, hanging by a shoulder strap. “Hey, am I late? Early?” she said, keeping herself steady on her claws. “I had to attend a festival, where is everyone?” Namaru gave a look of solace, her eyes empty. “Gone Sana.”“What?”“G-gone….” Namaru said, sadly finishing her tomato and walking behind Sana. Her body started sinking into her shadow, dropping into the ground like quicksand. “I’m sorry little one….”“.....Huh?” Sana looked down at her. “What do you mean!?” She got no response, only the purple eyes of an innocent tomato eater before they were gone below the shadow.“I-I missed it didn’t I….”

    Mervana marched through the woods, turning the path and fauna frosty with each stride. Arkayda flew behind her, making sure Nabu stayed deep within her tails. “Mistress!” she said, catching Nabu’s hat slipping out again. “Why not call Namaru to make the journey quicker?”“Because my loyal fox spirit, Namaru disrespected the gods with her tastes.”“Aren’t you a god?”“Exactly,” Mervana said, putting a finger up like a professor. “By that metric, Seika and Nabu were also gods, and Mizuki is a newfound god. Meaning by us getting disrespected by her, gods were disrespected.”“Mistress, but we aren’t powerful enough to be called gods.”“We are to the humans, and trust me! That is enough for even Sana to be a god,” Mervana said. They came across a tower that rose to the top of the canopy. It was sculpted from what seemed to be a massive tree trunk, hollowed out and finely carved. A pointy spire pushed through the leaves, poking out to catch the sun before it was blocked by the browning leaves. A single door could be found with a block knob and nothing else.“Nabu really needs to get a better entrance,” Arkayda said, opening the door for Mervana.“This is just our entrance, the real hall of records is much nicer,” Mervana said. The place was completely dark, safe for the light that poured in from the outdoors. “Go on, do you mind glowing for a bit?”“Not at all,” Arkayda said cheerfully, her tails lighting up like fire. She flew inside, her blue light illuminating the inside of the tower. It was a spiral staircase all the way down, to a faint light that could barely be seen with the naked eye. “Why so long down?”“In case mortals came by. She says it makes her home look more like an ancient crypt than a living space.”“Even her bedroom?”“Marsaw will play the lethal guardian and shoo them off from there,” the kitsune answered, flying down the middle instead of taking the stairs. She floated down like there were balloons hanging from her kimono, touching down onto the stone floor effortlessly. “The door is still open,” Arkayda said, “Should I…”“Close it? Yes.” Mervana said, walking into the darkness while Arkyada went back up. She held out her hands, sliding along the walls while she traveled. After about several paces She felt something metal and smiled, feeling around it until she felt a handle. She grunted while picking the metal thing up, taking her pipe out to slide its side against the metal. Sparks few until one swipe got the lantern to light, the flame hovering above half-melted candle wax. “There we go,” Mervana said, holding the lantern up to her surroundings. Before her were tall shelves of books and records, going from the floor to the ceiling where the underground structure met ground. Their only ambiance was wind that managed to blow its way down and circulate around the library rows. She walked down the lane, looking at the covers of the books she passed. Most were scrolls, some were just bundles of thin tablets or paper held by adhesive or string, but a few were lucky enough to have a spine, maybe even a sturdy cover.“Damn library...where was your room again,” she complained, her voice echoing down the hall. One of the shelves shook beside her, making her step to the side in fright. “Arkayda?” she asked. “If this is another one of your jokes, wait till we get back to the resort…” Her ears were more alert, twitching at each noise and breeze. She had a small frown and a more urgent pace, her tails bundling around Nabu’s body tighter.All of a sudden, a faster and harsher breeze blew over her, blowing her kimono and hair out forth. More books fell beside her as she turned the lantern, frantically trying to locate her kitsune-bi. “Stop that! Before I assimilate you into myself! I’ll keep you down dormant for a month!”“The halls answered her back, with more wind rushing into her. It was like a hurricane had decided to strike only in that row, making Mervana stagger back. Her hand turned frozen as she swiped in front of her in a wide arc, sending a blade of ice flying like a bullet forward. It cut through the air and went beyond the candlelight, taking a moment before it could be heard shattering against the end of the hall.“Two months!”“Hooooo….” went the dark abyss, as if daring to torture her with an answer. ‘Wait, an owl hoot?’ Mervana thought, sweat beading down her forehead. ‘Why would there be an owl in here, the only one that hoots is…’ Her train of thought stopped upon hearing a flurry of wings and feathers land, loose brown feathers falling all around her. She raised the lantern and looked up, seeing yellow eyes and a face encased in brown feathers and hair. “Hoo~” Mervana shrieked and fell on her knees, clutching her chest to stop her rapid heartbeat. “Marsaw, why were you just in the dark?”“Hooot,” The owl mage said, hopping over to her tail side to pull Nabu out of her tails. “Hoo?”“She’s tired, the dumb goat woman keeps traveling too much.” Mervana, free of anything being stored in her tails, sat on her ass while her body snapped out of flight mode. “I am too old to be being scared like this….”“Hooo.” Marsaw said, cradling Nabu in her arms. Even as the fur made her look as large as a standing bear, Nabu still dwarfed her in height, her legs dangling off of Marsaw’s wings like the bed was too short to rest on.“Do you even have pastimes you do while she’s gone?” Mervana said, using one of the bookshelves to pull herself back up. “Or do you just wait in darkness and scare her?”“Hoo.”“Of course. I am going to need tea…” Mervana said, walking back with the lantern. Marsaw walked off, knowing where she was going perfectly. She maneuvered between book aisles to the end of the library, going through a door and lighting the candles. She had gotten into Nabu’s sleeping space, laying her down on her plain white bed and pulling the blanket over her. “Hoot…”With Nabu safely in her room, she left the hall of records, coming out through the main entrance. It was a temple of marble columns, arranged around a circle with nothing but a stand and a book. A platform shifted back behind the stand, Marsaw poking a wing through and hopping through the hole, before pulling the platform back into place on the ground. “Hoot,” she said satisfied, flying off. She totally had things to do, unlike Mervana thinks, and she was going to take you, the reader, along with her to-“Hoot!”Oh right, fourth wall break. *Clear throat*Marsaw went off, flying through the trees around the temple. It was part of her duties, to monitor the state of the temple. Technically, Nabu stated that the humans, as long as they survived the trip into the hall of records, were free to find all the knowledge they crave down. Marsaw narrows her eyes and digs her neck into her neck feathers each time Nabu says that.“Hoot…” She said, scoffing in owl. Humans in a yokai’s place? It seemed way too ridiculous to her. She flew around faster, trying to drown her feelings into the blur of her from going around in circles. She has had to fish too many humans out of traps. The number of how many could be counted on her left claw, but it was already too much for her. What could someone could die to fire could possibly due with something recorded in the language of the sun?There was at least one idiot though, that made her guarding of the temple worthwhile.She perched herself on her favorite spot on the outer wall of the temple, narrowing her eyes to focus on a small part of her vision. Two miles out, there was a being that vibed around, that did nothing but whatever her smol brain decided to enjoy. She had small nubby horns like a calf’s, rising up three inches off her head and curling back lightly. She was a shortstack, only coming up to Marsaw’s belly. Her skin was fair, with faded green-white hair that was always messy and coming down to her back. Today was also one of the rare days she bothered to wear something over her body. Marsaw had never gone over there to hoot at her, but it was a nice reprieve to watch someone enjoy the simplicity of life and nature.Although, watching someone out of boredom would drag questions out as your mind wandered from no activity happening for one to react to. Where does she get clothes? Why live in the woods? What is that dot on her body that Marsaw keeps seeing, but her eyes can’t focus hard enough to make out? She is obviously not a normal Holstaur from this realm; nothing she has done has indicated any horniness or lactation at all.
  Maybe she just hasn’t gotten close enough.
But for that, she would have to leave the perimeter of the temple. She looked back at the fairness of the walls and the columns, supporting the marble design that has held for centuries of data collecting. If a certain dark mage had gazed this, she would have probably orgasmed from how much she could introvert it up in there without human contact….But back to Marsaw, who was still internally debating. Hoots wandered around her head, giving reasons for and against seeing the cowgirl over there. ‘Hoot hoot hoot’ was really convincing, but ‘hoot hoot hoot’ raised a real good point about staying back.It was neck and neck, but one hoot seemed to stick out among the others. The hoot that could not be countered:‘If you go, maybe you will discover something new for Nabu….’It was tempting for Marsaw. It would benefit Nabu, who is already busy with documenting the day-to-day proceedings and changes and maintaining the hall of records as a whole. A discovered species, just vibing and enjoying herself on the forest grass, just waits out there for Marsaw. All she had to do, was leap off her comfortable branch…She nervously hopped around, stretching her limbs to prepare for the flight. She was no deity, but she was a mamono and yokai regardless - she could cover two miles fast, but whether it would be fast enough for her was another story. She extended her wings to their full threatening length, the wingspan looking as long as a boat as she adjusted once more and bent her knees. Like a spring she jumped off, keeping her wings wide for a moment of flight adjustment before folding and straightening her body like a dart. She was now nothing but a fluffy arrow cutting over the forest, watching as the cowgirl’s body grew in resolution the closer she got to her.She crashed down through the trees, sending branches aside on a beeline on top of the cowgirl. Right before she was about to crash, she extended her wings once more, air breaking herself to an instant stop as the wind continued its journey into the small girl’s face. “Hoo!”She saw the cowgirl look up, clutching her sweater while she looked at the newcomer owl. “Hoo,” Marsaw said again, trying to get words out of her mouth. The cowgirl only kept staring up, as quiet as a kid up past her bedtime.After a third hoot, she gave up getting her to talk. Maybe the small woman was just shy or scared. That made sense to the owl mage, but, there was only one way to find out then from here. Marsaw slowly shuffled closer, testing to see if she would move away. She put her wings forth out once she was a few feet out, sliding them to the sides of the lass and plucking her off the ground. “Hoot?” The smol girl mooed back immediately.“Hoo?”“Mooo.”“....Hoot.” Marsaw ended up preferring that she only mooed, rather than someone who spoke a full language. She gathered her belongings, which were only some food and a few random articles of clothing on the ground, and stuffed them under her feathers before taking off with the girl. She took her back to the temple, flying past her branch from before and landing in the center. “Hoot,” she said, telling the cowgirl to stay still beside her. She took the book in her wings, hooting five times while reading one of the pages. Runes appeared one by one along the edge of the circle, the platform from before sliding open with a chime once all the runes were glowing. She promptly put the book back and picked up the moo, hopping down into the hall of records once more.“Marsaaaaw!” Nabu said, calling out to her Owl Mage from her room. She had just woken up, slightly disoriented from being moved in a bushel of foxtail. She plucked fox hair and loose feathers off her body while she looked around. “Are you there?”A loud hoot reverberated back, echoing through the halls. Nabu nodded and clapped twice, a candle lighting in her room and hundreds of flames lighting throughout the library. She walked out of her room, standing at the top of the stairs that lead down to the main floor. “Marsaw? You would usually be watching me sleep…” she said, heading down the steps and walking along the ends of the rows. She found Marsaw, hovering in the air while scanning the scrolls and books high up. “Marsaw!”“Hoot.” She found a scroll she liked and pulled it out with her mouth, letting it drop to where her feet claws could snag it before it fell to the ground. “Hoot?”“You are doing research? Making a contribution to the hall I see.” Nabu nodded approvingly, rubbing her chin while smiling. “Well then, do not let me distract your studies.” Nabu walked away, headed for the main entrance to the temple. Marsaw took her scroll and went to the far corner of the hall, where she put down the cowgirl and all her belongings. The Owl Mage landed and sat down in front of the moo. Her amber eyes caught the stranger’s near-black ones. “Moo?”“Hoo.” Marsaw grabbed her, turning her too and fro like she was finding the label to a toy. Strangely, she found one; a small charm with a long, thin chain that was hidden under her sweater. The only thing on it though was the number 28. She looked at the charm, then the cowgirl, then back at the charm. She realized she couldn’t exactly get a name that she could designate her.28 it was then.The next order of business for her was to figure out the species. Marsaw opened her scroll, using her physical appearance to cross-reference her to all the pictures of monsters and monster girls. As she thought, the only one that came close was the holstaur, but 28 just seemed way too short and too docile to be certain she was. Marsaw took off her sweater to see if there was anything special under her clothing, but it was just the normal body that came with being a shortstack; A nice, slightly chubby human body. There was a holstaur tail, but anyone can have a tail nowadays….28 stared up at Marsaw while the Owl read through the scroll. Marsaw caught a glimpse of her mindless watching, suddenly feeling pressured on by her eyes. She buried her eyes into the book, but each time she looked up, the holstaur look-alike was looking up. “Hoot,” Marsaw said, excusing herself to go get another book. It was partly to take a break free from perceived judgment, but whatever let the owl hoot at night.Not that it was worth the effort. The next book didn’t yield any clear conclusions either. No description of any humanoid could perfectly represent the cowgirl in front of her. The next time she came back, she came with an empty scroll and a quill with the feather end held between her lips. She unrolled a bit of the scroll and started writing, documenting everything she knew so far. As she was writing by moving her head, she didn’t notice 28 coming closer to her, crawling on all fours to get a good view of the characters she was writing on the scroll. She bumped her head against 28’s chest on accident, instantly ducking back and staring at the cowgirl.“Moo?” 28 questioned, wanting Marsaw to keep writing. She didn’t get what put Marsaw off, but watching her draw with the quill was pretty compelling for her. Marsaw, on the other hand, made shooing motions with her wings, wanted 28 to move back so she didn’t bump into the naked woman. “Hoo-hoo.” 28 didn’t move, so Marsaw moved her for her, scooting her a foot back before going back to writing on the paper. 28 just moved in again, Marsaw unable to sit up with the back of head pressing into 28’s soft belly.The Owl Mage moved her to her side this time. 28 closed in once more, but this time, it wasn’t intrusive enough to Marsaw to warrant another hoo. She kept her crocheting position, holding the scroll still with her wings while writing.Sometime later, Marsaw felt some wiggling under her. She realized that 28 had gotten under her, pressing herself into a makeshift spoon. Her feathers were rather warm, Marsaw thought. Maybe she just needed clothes…Clothes she would go find then. She stopped writing and sat up, getting a confused look from 28. She mooed, wondering if the Owl Mage was done drawing. “Hoot.”“Moooo?”“Hoot, Hoo hoo.” Marsaw wrapped her wings around 28, getting satisfactory nuzzles into her chest feathers. She lifted 28 up, keeping her enraptured in her cuddle hold while shuffling over to Nabu’s room. Full-on walking was an option, but when was the last time she or any old owl walked the full trip?Nabu had thankfully left the lights on before leaving for her duties, so the only things left for Marsaw were to dress up her Moo-er. She got to the bed and started trying to pull her away, but 28 had found a good hug against her. Her wings were useless for applying pressure in precise places and were too loose and fluffy to effectively squeeze between her and 28 to try prying. Shaking was tempting, but she minded the cowgirl getting hurt. It hadn’t done anything to deserve a scratch, and a scratch it wasn’t going to get.Marsaw chose the waiting option, letting 28 snuggle herself out against her. Eventually, 28 did pull off her…....only to pull Marsaw to the bed to snuggle more. Marsaw watched her try to bring her by force, then gave up and hop on the bed on her own terms. 28 seemed happy that she went along with the idea, climbing on top of Marsaw and laying her down on the bed. She took the wings and turned them into covers, laying on the owl and using her large chest as a pillow.Marsaw merely watched, letting the 3 or 4-foot cowgirl take the reigns. She was never one for physical contact, although that was partly on the isolation of being a guardian. She didn’t react when she felt her thighs get rubbed, her body doing the responding for her and flushing her cheeks red. She eventually felt something moist against her fur, something that smelled like lust and watermelons….28 mooed and sighed all at once, her cheek flat against Marsaw’s chest. Marsaw realized that 28 had gotten horny from the contact, and that weird feeling against her thigh was the lips of her pussy sliding back and forth along her skin. Her eyes were closed as she clutched Marsaw’s sides, wiggling her ass as she rubbed herself more against her.Marsaw wondered if she should be doing anything, the fruity scent getting up into her nose. She got the urge to get more grabby, her wings curling around 28’s body more like a feathery bed burrito. 28 scooted up to Marsaw’s face, touching nose to nose and smiling with flushing cheeks as well.“Hoot,” Marsaw asked, wondering if 28 had any specific “requests” she wanted to be fulfilled, with the wet pussy and all. One moo was all she needed, as she let go of her and turned her around, facing 28 the other way. She spread her thighs, getting a peek at the cowgirl’s pussy. It was pleasant on her nose, bringing thoughts forth to dive right into her soft, supple flesh. For how much the cowgirl didn’t talk, she definitely somehow knew what Marsaw was thinking, because the small-bodied moo pushed her pussy into the Owl Mage’s mouth. She couldn’t even hoot against it. It would just mean opening her mouth to the moist flesh before her….“Moooooo…..” the 28 sighed, settling back down over her chest while her ass was safely rooted on Marsaw’s mouth. She seemed ready to sleep there even, yawning and nestling herself into her bed of feathers.“Hoot,” Came the muffled questioning from Marsaw. Her face was flushing red, catching the heat her pussy radiated. 28 just nodded and went back to lazying about. Was this just a game to her? The owl mage thought. Some lewd, awkward game? Doesn’t she know yokai are above sexual encounters?Apparently not, since her pussy was still in her face. Her mind went back to possibly forcing her off, but she didn’t want to cause any unwanted damage to the shortstack. There was only one reasonable way out of this, and that was plugging her relatively tiny hole with her tongue.28’s eyes awakened when Marsaw started lavishing her pussy. Her face grew a cozy smile, as she pressed her pussy harder. Her plump lips parted on Marsaw, squishing and rubbing against each other and her nose. Owl wings shifted up to her waist, gripping as hard as they could before Marsaw shoved her tongue as deep as it could go. Her eyes were shut tight, putting all her focus into licking 28’s inner canal. A moan here and there slipped through her mouth, all of the noise ending up as just further vibrations inside 28’s cunt.Finally, she pulled up for oxygen, her mouth smelling like the cowgirl’s nethers. 28 was just looking back at her, smiling with a red blush of her own.“H-hoot?” Marsaw said, feeling like a deer in headlights. She worried that her oral was terrible, if that her lack of sexual skill was never gonna free her from having a vagina smothering her face. She desperately went back to work, moving her oral limb haphazardly and all over. She worked feverishly, but it wasn’t working. She wasn’t hearing moaning, no squeezing of her cunt, nothing! What was she doing wrong?She hooted in frustration, her face redder than before. Throwing caution to the wind hadn’t seemed to pleasure 28 at all. There had to be a book right? A book on how to give Cunnilingus. If she could just manage to convenience her off, then she cou-“Hoooooo!~” Marsaw moaned, covering her wings and checking if Nabu had heard anything. Hell, the entire hall of records could have heard that. She looked back towards 28, realizing that she had shuffled away from her mouth, in exchange for trying a piece of the yokai herself. Pinched Marsaw’s clit between two fingers, while pushing fingers from her other hand into the owl mage. It wasn’t nerve-wracking, but it made Marsaw arch and thrust her hips up each time 28 slid and squeezed her sensitive bulb. It made her do everything she couldn’t make 28 do. And the cowgirl just kept looking on, smiling like a kid that had found a new toy. There wasn’t malice nor any intent of domination in her digits. Only a slow enjoyment, and the neat opportunity to lick her hands clean of the juices Marsaw leaked out.Marsaw grabbed Nabu’s pillow, clutching it to her chest and holding it tight. She hugged it, bit on it, drooled on it even, and tensed up around it with each finger added, until the shortstack had managed to coax her entire hand up inside her. 28’s face seemed to brighten, her hand-arm pushing into Marsaw’s pussy now that she could fist her mate as much as she wanted. Marsaw’s pussy squeezed gently, pressing shaping itself to 28’s forearm. The owl felt a slow but sure climax approaching; 28’s hand grew faster and faster, feeling Marsaw continue to kiss and suck on her hand with her lower mouth. Drool had soaked one corner of the pillow without the owl mage realizing it.Soon enough, Marsaw couldn’t bear it anymore. She squeezed the last bit of the way to the top of the mountain, humping against 28’s arm until the climax bloomed out from her pussy. And washed over her like an ocean wave, making her curl up and relax as her pussy repeatedly clamped down. She fell back into the bed once the last spasm happened, hooting as she felt sapped from all the pleasure. She thought it was over, that she was finally out of the woods…She had forgotten though, 28 was still left unattended. She opened her eyes, feeling 28’s vagina once more, except this time, it was touching against her own. She sat up, using the bed for support. Her cunt was still sensitive, namely her clit, which got a firm sensual mashing from the smaller, more skilled crotch. She hooted against the bed frame and saw 28 had started to move, gyrating her hips to grind her pussy against hers. Marsaw hooted more, joined by moos from the cowgirl herself. Marsaw couldn’t help but move with her, mimicking her gyrations and pressing her pussy into 28. They both tribbed together, enjoying each other’s company and kissing their pussies together repeatedly. 28 was finally moaning out loud, panting along with Marsaw while they both worked another orgasm out from their pussies. Marsaw was somehow the first to break, getting a second orgasm out quickly and grinding against 28 for a few, hard moments before falling back into the bed twitching. 28 followed suit, cumming and squirting onto Nabu’s bed before falling into the sheets.Marsaw finally had a lull, but she could do little about it. She panted every other breath, her body still coming down from her orgasm. She felt 28 come up under her arm, getting blotches of her cum on the wings as she wrapped the arm around herself and went to sleep. Marsaw watched her doze off, hopefully for real this time. She was getting tired as well, the urge to sleep replacing filling her mind the more her arousal left.“Hooooot…” was her final words before she dozed off too, thinking that maybe Nabu would be alright with a little nap….Marsaw woke up at the sound of rain, jumping upright with her hair and feathers all over the place on her body. Quickly matting down her body, she peeked outside the room. The halls looked dark and empty, thank heavens. She turned back to 28, who she had placed down on the bed. She was fast asleep, spread out over the middle of the bed.“Hoot,” she said, going over to pat her head, then flying off through the darkness to return to her post. She could get back 28 later once she found that book.
  
    Chapter Text
    “Isn’t this great Anna?” Mizuki said, taking a stroll through her hometown with her trusty Maiden. The two attracted the eyes of all the townsfolk, many of them dropping their tasks to watch the two yokai leisurely slide their way down the street. “It’s finally here, my favorite day of each year, but now we caused it!”“Yes, but can’t we enjoy autumn from somewhere more secluded?” Anna said, watching a leaf land on her shoulder. “And preferably roofed?” she then asked, plucking the leaf with two fingers and burning it to a crisp. She turned towards the people watching her, some parents hiding children behind their back.“Go back to work!” She commanded, watching the people scramble and quickly walk away to their own things.“Mistress, we are way too exposed out here,” Anna sighed, catching back up to Mizuki. “Couldn’t we fly instead?”“But then we couldn’t take in the smell!”“The smell?”“Don’t you sense it?” Mizuki said as they were coming up on the farm. Besides Anna, she seemed willfully naive of any human being around her. “All the different scents that blend together once everything ripens?” Anna sniffed the air, not sharing the Ryu’s enthusiasm. “I only smell charcoaled leaves.”“You aren’t trying. No matter, we’re here!” Mizuki made a grand gesture to the orchard they arrived at, with acre’s worth of trees filled with various fruits. She plucked one of the apples from a tree, the apple rapidly grew in her hand, rounding out to a beautiful shade of red and shining against the sun. “This one’s excited for me, am I right Anna?”“Yes, but careful, you are accelerating that fruit’s life.” Mizuki looked down, gasping as the Apple started breaking down in her hand, the apple turning into a gooey rotten mush that fell through the gaps between her fingers. “I didn’t know ripening would do that…”“I’m sure it was somewhere in the scrolls….”“No, I’ve read the scroll on ripening. Nowhere in it mentions disintegration!”“Impossible!” Anna took Mizuki’s hand, inspecting it like a bloody glove. “The spirits wouldn’t let such a detail slip. Your mind must be faltering.”“I assure you my mind is a bear trap. I’m willing to bet my left ear that the scroll does not contain this nugget of information.”“Are you saying-” Mizuki nodded, smiling with a devious glare and puffing out her chest. “Yes, we are going to…”“....go add our contribution to history!” (“Leave this human-infected place!”)Mizuki looked at Anna while she yelled something that was not at all what she herself had in mind. Anna quieted down and trailed off, realizing the same. “Yes, add a contribution. I will ensure the path is quiet…”Anna and Mizuki entered the scroll room, Anna clapping once before white light illuminated the room tenfold. “You installed new flames?” Mizuki asked, able to see everything as if the sun had come down into the room itself.“I do not know how you are able to read in here, we will need bifocals with how dim the candles are.” With that they went to the general area that they remembered the scroll was and started pulling out scrolls at random. They got lucky as it only took a few tries before Anna pulled out the right one. “Aha!” Anna exclaimed as she saw the starting sentence. “This is the right one.”“Wonderful, is there any paper at the end?” Mizuki asked. Anna started unrolling the scroll, Mizuki holding the length of it while Anna worked her way towards the end. She went until the rolling stopped, staring at the paper closest to where it was attached to the core. “The characters go all the way to the end, shame,” Anna said. “We can’t add to it.”“What?” Mizuki peered over, seeing the handwriting using up every bit of space on the paper. Not even a random spot to cram one word was available. “Well, we can’t attach new paper willily nilly…”“Of course we can’t Mistress. The scroll starts at the end,” Anna sighed, rolling back up the scroll. “Although, I didn’t catch any note of advanced ripening. It looks like you are keeping your ear.”“I knew it!” Mizuki celebrated, before hearing a swift sizzle. She looked at Anna, who was holding her pointy lamia ear. “....”“This was the bet, no?” Anna said, extinguishing the flame around her hand and holding her head to stop the bleeding. “It is no issue as a...ow….maiden…”“No no, please put back on your ear. That looked painful….” Anna nodded and pressed the ear back to her head, lighting one finger with a sharp flame and welding her ear back to her head. Mizuki took the scroll and put it back, putting a hand under her chin. “Well what now? I feel at a complete loss for this….”“Well, I have only been a yokai for as long as you have,” Anna said, wincing as she put the fine touches to the burn stitches on her ear. “But as this is a collection created over time, is it not reasonable there is a scroll that details how to add to a scroll?”“That...makes sense.” Mizuki cleared her throat and looked around in the corners, guessing this meta-scroll would be there. “We should add a system to these scrolls,” Mizuki commented. “Did our predecessors expect us to recall each and every one?”“Our minds wouldn’t be as much of a bear trap if we didn’t…”“Whatever Anna,” Mizuki said, picking up a scroll and unrolling it. “神社の巻物....oh, sorry. Jinja no makimono…”“Translation, not transliteration Mistress," Anna pointed out. Mizuki chuckled and finally read it properly. “To add to the shrine scrolls, one must head the word of the scroll’s creator. However, I recognize that whoever may read this may not know this person’s location. That is why I have passed the information on to the family of the creator, each new branch learning off the location….”“Does this story end?” Anna said, tapping her tail. Mizuki quickly scanned the rest, reaching a chart of the names of the bearers of the scroll. “Hey, Nabu is on this list….”“Does that mean we go to her?” Anna asked.“It seems so. But would harvest season end if I leave this place?”“It will just take a bit longer to fully realize itself,” Anna said. “It is nature after all. It can do fair without the active support of a yokai.”“You have a holstaur?” Nabu said, arranging her new records onto one of the shelves. Marsaw hooted behind her, carrying books of the unsorted papers for Hakutaku. “A moo? That is just the layman way of saying holstaur.”“Hoot,” Marsaw said, picking up a paper with her mouth and holding it out for Nabu to snag.“You wish to request permission for her to stay? In the library?” Nabu seemed shocked; the Owl Mage wasn’t one to allow anyone other than Yokai to exist on premises, much less invite someone. “Are you feeling well Marsaw?”“Hoot.” Marsaw’s eyebrows furrowed. “Hoot, hoooo.”“I apologize, it just feels uncharacteristic of you to harbor another being.”“Hoo hoo!”“Well, researching that being does feel more in line with your disposition.” Marsaw glared and dropped the pile of papers to the ground, flying off frustrated. “Hoot hoo. Hoot!”“Please do come back when you’re calm, there is no one else to keep the papers organized with me…” Nabu sighed and picked up a few papers, putting them one by one into the shelves. She heard the sounds of fire being shot out, and then two large presences hitting the floor. “That wouldn’t happen to be the new lamias, would they?”“They would!” Mizuki said, peeking around the library row. “Hey, Nabu!”“Hi. What a pleasant surprise. Was the forestry hard to navigate? There are a lot of tall and significant trees, so it is particularly difficult to fly.”“Oh, it was nothing!” Mizuki responded carefreely.“I really enjoyed brushing around bushes,” Anna said sarcastically. “We came on a journey to add an addition to the scrolls in our basement storage.”Nabu stopped what she was doing and turned her head, her sorting arm frozen mid-air with a book in hand. “You wish to lengthen a scroll? But it’s only so recent, late generations rarely come across something prolific this early. What is it that you found?”“If you prolong using your powers to ripen plants, the fruit will disintegrate,” Mizuki said excited. “Isn’t that fascinating?”“What? That doesn’t sound like ripening, that sounds more like rotting,” said Nabu. She took off her hat, an apple that had been hidden under their falling off her head and into her hand. “Here, give me your hand.” Mizuki held out her claw, Nabu placing the apple square in the center of her palm. The Ryu started ripening the apple-like last time, watching it grow and turn redder until the fruit finally gave, lost its saturated red, and collapsed in on itself as a pile of mush and dust. “Ah,” Nabu said surprised. “That doesn’t happen when rotting fruit on purpose…”“No it does not. Does this mean that we get to add it?” Nabu pulled her hand back and went back to her filing. “I don’t know…it appears too much of a small detail to add to a scroll.”“It is still a detail!” Anna yelled, catching a glare from Nabu. “I mean, with due respect…”“Mmhmm. Mizuki dear, adding knowledge isn’t as simple as you think. You would have to track down your maker of scrolls, and undergo an arduous trial to get the page you desire.”“What of the papers you are sorting?” She asked as Nabu put another one into the bookshelf. “These manuscripts will not work. You need something made that comes from the will of nature itself, and the lands only permit the scroll makers to have such a privilege. Marsaw!” The Owl Mage flew by above, dropping a folded map in front of Mizuki and Anna. “Hoo!”“No distasteful language in front of the guests Marsaw, what were Amaterasu think of that?” Marsaw ignored her and flew off, disappearing to some other part of the library.“What did she say?” Anna asked.“Nothing, Marsaw is just in a err...spiteful mood.”Mizuki and Anna looked at it each confused. “Alright then….well, thank you for this map to the scroll maker.”“I am always here to facilitate records,” Nabu said, looking to the side to see the two leaving. “And it is ‘Maker of the Scrolls’! The title is very important to hold proper!”Mizuki and Anna traveled according to the map, staying on foot, so they didn’t miss any important paths on the way. Anna, tired of pushing aside bushes and branches, decided to burn her way clear, leading the travel duo as she shot a cone of fire out in front of them. “Wouldn’t Nabu be upset that you are harming the forest?” Mizuki asked.“I have fire abilities, it is practically my job to burn overgrown weeds of a forest. What will she do, book me to death?” Anna said boldly. Truth be told, she feared Nabu’s aura, but any leeway shown to Mizuki could be disastrous. She pushed her angst behind a cone of white fire, setting trees and an unfortunate small fauna to a quick and blazing death. “She would have to first catch up.”“She might have time to do that,” Mizuki said, pointing to a symbol on the map. It looked like a spirit, surrounded by a zodiac of various characters. “I think this is our first trial.”“Whatever it is, do I have the authority to kill it? It is the most effective way.” Anna said, burning one last patch before stopping at a bridge.“I don’t think fire on a bridge is the best idea,” Mizuki said, folding up the map and storing it away. “If we want to get to the maker of scrolls, we must get past this trial the right way. Also, we could fall down into whatever is there.”“So a river?” Anna said as she came up to the bridge. She peeked over to the side, seeing that she wasn’t wrong. Only that her guess, was several stories down into a chasm, and rushing like rapids. Mizuki came over and peeked over as well, silently wincing at the drop below. “Well, it is a river…”“A river Indeed!” Hearing speech in bold print, the two turned their eyes up to the spirit on the river, a pink and watery humanoid with no mouth and white eyes. She had a tail for a lower limb much like Mizuki, slithering around fearlessly on the bridge. “I am ink of the maker of scrolls, and you, must be her yokai. I sense a familiar energy from within you.” It somehow spoke, maybe telepathically, and pointed her limb towards Mizuki.“Well, I am a bit of a rebirth, but I am inheriting a yokai.”“Well, if what you speak is true, then you must know of the three trials, no?” The water level started rising, as if a Dam had broken further up stream. Wind came out of seemingly nowhere, creating conditions akin to a typhoon around the wooden bridge. They both covered their eyes, leaning into the wind so they don’t end up blown over. “T-trials!?” Mizuki yelled over the wind, her hair blowing hopelessly up.“Trials! A scroll’s alteration is no light asking. To make a change to the knowledge of the elders, they must see that your change is worth enduring the trials!” The wind got stronger, picking up to hurricane levels and blowing in all different directions. Water was rushing right below the bridge now, droplets flying into Anna and Mizuki. “Come now! Cross the bridge!” “Mistress, can’t you control this storm?” Anna yelled, starting to lose her grip on the ground. She grabbed on to Mizuki, closing her eyes as river mist kept blowing into their faces. Mana started gathering in Mizuki’s hand, but continuously dissipated no matter how much she tried. “The control will not mount!” Mizuki shouted, shaking her hand in frustration. “It wouldn’t be a trial if you were allowed to cheat the difficulty!” the humanoid announced, a zodiac akin to the one on the map surrounding Mizuki. “You must cross through sheer will; only then can you continue with your knowledge!”“Sheer will?” Mizuki said to herself, barely able to see the bridge without losing more ground to the barrage of the wind. She furrowed her brow and got down low, hugging the ground while she started crawling over to the bridge. Anna, at first confused, did the same, getting on the ground. The wind is less, Anna thought; her head was still getting pounded, but as long as she kept herself staring towards the ground, everything else passed like knights over an undetected spy. Mistress...how did you know!?Wow, I just wanted to hug the ground, but this crawling is actually going well, Mizuki thought, pleasantly surprised digging her claws into the dirt let her come across this strategy. Even still, crossing the bridge wasn’t for the weak. It wasn’t sturdy- It was held by an assortment of rope knots and platforms, swinging freely and erratically within the wind. My some miraculous measure, it was still holding together by the time Mizuki put a claw on the first wooden plank. She worked hard to catch each one, sliding her body across the bridge. Anna settled for holding onto Mizuki’s tail, unable to grab anything with golden scales getting on the way.“This, feels, so, uncomfortable!” Mizuki yelled, worrying about her skin getting splinters from sliding against the wood. Her form was certainly above such a mortal wound, but it still hurt like hell when her kimono left her forearms unguarded. Their weight prevented the bridge from rag dolling around, but it still swayed like an amusement park ride, making Mizuki feel Nauseous as the world twisted and spun before her.“What is wrong Ryu? Tis is only the first trial!” As if it wasn’t worse enough, the bridge finally started groaning. Mizuki could hear the cracks in the wood and strings in the rope start to fray. Avoiding the distortion would leave a worse fate to look forward too, and she would only be dragging Anna with her.She started pulling herself faster, literally clawing her way past the halfway point of the bridge. More rope started fraying, a wooden panel somewhere under her tail being the first to fall out from under her. She couldn’t hear anything; only feel a lack of wood as the storm overshadowed any splash into the raging river.“Mistress! Are you on land yet?” Anna yelled, blind to the progress of her superior. The rain completely nullified her powers, snuffing her white flames through the brute force of nature.“All….Almost!” The Ryu only had a few planks left to pull herself over. Her arms were burning, close to failure; she decided to leap for it, holding on to the ropes while she stood up in the wind. From a more standing position, she could see how close the bridge was to being ripped away from the land, as the stakes in the ground were holding on by a thread.“Nnnn!” She grunted as she jumped in the face of the wind. It went as well as trying to move a brick wall, the wind sliding her back as soon as her torso hit the grass. Her claws dug in as much as they could, each 1-inch-wide fang dragging the earth with them, until Mizuki had rooted themselves. She opened her eyes, seeing the pink humanoid above her, folding her arms while the hurricane continued wreaking havoc over them. “I did it! I crossed the bridge, please stop this!” Not a word came from the pink entity, but the bridge did the talking for it; it completely broke, Anna swearing like a sailor as she was suddenly in a free-fall into the ravine. The maiden held on to Mizuki’s tail for dear life, swinging into the face of the cliff as soon as Mizuki’s tail went taunt.“Anna!” Mizuki screamed, struggling to hang on for the both of them, much less pull themselves up. For all the power she had at her disposal, not once did she ever train her lats or biceps. Her physical prowess can only be enhanced so much by her mana and monster girl form; it took all she had to hold them against the cliff, with one falter meaning getting washed away downstream.“You’re too heavy Anna!” Mizuki said. “And so am I! I can’t pull us up!”“You must!” Anna yelled back. “Or else we will never be able to meet the scrollmaker!”“Maker of Scrolls, it’s Maker of Scrolls!” The humanoid spirit said irritated, lightning striking right next to them on the rocky face. They screamed, getting too close to being shocked. “And if you are just going to stay stuck here, then we have no business here.” “No wait!” Mizuki called out, but she could feel its presence moving away. “No, please help us up!”
  “To think you wanted to add a vital piece of information…no need, I’m sure the water will enjoy it much more. It obviously craves it more than you do.” 
“Grrr, why must our tails weigh so much!?” Mizuki tried pulling herself up again, but her arms were always too tired. “If only we were still human, we weigh too much!”“Human...human! Mistress, there is a scroll on transformation!” Anna yelled. “Maybe the change will reduce our mass!”“I...I can’t! I didn’t read that scroll!”Anna was taken aback. “What!?”“I didn’t want to change back to a human, I thought it was lame!” Mizuki said. “I’m sorry!”“Mistress it is imperative that you read! Keep hanging on!” Anna pressed her hand into the wall, the rain sizzling off and the area of rock liquifying. She kept pressing in, not stopping until she had melted a handhold for herself. There, she held on to it and started her transformation, her body shrinking until she was a short human once more. From there, she started going up the tail, making more handholds with her hands before leaping onto the end of her kimono.“Eeeei!” The Ryu said, her claws sliding back a tad bit more from the sudden jump. “Careful!”“I will be careful when read properly!” Anna stated. “I should have confirmed that you have internalized each lesson instead of taking your word, and I take blame for that.” Anna scaled up Mizuki in the storm, pulling herself up her Mistress’s kimono with only her hands. “As your Maiden, it is my duty to clean up the messes you make, and that is exactly what I intend to do!” She heard Mizuki shriek again as she grabbed the top of her kimono, which only came up to her boobs. “Anna!”“There are no footholds, unless you are willing to do more than hang like a mortal without climbing gear!” She yanked herself up to shoulder height, wrapping her arms around Mizuki’s neck. Looking down, she felt nauseous, more vulnerable to the elements now that she was human.“A-Anna…” Mizuki begged, choking from her neck holding Anna. “I-Is sorry…”“This isn’t punishment, just a few more steps…” With a couple tries, Anna lifted her leg up onto Mizuki’s shoulder, switching from neck to the top of her head to stand on her shoulders. She could finally see land, but Mizuki’s claws were ridiculously close to slipping and falling away. She hopped onto land and quickly reverted, wrapping her tail around a tree trunk grabbing Mizuki’s hand. Mizuki switched holds, now being supported by the tree and Anna rather than just her fingers. Anna started reeling her in, twisting along the tree while Mizuki finally got on the grass.“Ahhh….” Mizuki sighed as she pulled the rest of her tail up herself, rolling onto her back. Her arms were completely dead, but at least the storm was yielding now that they were on the other side. “Thank you Anna-ow!” Anna started yanking on her ear fin quite harshly.“You are a donkey! We could have fallen! This wouldn’t have been so hard if you have just read!”“I thought you hated being human since you were short! Ow, ow I relent I beg...”“Hmph.” Anna let go and sat up, looking at the pink spirit. “Hey, we beat your fucking suicide bridge. Can we pass now?”“Very well. If anything, at least the Yokai has a proper maiden. Could use a bar of soap in the mouth or two.” The spirit dissipated, leaving the path behind them for them to continue on. So they continued on traveling, headed to the next symbol on the map. “It appears there is only one more point on this map,” Mizuki said, holding it sideways to check from another angle. “Just the bridge, and now the Maker of Scrolls. Isn’t that swell?” Anna only shrugged, sticking to burning their path ahead of them.“Are you still wet? I am sure I removed most of the water off of us. Just a quick snap and we were completely dry.”“Great,” Anna said, spying a bug and snatching it out of the air to smolder in her palm. They walked in silence some more, Mizuki trying to think of what to say to break the tension between them. “Anna, I’m, did I ever apologize?”“Yes, while I was starving you of air.”“Well, I want to thank you, for everything.” Anna stopped burning a path, turning around to Mizuki. “Everything, as in?”“You know, being my maiden and ensuring that, I am doing my best.”“Well then, I must be doing a terrible job.” Anna turned back around and resumed her traveling.“Anna-”“A simple apology isn’t going to make up for this, Mizuki!” Anna said snapping, facing Mizuki once more. “We could have died there, or at the very least suffer a very humiliating swim home. Do you understand that? That if we weren't yokai we could have been killed? If you really want to make it up, just read the scrolls and don’t be so lazy and informal!”“...Alright, I’ll do that. I’ll read everything tonight, re-read them from front to back, and practice.” Anna scoffed at Mizuki’s claim and went back to clearing their path. “I’ll believe you when I see it. Mistress, how far must we go?”“Just an inch away from where we are....”“Describe the landscape.”“Well, it seems to be on a hill,” Mizuki said, looking at the rings around the symbol. “And surrounded by a bunch of trees.”“Everything is surrounded by a bunch of trees here.” Anna sighed and started flying up, keeping Mizuki visible below her while she looked around for any particular hills around them. She spied cobblestone off in the distance, on what looked like it could be a hill.“Did you find it yet?” Mizuki asked, shouting up to Anna.“No thanks to you,” she said coming back down. “Our best choice is to go a bit left.”“So it matches up with the map then,” Mizuki continued on, a bit of pep in her step-(or tail, idk how to describe slithering around, like do you say it like she a snake or like, where’s the balance in vocabulary?)-while they walked along the path. When the path split ahead, they veered left, their choice proving to be right when they came across a cobblestone build. It was covered in moss and taken over by plants growing between the rocky cracks. “Maybe she hasn’t been reborn yet?” Mizuki thought out loud, being reminded of her shrine before her training started. “Impossible, we already came across the spirit.” Anna touched the wall, feeling it for any secret switches that could pop up. “Surely it’s a trick to ward off onlookers from thinking there is anything valuable in there.”“Or anyone valuable,” The spirit said as it came out through the wall, scaring the nature out of both of them. “Our...or my powers are tied to the powers of the Harvest deity. Without them, we had to resort to unsightly methods to ward off intruders.”“Sorry about that,” Mizuki said.“It is fine, the lapses between power is routine,” the humanoid said. “However, I still cannot let you through. The gods may have let you choose the correct path, but there is one last trial to undergo.”“Yes, the gods…” Mizuki nervously laughed, before being elbowed quiet by her Maiden. “Oof!”“What is the trial,” Anna asked plainly.“Ah, well it is a simple puzzle. Wouldn’t have anything too drastic indoors. It isn’t easy to clean up after storms…” the spirit led them inside, taking them down an increasingly dark corridor. “Maiden, light if you will.” Anna’s fingers started glowing, shining bright enough to see around them. “That will do. Now then, if you don’t mind I will go back to my trial tone now. I must be authentic or else the tests will be void.”“Oh, I don’t mind,” Mizuki said. “I actually like it, helps establish the atmosphere.”“Fair enough….ahem...now then Shrine Deity, shrine maiden, your next trails shall be held in solitude!” A pink dividing line shot up between Mizuki and Anna, crashing into the wall to completely cut off the two from each other. “What!?” they both yelled, banging against the divide to try to brute force it down.“You can’t do this!”“What’s your motive!?”“I must know who really wants to have the scroll revised, that is all.” the spirit said. “No use getting through. My power is tied to the Ryu’s power. Anything she does will be met with equal guard!” Anna took offense to this, unleashing a blast of white flame onto the pink divide. “You thought I would forget about you? A maiden cannot overpower her superior.”“That is ridiculous!” Anna claimed. Her blast got larger and brighter, the backwash of the flames filling the hall with white and blue embers. She gave until she exhausted her mana, her chest heaving as if she just finished a marathon.“If you’re done with your excursion, that time and energy would be better spent doing your trial.” From then on, the spirit split into two different bodies - one for each side of the divide. “This way Anna,” the one on the Shirohebi’s half led her back towards the entrance, while the other grabbed Mizuki’s arm. “You, are coming with I.” Anna’s path took her out of the crypt and above it, going up the hill the cobblestone was built into. She was brought to a circle of stones and sat down in the middle of the circle. “Do you know what this is?”“No, is this a ritual that I must perform?”
  “No. It is a trust exercise, per se.”
“Why would the last trial be a trust exercise?” Anna asked. “Wouldn’t I need Mizuki to be here with me?”“No need for that. If you two were together, then it wouldn’t be a worthy final trial…” The stone formation started to glow around Anna, its energy pouring into a large dome that surrounded the both of them. “There is only one right way for the both of you to succeed…”“And if you don’t, the consequences could be dire,” the spirit said to Mizuki. She had taken her right under Anna, deep underground into the cavern. A similar setup was in place with Mizuki also in a ring. She gasped at the ‘dire’ wondering what punishment she might have. “I wouldn’t want anyone to die or get hurt..”“Glad we are in agreement then,” The spirit said, floating to the top of the room they were in. “There is a point in this roof that leads to the outside. You can use it to control the weather on the surface.”“Is it how you were able to?”
  “No, but it is a nice guess. All I want you to do, is cause a continuous lightning strike to hit the ground above us.” 
“Oh, that is simple!” Mizuki seemed surprised that this would be the last trial. She raised her hand and closed her eyes, concentrating her control on the roof above her. Anna made sure that she had a bit of practice in precision, so managing a lightning strike shouldn’t be too hard for her, she thought…“What!?” Anna exclaimed. “You asked her to harm me!?”“No, I asked her to strike the area with lightning,” the spirit said. “I know you don’t trust her. You think she is unable to sense you, no?” it floated around Anna, Anna turning her head from where she sat. “That she would end up injuring you, maybe even killing you with her lack of discipline.” “What would you know,” Anna shot back.
  “I wasn’t born yesterday. I hear you berating her. Talking down to your own deity, have you no shame?” 
“She didn’t read a scroll because she thought it wouldn’t be fashionable," Anna argued. You wouldn’t say anything about that?”“If I had a superior, I wouldn’t! You are only a maiden Anna, and maidens don’t berate the ones they serve,” she said with a glare, staring into Anna’s angry gaze. “Even if it kills them. That is the level of trust you must have in Mizuki, and the amount needed to reach my physical form.” “So to summarize, this last trial is nothing but punishment. I see…” Anna got up and started walking towards the edge of the dome.
  “Where are you going?” 
“I don’t need to listen to your nonsense anymore. Like I’m one to play someone else’s games…” Anna started looking around for a way to get out, digging her tail in to see if she could go under. The storm started forming while she searched, a mass of spiraling clouds darkening over her. “Maybe it doesn’t extend below…”
  “This could be your last chance to pass, Mizuki can easiest sense you when you’re still.”
“Kiss my white-scaled ass.”“Your choice, if you choose to suffer.” The spirit ended her last note eerily, looking up at the sky as Mizuki’s storm grew to higher proportions. It rumbled a few times before the show started, lightning striking around the area. Back down underground, Mizuki was doing her best to bring the strikes dead center. “This would be so much faster if I didn’t have to control it all through a peephole.”“All for the sake of the trial. If you’re able to bring enough down here, you can use the power to open the gate over there.” Mizuki looked toward where she was pointing, seeing a metal gate blocking a pathway. “All the yokai before you have been able to do it, it just takes some focus.” Mizuki nodded and continued on trying, visualizing its path down the soil and rock to crash into the gate. Anna was able to see it through the corner of her eye as she dug, starting to feel the hair on her head stand and bend from the static in the air.“There!” Anna said, finally finishing her plan. She had dug a hole into the edge of the dome and was ready to tunnel her way from the dome. She turned around to the spirit, holding her hands up and ready to chop the ground. “And you said there was only one way.”
  “Whatever you try, it is going to be the last thing you ever do.”
“I do my last thing when I decide so! Not when a yokai tells me to.” Anna lit her hands on fire and started striking the ground, turning her arms into jackhammers as she burned the snow out of the way. Her head quickly disappeared below the line of lingering fire, the white flames not ending until a flash of lightning finally fell on its target. It made a beeline for the corner, a branch forming off towards Anna’s body while on its trip underground.“I heard a scream,” Mizuki said, sensing that she hit something on accident. “Maybe I should stop…” she said worryingly, but the spirit grabbed her arms, keeping them up and still before she could stop her conjuring. “If you stop, you fail the trial. A ‘deer’ must have been over the hole. It just needs to learn to stay still.” “But the deer could die!”“Not if you bend the lightning around it. You summoned the lighting, just move it.” As if Mizuki was sure to already know how, the spirit dismissed the problem as if it was a minor inconvenience. “I wouldn’t leave the lightning going through it though. A charred corpse would slow the flow enough for the gate to stay closed.” Mizuki did her best to avoid any bodies, but each time she pulled the flow somewhere else, the deer would seem to move as well. “This is impossible! Come on deer…” Mizuki said, hoping whatever animal was up there would come to its senses. “Anna was right...I wish I listened to her more…”That animal would not stop moving, even with all the energy running through it. At least, it refused to.“Arr!” Anna groaned as another lightning strike hit her back. She had long abandoned digging, but even then, she wouldn’t sit still. Every spike in the current seemed to follow her now, coming into the dome and making a bee-line for her body. “Call off the trial, this is, arggg!” Another one hit her tail, leaving her with a smoky sensation, more smoky than usual…“I tried to warn you. But then not only you refuse to heed simple instruction, but then you dive into your rebellion and insult a Maker of Scrolls! Frankly, you deserve everything coming to you.” The spirit folded its arms, looking down at Anna with the gaze of an annoyed teacher. Anna didn’t respond, staring down at the ground with gritted teeth. Each time the pain relinquished, she kept moving away only for the shocks to lock back onto her. Despite her actions, there was a small part of her that wanted to stay still. Everything else though...everything else saw trust as suicide.“Your right,” Anna said, keeping her voice down so the spirit wouldn’t actually hear her admission. “I hate this, but I can’t trust her. She just...feels too playful and-ow-too carefree. She doesn’t take her job as seriously, and I follow my tasks with too much urgency.” She looked up at the lightning, the pain starting to numb against her. “I demanded too much from her. It wouldn’t hurt for her to read all the fucking scrolls...but if I somehow don’t die, then I suppose…” She closed her eyes and laid on the ground, waiting for the lightning to finish its job. She expected her consciousness to fade along with the pain, but for some reason, her eyes were able to open.“In the sun god’s name, why am I alive?” she asked herself, starting to move but stopping; not because she finally had trust, but because her yokai form was too drained to move. She looked on to the center of the dome, where a constant flow of lightning was being routed straight into the ground.“I would say to stay still, but now you’re physically incapable of moving,” the spirit said, coming into Anna’s line of view. “Your deity just needed to bring the lightning on the right path, without hitting you of course. That was the trial.” “Fuck….you…” Anna could swear she saw the spirit smile on her mouthless face. “Still so disobedient to the end. It is a wonder that Mizuki likes you. Well then, let me take you down to her…” the spirit reached out a hand, only for Anna to slap it away.
  “Now Anna...”
“You think….I need someone like you...to get down?” Anna said, pushing herself up onto her ass. Her body started shrinking down to her human form. She got up on wobbly legs, brushing the burnt particles and grass off her dress while she got her footing.
  “Yes, only I know the way to meet up with your deity.” 
“I...I have a better one.”
  “With that body?”
“Yes, as you see, I found out something earlier, while I was pulling hundreds of pounds of dragon up a cliff.” Anna got into a wide stance and took a deep breath, then yelled like a banshee as an aura of white flame engulfed her human body. “Being a human uses less mana!”“Amusing parlor trick, but what are you going to…” Anna ignored her, going to the lightning and raising a palm to strike the ground next to it. It lit on fire, despite her being a human. “What...what are you doing...stop, stop that!” The spirit quickly put two and two together, but by then, it was too late to stop a new route from being made.“I’m so proud of myself!” Mizuki said, standing before the open gates. Blue lightning pulsed through the gates' veins, keeping it open wide. “I even managed to save the deer as well! How’s that for passing a trial spirit? Spirit of scrolls?” She looked at the wide-eyed humanoid staring up at the ceiling, where the lightning shot in only to go towards the gates. All of a sudden, the second spirit flew in, immediately fusing with the one with Mizuki.“Spirit?” She still got no answer, but the ceiling collapsing around the lightning stream was a pretty good replacement answer. The cascade pilled over the formation on the ground, a few bits and pieces getting vaporized in the lightning. Finally, Anna fell down after, shooting fire at the pile to slow her fall before sliding down the mass of rubble. “Anna!” Mizuki rushed her and hugged her Maiden, getting a few nuzzles in while the human was too small to deflect her cheek away. “Not too hard, you will break my bones!”“Oh, hehe. You were just gone for so long, I’m glad you’re safe now though...and a bit..burnt.” Mizuki noted the ruined, slightly oversized Kimono on Anna. “Was your trial alright?”“More than alright, I could handle it all and then some!” Mizuki chuckled again. “Sure, sure you did.”“If you two are done, I have a, erm, physical form that needs revealing,” the humanoid shouted, floating into the gates. It still seemed offed by Anna’s grand entrance but didn’t say anything about it yet. Mizuki started following, but Anna jumped up and tapped her shoulder.“Oh, yes Anna?”“I….I wanted to apologize for earlier. I shouldn’t have yelled at you for not reading the scrolls. It is your choice how you decide to use your time, and as your Maiden, I should respect that decision. From now on, I won’t question you.” Mizuki put her hands on her hip, getting a chuckle out of Anna’s apology.“Is my realization funny to you Mistress,” Anna asked, feeling a mix of disappointment and anger from her reaction.“No no, it is that, I prefer your questioning. I was trying to route the lightning, but it was near impossible to get it around the deer. I would have done a lot better, had I trained.”“A...deer?” Mizuki nodded her head. Anna wasn’t sure if she should clarify who the deer was, but at least she and Mizuki seemed to be on the same page. She put on a slight smile and started walking, passing her Mistress to go into the gates. “I’m glad that we have an agreement then,” she said, lighting a flame and leading the way after the spirit.The spirit took them to a little workroom, opening the door to piles on top of piles of scrolls strewn all over the place. A Ryu was in the middle of it all, scooting as much of the mess as possible around to make some space for her two guested. She had purple-blue hair and a fuchsia color on her tail. A blue lotus was pushed into her hair, bouncing lightly as the Ryu slithered around to pick up scrolls by the armful. She had slight bags under her eyes and seemed jumpy with little twitches in each movement. “Oh my, that explosion shook everything down!”“Sorry about that,” Anna said flatly. “That tends to happen with rocks falling down.”“I will not hesitate to kick you out!” she yelled, hissing at Anna while she clutched her scrolls. “I have hundreds of things I could be doing rather than entertaining a homewrecker. Like entertaining a deity.”“Well,” Mizuki said, taking an apple out from behind her dragon ears. “I have a ripening spell that has...a dire effect when overused.”“Show,” the Maker of scrolls said. Mizuki started ripening the apple, the fruit visibly getting shiner and more red until it started to rot, and then skip right to turning to dust. Mizuki looked up at the other Ryu, who stroked her chin. “Interesting...do you have the scroll?” Mizuki nodded and started patting her body, the pats slowing down as she didn’t feel anything on her body. “Oh snapples.”“We, forgot, the scroll?” Anna seemed dumbfounded at their blunder. For all that they went through, they didn’t even consider that the Maker of Scrolls would need the actual scroll. Crazy, huh?The MoS rolled her eyes and dug around, taking an empty scroll and tearing a part of the sheet off. She then bit her finger, using the drops of blood as ink to write the new addition. “Here,” she said, handing the slip to Mizuki. “As long as you touch the scroll with this page, the amendment shall be official.” She then gave Mizuki a second piece of paper, a small business card/talisman with her information on it. “Use this, so you won’t have to do any more trials.”“That was….unexpectedly quick and simple for what we went through,” Mizuki said.“I got shocked to near death for this! There has to be some sort of payoff right?” Anna complained.“Trust me, after you live long enough, you will start finding a lot more new things to bring to my attention. Seeing the entire scroll-making process is like eating candy. Sweet the first few times, but bland and routine if you do it too often.”“It could not hurt to see it once though…” Mizuki trailed off to read the business card. “..Uddona?”“....fine, you two move aside. I need space for a summoning circle,” she said, getting out of her chair and pushing scrolls aside.“Yay!”“Alright!”
  
    Chapter Text
    “I can’t believe we got a complaint for noise,” Anna said, reading along to an instructional scroll while she opened a fire-ringed portal to Nabu’s library. It was the middle of the night, but whoever was the prosecution didn’t seem to care. Mizuki leaned against the wall half asleep, drooling from her limp and hanging mouth. “Mistress.” Mizuki closed and wiped her mouth, standing up on her tail.“Yes?”“You were asleep again.”“I can’t help it, the moon is too high to be awake….” Anna sighed and finished the spell, clapping her hands as one of the shelves appeared in her ring of fire. “I understand, but I rather not incur any wrath from Nabu.”“And take care of the problem?”“That too,” Anna responded, pulling Mizuki through the portal. “But, what if it’s the same lady?”“At midnight?” Mizuki questioned as they came into the center of the hall. There were plenty of seats and tables to lounge and read, just like a real library. “She would have to be a real stickler to- oh my god it’s her!” Mizuki stopped in her tracks, seeing the familiar-looking mermaid waiting for them. A single light shone down her body, showing her kimono with wavy edges that traced around the holes for her head and torso, when up and down her shoulders and sides, and went around armholes made far too big at the end. Luckily the rest of her clothing was fitted and kept tight with a nice string-tie around a purple band portion of the kimono. Her blue, neck-length hair was wrapped up in a bun, and her turquoise eyes looked at the two yokai joining her with disdain. Especially Mizuki, giving her the evil eye twice as often as Anna. “Mizuki,” she said, her ear-fins shaking around.“Meridian!” Mizuki, despite being annoyed at the mermaid, shook her ears back at her. “We always do this when we meet!”“It isn’t on purpose! My fins just shake when I detect something that disturbs me.”“From danger or from monotony?” Anna commented off to the side.“I heard that you little-”“Girls!” Nabu called, carrying a tray with cups of water to the group. “No bickering, no need to wake up the animals.” Meridian looked away, admiring her nails while Anna and Mizuki sat down. Nabu also sat down, passing around the shot cups to everyone. “Spring water from the Mist. A shot’s worth can keep your throat moist for hours.”Meridian: EwAnna: EwMizuki: Hehe, nice.“I don’t mean for lewd purposes, we deities are above that. At least, on every day except Saturday. What you do on Saturday is not my duty to document.” Everyone took their shot, putting the cups back on the tray. “Now, what we are going to do is respectively dialogue about the issue at hand. I got this water so there would be no need to ask for a glass, or for anything else. Now, Meridian,” Nabu said, adjusting her glasses. “You requested this meeting, yes?”“Indeed. You see, I am still having issues with Mizuki’s storms overflowing into my territory.” Meridian poked the table assertively. “I have certain days when I’m not punishing the mortals on the countryside, but her rain makes them think I am just some heartless god!”“Well, are you?” Nabu asked.“I am, but I have mercy. They, ruin that!”“If I may interject,” Anna asked. “That only happened once. Every other time was from you seeing a storm that was close to your territory, and god forbid a cloud wander from our land to yours.”“Clouds are storms that haven’t formed! You both could be plotting a surprise hurricane! Or worse!”“Like your tsunamis flow inland farther than your territory?” Anna retorted.Meridian shrugged. “Nature is a rude mistress. At least I have control over my storms! Frankly, it is a surprise that you two have a power so important. You don’t seem to understand as a maiden, and a deity that is in charge of ensuring human families have food for the coming winter is SLEEPING IN FRONT OF A HIGHER COUNCIL MEMBER.” Mizuki snapped awake again, lifting her head from the table dazed. “Seriously, this is who I had to give territory to?”Nabu nodded. “Mizuki is highly productive when she’s not...sleeping.”“Or skiing, or fishing, or training. She did start training as of late,” Anna added. Meridian was in disbelief, as her coughspyingcough had left her confused about when the Ryu did her practicing.“Her? Training? What does she do Maiden?”“Whatever scroll her claws grab first. There is a better way, I’m sure, but unless we could find someone to sort them for us…”“Isn’t that your duty?” Nabu asked, arching an eyebrow.“Do you make Marsaw sort your library?” Anna asked. The air around Nabu started growing heavy as she looked down at the table without another word. “I meant that with all due respect, Nabu.” Anna quickly corrected herself before anything else happened.“Interesting,” Nabu said with dread. “I suppose that is….allowable.”“Yes, we should get back to the topic at hand.” Anna said. “About how this entire meeting is pointless?”“Yes, this meeting...deep breath...Meridian, what was the offense that you brought this time?” Nabu gave the mermaid the floor, sitting back in her seat.“Well, it is a horrific image, but I saw a cloud! Over my shore!” she acted like it was the end of the world, shaking her head at her own words. “It was almost comical, but I had to bring up the issue!”“That isn’t a problem to bring to a high council member at night, Meridian,” Nabu said coldly. “We could have been sleeping, and you could have blown the cloud away.”“But-”“If you do this again, I will personally make sure it stops. Is that clear?” Meridian wanted to push the issue, but she rather not cross Nabu in the middle of the night. “Yes, Ma’am.”“Good. Dismissed, all of you!” She waited till the three of them, then exited out of the hall to the outside. She saw Marsaw, yawning on her perch on top of the temple wall. “Hey,” she said, Marsaw straightening her pack and acting like she was alert the entire time. “Hoot!”“I need...I need you to sort the library.”“Hoo?”“Yes, I know it’s sorted! I mean…” Nabu took off her hat, holding it to her chest in a humbling manner. “Can you sort it in a new order, for me?”“Hoot….” Marsaw hopped off and flew down, seeing exhausted at the prospect of arranging books for part of the night.“Thank you, I just needed a sort of leverage for future use…” She closed back the door, bidding a good night to the forest above.Meridian had taken an escort here, a carriage pulled by her men and horses. A puddle of mud was around it from all the water that it dripped off, and her drivers were currently clearing a path that wouldn’t splash the mud anywhere. “Didn’t I tell you both to dry that thing?” She asked as a knight in blue armor carried her back to the transport.“We couldn’t help it Madam, the water  oesn’t disappear after we leave the shore waters.”“Don’t give me excuses!” Meridian said. “The moment we are above sea level, I should find my seat dry.” She took a fan out from her kimono, pointing the folded piece at the guard. “I should have you drawn for this!”“Yes Madam, sorry madam.” They hurried and cleaned off the carriage, doing the seat first so they could put the Mermaid inside. She sat and watched them rush around, removing the water with clothes and their clothing before hopping onto the driver’s seat and urging the horses forward. “Simpletons, can’t even properly maintain a carriage,” she said, holding her hand out to the third guard that carried her. He gave him a nail file, Meridian taking it without looking to tend to her keratin. “Can you believe them? And to think they complain that it’s pointless…”“It does seem pointless, madam.” Meridian looked up, pausing her nail filing. The guard looked towards the window, feeling her mertail nudge his leg. “No, continue. I would love to hear why that is pointless.”“Well,” the guard said nervously. “It does seem counterintuitive if we are not staying on top of land for long. We are wiping our transport dry, just to go back in the water where it would be wet once more madam.”“....I should have you drawn for that as well.” She continued filing. “It isn’t about function, it is about form! I can’t appear in front of a higher council member with a carriage lacking in presentation. You should understand that since you are the only one with permission to even touch me.”“Yes madam, sorry madam,” he sighed, the carriage reached the beach. They didn’t slow down as the horses trotted into the sand, making small waves with their hooves and the wheels as they went below the waterline. Their appearances changed underwater, horses turning into seahorses, and the guards getting fins on each of their limbs and more fins on their armor. The fancy carriage lost its wheels and materialized two skis-like structures in return. Her majesty was the only one who remained unchanged, her hair floating around now that she was underwater. “Guard!”“Yes madam,” he said, swimming beside her to tie her hair into a small bun.“No no no! My hair is too short for such a thing. Just use a hat, it is before dawn so there is no harm.” He nodded and lifted a part of the seat, taking a blue beret out and gently placing it on her head. “Now, what are my tasks for tomorrow?” she asked, putting her nail file away and taking out a pocket mirror.“You have your sleep until the light reaches the seafloor, then some time dedicated to answering to the locals.”“Yes, those peasants,” she said with a tired look, looking up at her hair. “You should have done this before. I can’t see if my hair is neatly under the beret like this…”“Yes madam, sorry madam,” he said, doing his best work in the limited moonlight they have. “We are going to come up to your castle soon, and then I can finish the work.”“It would be too late by the time we reached my home. I’ll just have to save face for now, go back to your seat.” He went back and sat down from across from her, looking out the window. The seahorses had brought them over Meridian’s main kingdom, a collection of towns and large gothic-style buildings lorded over by her castle. The lights went on around the castle, a long strip lighting up in her garden for her carriage to land. “By the way, will you be here tomorrow?”“No madam. I was notified by one I needed to be ‘on guard’ for another escort tomorrow. I  wanted to hear it from you, if you were the one who requested it.” Meridian looked confused, but then her memory started working. She wore a newfound glee, chuckling evilly while covering her smile with her arm. “Madam?”“Yes, Yes! Tomorrow is the day, how could I forget!”“Permission to ask for more information?” He asked as the seahorses touched down, two guards opening the door for both of them to come out. Meridian stood up, taking one of the guards hands as she headed inside. “Just be prepared. By the time I am done, you will have your very own mainland to manage for me!” Ominously, she went inside, leaving him and the two drivers outside. “I guess this is where I tell you to escort me home,” the guard inside said, worried about what plan his princess had now.“Yes Sir!” they said, the horses neighing as they took off again for his place. He motioned them to keep moving and leaped out of the carriage, swimming the rest of the way down to her home in the kingdom. He had a modest place with his Nereid wife and child; he was one of the highest guards in the castle, but in the end, he only needed enough for a toddler to move around in.“Honey!” His wife said, peeking out the window after hearing the seahorses go by. She held out her arms as the guard floated down toward her, slowly flying into her, but bumping into the window frame since he still had her armor on and everything. They both had a laugh, awkwardly hugging before he finally came inside.“So, how is my big important guard?” She said, gently closing the door as they came in into the dark. She swam over to the corner of the room, finding a small glass-encased candle to light. “You disappeared from our bed, and I got nervous….”“I’m well, now that I’m back with you,” he whispered, bringing a match from the kitchen. He put the lighting inside the glass, and slide the match against the part of the wax-covered in lighting paper. The match lit up, lighting up the candle by proximity. “I thought there was something important, but it turned out to be the usual again.”“I hate the usual,” she commented, staring at him in the dim light. “No offense, but your princess sounds like such a kobold. ”“Honorary princess, and I know…” He said. “I have no idea what her problem is with the dragon. I also don’t like standing in the library, the owl feels so creepy sometimes…” His mind drifts off to him standing guard against afar, feeling the gaze of an Owl Mage burning a hole through her armor while she also stood guard. His wife’s tail snuck on him, tickling his leg. “You’re drifting off again honey…”“I am a bit tired, that’s all.” He didn’t have a soft silky tail wrap around her leg, but he at least had hands he could grab her hands with. “How’s our daughter?”“Sleeping, at least I think. You know how much she misses you sometimes.”“If we round the corner, do you think she’ll be awake?” He asked. They both looked towards the hallway, seeing small fins poke out from her hiding place.“I doubt it because she’s SUCH A GOOD SLEEPER!” She yelled. Their daughter screamed and fell next to the candlelight, immediately getting up and rushing back into bed as if they didn’t see her. “She falls for it every time, it’s so cute.”“I suppose we have to get back to our bed too,” He said, picking up his wife.“Ah! So strong.”“It is a lot easier underwater, trust me.” He said, taking her with him to sleep the rest of the night.“Is that the last of them?” Meridian asked, tapping on the armrest of her throne bored. Her personal guard from before was beside her, scanning the room for anyone else that had requests to consult the queen. “I do not see anyone else coming into the room, madam.”“Finally! That last one was the most frivolous land dispute I had ever heard. That lady was being so annoying.”“Yes madam?”“Indeed!” The water around the mermaid started swirling, affected by her irritation. “Apparently some innocent farmer came and moved in, and now she is upset about having to share land! It’s just a fellow farmer, can’t they just get along and not bother me with their squabbling?”“That is mental.”“Isn’t it? And now she has the gull to claim that her land is being invaded by a few weeds from her new neighbor’s place. Frankly, I hate having to hear that over and over.”“Permission to point out the similarities between her and someone I know?” Meridian flicked him with her tail, sending him tumbling away in the water. “I should have you drawn for that….”“Yes madam, sorry madam,” he said, stopping his spin and grabbing his spear.“I have my reasons you know. Our dispute is much more than a few weeds on a farm. It has a purpose!” Meridian puffed her chest out on her seat. “I wouldn’t raise concern if it was just a deer that happens to cross into my land, but it’s much more than that, and that lizard doesn’t take it seriously!”“Permission to ask question?”“Granted.”“Is this why we are going to frame the Ryu?”Meridian scoffed, putting her hand over her chest. “Frame is such a dirty word. We are just going to, water out the dirty laundry at the next meeting. Yes…”“Permission to ask about phrasing madam?” The mermaid shrugged and waved him on. “I hear the saying is actually ‘air’, but we are under the ocean.""It simply is below me to commit such a geological mistake. Now, where is that plan I told you to hold on your person?” He lifted his helmet, the paper floating above his head before he snagged it and started reading. “Our first step is to...scout? Madam, you said scouting was a responsibility for the peons.”“What?” Meridian asked smiling. “Are you saying you see yourself as above it?”“No, why are you scouting with me?” He asked, reading the paper again to make sure he had gotten it right. Not once had he seen madam do anything remotely related to a soldier’s job...or anything involving standing up.“Because,” Meridian said. “As much as I hate mucking about, those scags could refute my evidence in front of Nabu. However, if it is caught by my own hands…” she started, rubbing her hands together. “....muhahahah! Then it can’t possibly be a lie!”So they traveled by foot, which was more of the guard carrying Meridian for a long trek into the forest. She hung on to his neck, being held snug in his arms while he went up one of the many rollings hills inland. “Hurry guard! We must arrive before the meeting starts.”“We couldn’t….we….take the carriage...at least partway…..” he had to constantly adjust his grip since her tail constantly slipped around in his hands. On top of it, she moved around from his touch, and sometimes slapped his faceplate when he shifted around too much. “Keep your hands still!”“I’m trying madam, but you’re…”“I’m what,” she asked, staring into his eyes while his legs wobbled.“N-nothing madam….I will keep walking madam.” He struggled, but it got easier to hold her once the sun finished drying both of them off. The slightly-muddied ground was now dry and packed without water constantly leaking out of his armor, and he could comfortably suffer until they reached the uninhabited forest.“Is this the right forest?” he asked, confused as to why there were the sounds of animals coming from the inside. “Wildlife is inside.”“It’s the mana, idiot. Now that the Ryu is there, the forest life must have rebounded. Well, onward!” He groaned and continued on, carrying her all the way to their shrine. He stopped behind a large shrub, where he took off his cape and put it down, so he could lower Meridian, then full-on fell onto the ground himself.“You do realize by doing that, you are making me feel like I am heavy.”“My apologies...madam,” he responded out of breath.Meridian sighed and peeked towards the shrine, seeing Anna call at Mizuki from the front doors. “Mistress, we must go to this meeting!” A faint Mizuki could be heard, but not even her yokai ears were that good at hearing. “Do you have your pad and quill?” Meridian whispered to her guard. He nodded and took one from under his helmet. “Good. Only your legs should be tired, so stop moping and start transcribing.” He nodded, visibly red in his face from the blood pumping while he tuned into Anna.“I know you are not ready, but….”“N-no! Mistress, the scroll said it was important, not impotent!”“W-no, you must be there to get the information…”“Are you getting it?” Meridian turned away from watching, looking at her tired human. “Well, are you!?”“Yes madam, I am transcribing madam….” she nodded and turned back to the action, watching through the small leaves like a writer watching an opera they inspired.“Fine then! Since you wish to be difficult….”“Yes, I am going without my mistress. I hope whatever sleep you are getting is worth more than this meeting!” Anna warned, heading off.“Yes!” Meridian cheered from behind the shrub, punching the leaves in celebration. “Yes yes yes!”“I have written everything,” the guard mentioned, placing the pad on his chest while he closed his eyes for a rest. She swiped it, scanning the lines for each of Anna’s words. “Excellent!” she exclaimed, the sinister word rolling off her tongue.“Now, off to the meeting!” She said, scooting herself onto her guard’s stomach. He wheezed, too tired to get up with her own him. “Fine, when a carriage gets here. Seriously, what guard can’t walk here from our kingdom?”“None of them, madam…”“Bollocks, I’ll have a test once we bust this sleeping failure of a deity.”Ganan was the first one at the meeting, greeting Nabu as she entered the stage. “Nabu….you’re late.”“And you’re early. Dancing class didn’t go on for long?” she asked her. “You’re headband is still on, by the way.”“I escaped rhythmic training. Otomi may think I need it, but I don’t see myself needing something like that to control the sun.”“Mmm….” Nabu placed her things on the table and sat down beside them, watching Ganan pace around. Ganan kept on moving, reciting her speech under her breath while occasionally looking at the Hakutaku. “You’re not talking.”“I didn’t receive enough sleep last night,” Nabu said. “I’m not going to do much more than what is needed today.”“I see…” Ganan went back to pacing around. She was expecting something else from Nabu, but she really did go silent. “Do you...wish to talk about it?” Nabu shook her head. “Ah, of course, this is a dumb conversation...unless.”“Does my voice help you focus?” Nabu asked, organizing her things.“I’m used to doing my preparation with it in the background...” Nabu smiled, Ganan looking away before she could lock eyes with her. “What?”“Fine then, I’ll try to ramble on for your ears…” The doors flew open, grabbing Nabu and Ganan’s attention as Meridian came in, carried by her guard.“This is wrong, the mermaid doesn’t come this early…” Ganan muttered.“Meridian, what are you doing here?” Nabu asked. “Don’t tell me…”“No no! I assure you, have the proof now! Guard, take me down to her, it’s tiring for my voice to carry this far.”“Yes madam.” He traversed down the steps, placing the mermaid in the front row before stepping aside.“Now Meridian…” Nabu said, tiredly turning to her. “We’ve had a discussion already. It hasn’t even been a few cycles yet.”“I understand, higher council member Nabu. Ganan, the summer deity.” Ganan stopped her pacing, nodding her head before going back to her routine. “It’s ill-advised to mention her name right now, she’s in a preparatory phase,” Nabu warned. “The last yokai that said her name, ended up shoved in a barrel…” The fire around Ganan’s legs and arms flared for a second, but she herself didn’t stop marching.“Please extend her my graces for her leniency.”“She’s only letting it go since it creates conversation for her to drown out. So this evidence...”“Guard.” the guard went up to Nabu, kneeling and holding the paper up to Nabu. “Courtesy of madam, miss!”“He’s loud,” Ganan muttered.“The fire mouse asks for a lower volume,” Nabu said while taking the paper. “So, you transcribed a conversation?”“By myself. I know you wouldn’t trust my guards to do it…” Meridian said. “There, it clearly shows that this ‘Mizuki’ clearly puts her own leisure before our orderly organization.”“Where are Mizuki’s words?” Nabu said. “I only see the Maiden talking.”“It was too far inside for us to hear, by why does it matter? She’s obviously not coming, no matter of what she said.” Nabu put her hands over her eyes, rubbing her eyebrows back and forth. “Ganan, can you believe this?”“No….but, if the Ryu isn’t doing her duties, then there’s no need for her in our association,” Ganan said. "No exceptions."“Yes!” Meridian exclaimed. “I mean, the highest power aside from Amaterasu agrees with me; I mean that with all due respect, Nabu.” The Hakutaku’s headache was growing, but Ganan’s decree went above her head. “What do you think Ganan?”“You’re not worthy to say my name!” Ganan said, her flames brightening until they nearly enveloped her body. Meridian jumped in her seat, almost shifting back. Ganan took a couple of deep breaths, letting her fire die back down to just her arms and legs before resuming her walk. “If she isn’t here by the start of the meeting, she shall be promptly removed.”“Ugh…” Nabu palmed her face, wanting to put her head through the table. She got up and went over to Ganan, poking her cheek. The rest of the flames died down quickly, going back to balls that surrounded her wrist and ankles as the Hinezumi turned to her. “Was it the wrong decree?” Ganan asked. “She did do wrong, no?”“Yes, but…” Ganan left Nabu as soon as she heard the yes, going back to her speech. Nabu turned towards Meridian, who had a sly grin hidden behind her hand.Soon, attendees started filing in one after another. The guard had gone outside to wait for the meeting to end, so it was just those three who remained while people poured in. Nabu scanned the crowd, hoping to see Mizuki coming in. Anna came in, but she was alone.“Well, well, well.” Meridian said. “The Ryu is nowhere to be found~”“Not like this…” Nabu was completely still, still looking for anywhere for Mizuki to be there. The thought that all this time, the issue could have been real had never occurred to her; at least not after the first and second time. The flow of yokai entering started tapering off to her dismay, until it was just one or two people coming in everyone once in a while.“Nabu, you, you have to introduce me,” Ganan said, moving to her side to speak to her ear. She had a stoic gaze as she looked past her head, but her whispers were hinted at panic. “I don’t do good unless you introduce me.”“Just one more minute…” she whispered back calmly. “I really don’t want to kick someone out on the account of lateness….”“I can’t excuse something like this. Amaterasu wouldn’t excuse something like this…” Ganan said. “Introduce me.” Nabu sighed and got off the table, slowly walking center stage to greet everyone. She gave one last glance at Meridian and Anna and started talking. “Thank you all for coming to our meeting. We have arranged one, important topic to cover, so we appreciate those who understand how….important your presence is. So, without further adou..”“Wait!” yelled Mizuki, coming running in through the doors. She was completely human, carrying her kimono in her hands while wearing her old villager clothing. Everyone either gasped or looked on in confusion, wondering why the golden-eyed human was at their meeting.“Mizuki?” Anna said, standing up to see her mistress better. “W-what are you doing looking in that form?”“I finally managed to do this perfectly!” She said, skipping to Anna’s row to show off her stride-filled legs. “The horns were the hardest part, but you do like it when I practice.”“You did this, for me?” Anna asked, seeing Mizuki hop down the seat levels over to her. “Of course! I wasn’t lying when I said I should train more. Do, do you like it?” She asked.“I….I do,” Anna said, hugging her. She cracked a smile, and possibly a bone or two with how hard she was hugging her. Of course, everyone clapped at the end, as this is a perfect way to end a happy ending.“Wait!” Meridian said, turning to Nabu. “Are you serious!? She is late! You started the meeting already.”“A-a-aaa. I never said it has begun. I will say it right abouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu…” she kept the word going, watching Mizuki until she finally sat down beside Anna. “...uuuuut now!”“H-heresy!” the mermaid cried.“Sorry, but she made it on time. Do you allow it Ganan?” Nabu asked and elbowed the mouse, getting a nod out of her. Nabu smiled wholeheartedly back towards Meridian, relieved on the inside. “She allows it.” Now it was Meridian who couldn’t go against Ganan’s word, even more so since she risked being turned into a seafood item. She folded her arms and sat in silence, not making any more of a fuss.“Now, with that issue out of the way, Ganan, I think it is finally time for your turn.” Ganan nodded, stopping her pacing and facing the crowd before her. “Thank you. Yokai of the YA, we have gathered here today to discuss a new problem that has cropped up. There have been rumors of a new yokai wandering around the lands. So far, there has not been any information to confirm this, but if there is any evidence that is found, please share it with your fellow yokai and the higher council…”
  
    Chapter Text
    “Frankly, I think it’s idiotic to write a story without a plan,” Seika said, her guard feeding her another chocolate-covered strawberry. The group decided the time was nigh for another picnic, this time with a case full of melted chocolate and a fountain that the Echidna was donated to by a follower. “It doesn’t matter if it is a serious tale or a manuscript a mortal writes as some sort of outlet. When you read it over, it will simply be terrible!”“Don’t get me started on the empty chapters,” Mervana said, taking an orange slice and dipping it into the chocolate. “I don’t mind one or two in a long, interesting piece of literature, but when an amateur does it is just such a turnoff.”“Or when someone tries to pass off what is filler has part of the tale,” Namaru added. She picked up an orange slice, looking at it while side-eying the chocolate fountain. “Do the humans dip oranges in chocolate?”“Am I human?” Mervana asked, her mouth full of oranges. Nabu chuckled at the orange smile, picking a cabbage for herself from the pile of food. “I don’t know sometimes. I find the attempts charming. We don’t all start out writing like Ransuer.”“I don’t like his work. He is a deity of literature, so of course it must be perfect.” Namaru said, rolling her eyes. “I rather read something my slaves have written, and they do not have minds. Pompous bitch.”“I personally like filler,” Sana said, tuning her mandolin. “It gives an opportunity for the other, lesser explored characters to be developed, and it’s a nice change of pace from seeing the main storyman.”“Of course you would like filler,” Namaru said accusingly. “You’re a lesser deity.”“What does my status have to do with anything?”“You bear less power,” Seika said, the guards stopping their feeding of fruit. “You’re less important Sana, to be blunt. If we were all characters, you would naturally be a side character.”“I am not a side character!” Sana said, angrily standing up. “I’ll have you know that I do things daily that are fit for a protagonist!” The group all ooooed, but then laughed in Sana’s face. Sana went red in embarrassment, stomping her taloned feet against the ground of the tent. “What’s so funny Nabu? Your chapter was nothing but sex with a holstaur!”“That was not me, that was my beautiful bird Marsaw,” Nabu said, dodging the claim. “And I am a recurring, universally loved guardian figure. I have a purpose in this story. What are you even doing with your chapter’s worth of spotlight?”“Well...I’m…” Sana fiddled with her instrument, trying to figure out what she would do with her five minutes of fame. It’s not every day you get a chapter all to yourself, a point of view for the reader to follow whatever you do for the whole day…“I will figure out something interesting!” Sana claimed. “I just happen to have a clear day today.” On that note, one of Seika’s guards whispered something to the lamia, getting her to laugh again and respond in her native language. The guards also laughed, leaving the tent clutching their stomachs in joy. “O deus meus! My guards just said ‘and a clear week’!” The rest of the tent erupted in laughter, all except Sana.“Hey..Hey….Hey!” She screamed at the top of her lungs, everyone stopping once more and giving her a weird look. “That is it! I am tired of everyone treating me like a little sister just because I am a lesser deity.”“But...you are,” Namaru whined, getting an elbow from Mervana. “O-oh, not out loud, sorry.”“That’s what I mean! You don’t even respect my turn to talk. I feel invisible sometimes….well that stops now!” Sana picked up her mandolin, putting its strap over her shoulder. “I’m going to go out, and I will not come back until I have a cool protagonist-like story!” Namaru laughed one last time, before getting full-on slapped by Mervana’s tail. “Ow! Hey!” Namaru said, seeing Mervana innocently taking a smoke from her pipe.“Are you serious about this Sana?” Nabu asked, taking a bite of her greens. “Because I, for one, can’t wait to see what you bring back for us to enjoy.”“Thank you, at least one person believes in me, even if it is your job to.” With that, Sana took off, leaving the tent far behind as she went in search of something cool that would make her a respectable protagonist.“Well, now that she is off on her mission,” Nabu continued. “I am interested in this conversation about filler chapters.”“Well let me tell you like this,” Seika said. “The only thing worse than a filler episode is a tomato.”“Are we still doing that gag…” Namaru said flatly, looking around after there was a bit of silence. “Hey, I feel there should have been someone agreeing with her.”“I agree with her,” Mervana said, dipping her tail into the chocolate. She took a couple of licks, before regretting it and rushing outside to spit it out.“No no,” Namaru said while Mervana was gone suffering. “Someone that does it more angrily, and is very vocal about it.”“Now that you mention it,” Seika said, looking around the tent. “We are missing a fireball. Where is Anna? And Mizuki for that matter?”“So, your newest addition to the portal scroll,” Uddona said, writing with her blood on a blank sheet. “What did you say it was again?”“Portals inflict damage if the performer’s elemental type is materialized incorrectly…” Anna said, both her and Mizuki looking burnt to a crisp. Mizuki coughed, but all that came out was a small puff of smoke. “Everything on the inside hurts…” Mizuki said, falling into her mass of tails in pain.“Mmhmm, mmhmm,” Uddona hummed like a physician, writing everything she heard and saw down. “And for accuracy, do you have any effects that are not evident towards the external eye?”“Pain,” they both said, Anna also falling into her tail coils. “Mistress, we should have just walked to the picnic today.”“Tis was a nice day today…” Mizuki said, struggling with each syllable. “My b-breathing bags…”“Lungs, Mizuki,” Uddona corrected. “Lungs.”Sana flew to her nice spot on a waterfall, strumming her mandolin while watching the water flow around her rock. “Lucky stream, all you have to do to be interesting is fall down rocks,” she said, sighing. “Then you make a crashing sound at the bottom, and spray a nice light mist everywhere….so simple, yet everyone seems to create art in your name.”“It is nice,” someone said from the side. She stopped strumming, seeing Vargas join her on the rocks at the edge of the waterfall. “Didn’t know someone would be on this rock.”“I did not know anyone knew about these rocks.” She scooted aside to make space for him, but he rejected the offer. Instead, he dropped his butt right down in the middle of the water, becoming an object in the rushing water. “The rock can only fit one person. Why don’t we sit down here?”“My feathers would be ruined…”“Oh right! But, my tails are alright.” He wiggled his extra appendages, the fur turning any water that made contact with him into steam. The wall of steam and floof kept the rest of his body from getting wet, diverting the water at angles over the falls. However, Sana’s feathers had no such ability. “I’m still fine,” she said, going back to strumming her mandolin. “So, are you also trying to figure out how to spend your day?”“My day?” Vargas asked. As he was reminded of the first half of it, he hunched over, putting his head on balled-up fists. “Oh, right. That’s why I came here, actually.”“My day is not doing too well either,” Sana started. “Do you think I am a side character?” Vargas looked at Sana, looking her golden feathers against her chestnut skin. “What is a side character?”“You know, a person with a minor role in a plot,” Sana explained. “Everyone and my mother thinks I’m one, but I know I’m destined for more. I’m interesting,” she said, trying to convince herself.“I do not know. None of us are in a plot, really.” Vargas said. “At least, mine must differ, since my whole week has been pretty poo.”“But you’re Amaterasu’s son. Any problem you gave could literally be solved like…” snap “...that.”“Not every problem. Not love problems…”“Hey…” the gears in Sana’s brain started turning, her chord strum getting faster and faster until she jumped up. “That’s it! I can help you with your love problem, and you can help me be more interesting!”“You would help a sad fox man impress his husband?” Vargas asked.“Of course! No side-character could ever be that involved in a plotline, so of course!” Sana smiled smugly, already thinking of rubbing her adventure in the face of her friends. “Let us go impress your wife!” she posed gallantly, playing one last chord as the water crashed behind her, all epicly.“Husband.” Vargas corrected. “I think you missed that part after you started playing your instrument.”“Oh sorry. Ahem... let us go impress your husband!”Vargas and Sana traveled to her home, a hollowed-out tree that was decorated with variously colored ribbons that crisscrossed each other through the branches. She flew up to her door, high up off the ground and a long climb up the bark. She pulled on the knob with her foot, shouting down to Vargas once the door was open. “Come on!”“Why couldn’t the door be...fine.” Vargas started climbing up the branches, pulling himself up until he could jump through the door. He jumped onto the main floor of her home, with one hole in the roof and one in the floor to move to a different floor. Lots of guitars were sporadically scattered around, and could be found behind every chair and object in the room. “Quite the musician,” Vargas commented, sitting down in a chair, only to find a ukulele already on the seat.“I am the deity of music after all,” she said, sitting down on the ground and placing her mandolin down. “I have no need to organize the instruments, no one important comes here….”“Ah…” Vargas looked at the hole in the floor, peering into the darkness down there. Sana came quickly and edged him away, covering the hole with her wings. “Ai, you wouldn’t want to go there! That’s where all the food goes!”“People give food for blessings?” he asked. “Music turns out to be a powerful thing to humans. Some would give an entire instrument, or neckless just to be able to sing.” Sana went inside the storage, coming up wearing a necklace with a diamond charm. “Niiice, niiice,” Vargas said. Nodding approvingly. “You look beautiful with the jewelry on.”“Thank you, I actually get all my accessories off what mortals give alone,” she said smiling. “I just wish they gave more food, I have no use for anything material.”“Maybe the mortal I’m with would!” Vargas said. “But I already tried giving him a ring…”“How did it go?”“It went poorly. He said that it was ‘too early'. Do you know what 'too early' means?” Vargas asked. Sana shook her head as well, bewildered that someone would reject jewelry. “But rings are the ultimate sign of love.”“That’s what Otomi said!” Vargas exclaimed. “So I went and spent a week forging one with the hand of a dragon, and he rejected it!”“Impossible!” Sana said. “What about publicly asking for marriage?”“That didn’t work either,” he said, sighing. “Presents, large extravagant gestures of affection, doing dangerous stunts to show my love and dedication, I tried everything! I just don’t understand humans…” He picked up the ukulele, plucking one of the cords. “What if, what if we aren’t meant to be?”Sana, determined to help him, put her wings on her shoulders. “Listen to yourself! You’re doubting your abilities and putting yourself down. You are the son of the sun god! If anyone can show a gesture of affection, it is you!”“But, what could I do?” Vargas said. “Nothing as worked….” Sana put a wing to her chin, getting one crazy idea. “I have something. It is a long shot, and unorthodox in our time, but it could work…”“So you’re saying that Di gave you infinite bullets and coffee?” Virto said, going through the bag of Lao’s ammo to organize all the bullets. Melisa sat in the corner of the room, polishing her rapier. Lao played around with Virto’s watch, seeing if it had any streaming for him to watch. “Mmhmm. Did she give you anything?”“No! All she gave me was a crazy clone that became a lilim and a metaphorical collar,” he said. “Your journey sounds cooler than mine. And more utilitarian, can you tell me what these colors are?”“It’s really simple, to be honest,” Lao said. “Yellow-bands are orderite rounds; basically purification. Red-bands are demon rounds, so the opposite and lust and what not. White-bands are explosive rounds, my personal addition,” Lao said, picking up one. “One shot of this bad boy can blow up a small car.”“So no-bands are just regular rounds?”“Yep,” Lao said, putting one regular bullet in his revolver. “Just a normal, iron bullet. Doesn’t do anything but cause a lot of pain and blood.”“Woooow….” The door to Lao’s room was knocked. Melisa got up and put on her cape, tossing her rapier back and forth in her hand.“Melisa, that could just be Add at the door.”“Even more of a reason to strike through the wood.” Melisa went up to the door, sniffing it before unlocking the lock. “It’s not Add, it smells too much like Dragonborn.”“Is she really going to stab a dragon?” Virto whispered into Lao’s ear. “Don’t worry, it won’t hurt him,” he whispered back, turning to watch. “Does your watch have a record function?”“Of course, I’m not a hack.” They both started at Melisa, watching the Dhampir get into a striking pose as she reared the blade back. Swiftly, she stabbed through the door, the pointy weapon sliding through it like butter. Unlike the usual sound of silver/metal against scale, she heard a groan, and the rapier pierced through supple skin. “Uh oh,” Melisa said, slowly pulling back her sword. It was dripping blood. “....Laaaaaooo.”“You idiot, you hit a maid!” Lao and Virto came to the door, opening it to see who was bleeding. They saw a male kitsune on the floor, being comforted by an extravagant-looking harpy. “Vargas! Don’t leave me Vargas!” Sana said shaking him around.“Never mind, it is worse than a maid,” Lao said.“Hubby!” Virto fell to the ground and rolled him on his back, grabbing his hand. “Vargas are you alright?” He nodded, lifting his hand to show a bloody hole. “It, It will heal in a few minutes…I didn’t know Geo’s security would be this intense…”“Rrrright, security.” the glass shattered behind the group, with one half-vampire missing. Lao ran to the window, seeing Melisa freerunning down to the ground to make a run for it. “Aw geez…” he turned back to Virto rubbing his back. “I have to….I’ll go get her,” he said, tossing Virto’s watch onto the bed, then grabbing his revolver and shoes in his hand before leaping out after her. Virto turned back to Vargas, unbuttoning his kimono to see if his wound was starting to heal. “I feel so bad now, this wouldn’t have happened if I wasn’t here…” Virto said, breathing a sigh of relief as the hole was closing up before his eyes.“Don’t be,” Vargas said, sitting up as Virto helped him scoot into the hallway wall. “I’ll take thousands of swords if it means I can be with you.”“I don’t want you to let yourself get stabbed over me….but it is a bit romantic I guess,” Virto admitted. “How’s the wound?”“I think what you call “blood-clotting” has finished happening,” Vargas said. “It doesn’t hurt as much now, just soreness and a bit of blood staining.”“So he will be fine?” Sana asked Virto. Virto nodded but tilted his head at the harpy before him. “Vargas, if you don’t mind introducing her…”“Oh right. Sana, this is Virto. Virto, Sana.” Vargas absent-mindedly used his bloody hand to join their arms in a handshake, only noticing after Sana’s wings had gotten a bit dirty. “Oh, I guess you could say you’re joined by blood now.”“A real blood bond I guess,” Virto said, giggling unnerved as he shook Sana’s hand. “Hey.”“Hi, but, I’m only here as support. If Vargas has healed enough to do the thing…” Sana said, winking at Vargas.“The thing?” Virto asked. “Oh dear, it isn’t another ring, is it?”“No no, I understand now that tradition isn’t your thing,” Vargas said. “Sana said that the best way for me to treat you, is to ask you what you want to do.”“....wait really?” Virto asked. He looked at Sana, who gave two thumbs up and a toothy smile. He turned back to Vargas, getting a blush on his cheeks. “Oh, wow, um...You really put me on the spot here!”“It does make sense now that I think about it. It’s no surprise, but if I know what you like, I can get you a better gift. Huh, why didn’t I think about that before…” Vargas stood up, stretching himself now that he was fully healed. “What do you like dearest?” Virto stood up, going inside to get his watch before coming back. “I have been short on metal for a while. But, to ask you to just get me a bunch of metal sheets, it’s not romantic.”“Nonsense! As long as you love it, then it’s totally romantic.” Vargas booped Virto’s nose and picked him up. “First, we and bathe, then, we go eat dinner! Then, once the moon is high, we will go mining for your minerals.”“That sounds private and intimate~” Virto booped his lover back. “I like private and intimate~”“I like it when you like it~” Vargas said, starting a kiss with Virto. Virto smooched back, holding his hands around his neck and bringing his head closer to Vargas. Like that, they slowly made their way into Lao’s room, whispering and giggling until Vargas finally fell completely onto his bed, bringing Virto with him.Sana, feeling she was no longer needed, started shuffling away. “Glad I could help!” She called to them, closing the door behind her while working her way out of the castle. When she got halfway down the hallway, Vargas’ head came through the door, calling out to Sana. “Wait! I still need your help!” he said, Sana turning around and hurrying back to him. “Really?”“Sssssh, while Virto is changing in the powder room,” Vargas said, sneaking out of the hallway. His kimono was halfway on, only wrapped around his waist as his chiseled torso and arms were exposed to the air. Virto had already seemed to get to them, with lip marks all over his pecs and abs. “I have another idea,” Vargas said, the thought of it making his blushing face turn redder. “I want to have music at our dinner, but Virto would probably hate me bringing an orchestra…”“But, I’m no symphony,” Sana said.“Exactly! A small, cute Gandharva playing your song...he would love it.”“I thought he didn’t like surprises.”“They will like this one!” They both heard the toilet being flushed, Sana hiding behind the wall while Vargas blocked the entrance with his body. “Sorry I took too long,” Virto said, coming out wearing a latex bunny suit. It had a deep V opening in the front, and semi-stiff “I couldn’t pee in the suit.”“You too just long enough~,” Vargas said, patting his head and running his hand through Virto’s green hair. “But where did you get such cute clothing from?”“I keep all my clothes in my watch,” Virto said.“Awww, I thought you wore it all under your lab coat~”“Do you want me to?” Virto looked up at Vargas smugly, holding his finger over his watch. “I can have that arranged~”“If only you knew everything I had arranged for you~”“As long as it’s not big and flamboyant.” Virto jumped up to kiss him on his cheek, drawing a purr out of Vargas before pushing him onto the bed. Vargas only had a moment before getting a face full of latex, Virto butt-smothering Vargas’s face while he undid the rest of his kimono. “Except for one hot exception, of course, ~”((Author’s note: I’ve been staring at this for two hours now trying to figure out if I should turn this into full-on Yaoi. Honestly….bleep it why not. Please skip ahead if not want, continuation should be noted by double parentheses))Virto grabbed his husband’s limp dick, licking his lips while he felt Vargas’ mouth buzz against his ass. “You probably aren’t even listening. Then again, your ears are a bit stuck, aren’t they?~” Vargas couldn’t nod or reply or anything. He had other pressing matters at hand. He grabbed Virto’s ass, fondling it through his latex. Virto turned away from the cock in front of him, seeing his husband’s fingers press into his butt. It wasn’t sign language, but that’s probably a ‘Yes’, Virto thought as he went back to his thing.He gave the cock as many licks as it took to make its outside moist and slippery. It sometimes bobbed away from him when his kitsune thrusted up, but a quick snag and it was stuck in his mouth, enraptured in his warm and salivating mouth while his ass was kneaded like dough. It turned into a contest of who could get the other to take them in a bout of lust, Vargas looking like the one to lose in the end. His hands couldn’t keep up with Virto’s mouth, his orgasm rising up and faltering each time the bunny boy let his cock feel the cold air of the bedroom.Gritting his teeth, he pressed his face into his ass, consciously having to refrain himself from sinking his entire length in Virto’s mouth while he bit down on the latex. One head pull later and he tore a hole, right over Virto’s ass, getting a muffled moan out of him when he blew on his pucker.“Mmmph” Virto blushed, feeling his ass start to get teased and tongued by his mate. With both organs out it was an equal field, and Vargas intended to abuse both as much as he could. Smirking in his head he suddenly thrusted into Virto’s mouth while at the same time spreading his boy pussy with his tongue. Virto grabbed onto Vargas’ hips for leverage, but he was quickly getting overpowered on both sides. Vargas isn’t even winning! Virto cried in his head, feeling the throbs in his penis each time Vargas paused balls deep down his throat. The thing was, he wasn’t far behind, his own member frotting against the latex clothing while his prostate got pressed and pushed like a red staples button.Virto finally caved, upping the suction inside his mouth as he creamed his clothing. Feeling His asshole spasm around his tongue, Vargas finally let go of his orgasm, his grunts muffled as he came down Virto’s mouth. Virto’s hands grabbed Vargas’s behind, squeezing his tensing asscheeks to milk more cum into his waiting mouth. Neither of them let a drop spill, Vargas’s hips and Virto’s mouth dragging every inch down his throat and keeping it stuck there until the last bit of semen was deposited inside his stomach. His throat was coated in pre and jizz, but from the clean and shiny dick that was pulled out of him, you would have never suspected a thing.“You cheater…” Virto panted, his grip slipping as Vargas lifted him up from his body. He wiped his mouth clean, getting a bird’s eye view of the rapidly re-hardening member. “Tearing my clothes like that~”“If it means I lose, then I should give you a prize right?~” Vargas dropped Virto into his lap, Virto’s cheeks under the torn latex sitting right over his cock. It drooled more and more pre onto the bed below them, letting off a horny scent that wafted up to both their noses. “I would do it regardless, for your body gives me, and my cock life~”“Just stick it inside before the smell gets stuck on Lao’s bed~,” Virto said, stealing a kiss on his hubby’s silver tongue while Vargas grabbed his member. They moaned into each other’s mouths, cock going inside backdoor, the warm innards of Virto rubbing off the hot rod piercing into his body. Vargas started thrusting, his hips rolling up into Virto’s toned derrière. Virto could feel him in his core, his heart fluttering and his member shooting pre-up his clothing with each bounce. Their love held for 5 minutes, maybe more, keeping themselves in an embrace seemed to last forever. They reached their peaks together, Virto hugging the kitsune while his insides were painted white. Vargas bit down gently on his ear, holding him tight so he wouldn’t slip away. Their mouths parted, a string of saliva dangling from their lips as they came down from their heights.“I love you so much~”“I love you, and your body so much~” Virto scooted closer to him to press his body against him, making a weird sound when he pressed his torso against him. His mouth started trembling uncomfortably, him pulling away rather quickly and scooting beside Vargas on the bed. “Is something wrong?” Vargas asked him, one ear down and another one up to symbolize his sudden confusion.“The cum...it’s still under my suit...and it cooled off…” Vargas chuckled after realizing what he meant, standing up and holding his hand to help Virto off the bed. “I suppose we really need that shower now.”“Yes please,” he said, walking like a penguin alongside his husband as they went back to Vargas’ house.
  ((Alright, if you skipped here, it’s back to normal story. Yaoi itch scratched))
After a long and hot shower, they both went back to his bedroom, Virto changing into one of Vargas’ kimonos for the special occasion. “We could always have one tailored for you,” Vargas offered, seeing how his husband’s arms didn’t even go the full way through the sleeves. “It is fine,” Virto said, brushing aside the issue. “Who’s going to see us enjoying each other anyways? It’s just going to be a nice, intimate dinner between you and me, right?”“Well, at a restaurant. I booked us a reservation.”“All the better than,” Virto said, taking Vargas beside a stool and stepping up with a comb. “I heard you also requested special entertainment?”“Nothing too large, as you like,” Vargas said, watching water droplets get flung while Virto brushed his hair straight. “I could just burn the water away, you know.”“Convenient, but it’s easier to style hair when it’s wet,” Virto said, putting down the comb. “Per se, it’s easier to get kinks out and hurts less. Lao complains about his hair all the time. “So, the entertainment.”“Only one of the best musicians I know,” Vargas said, feeling his tails getting picked up. “A work friend as well.”“I wonder where they are now,” Virto said, dropping all the tails on his lap to brush straight. “Probably also getting presentable as well…”Indeed, Sana had gone and obtained a satin red dress, One that stopped above her knees so her claws wouldn’t accidentally step on it and tear it. Her choice of an instrument; a large group of parts of a piano to put together once she got there. She flew through the dark, carrying the large assortment inside a nice burlap sack. “Vargas told me to look for a bunch of candles along a river…” Sana said, turning her head to look at the passing treeline. She saw a bunch of flame lights and dove down, slowing down so she didn’t scratch herself as she went through the trees. She dropped through the trees and landed on the ground, spitting out leaves and plucking them out of her wing. She looked around and saw a bunch of couples talking to each other, being waited on by elementals at their white-clothed tables. They didn’t seem to notice her, but Vargas saw her from across the dining place and called her over.She went around the group of tables, excusing herself each time she bumped into a waitress that was going the other way. She and her bag made their way beside Vargas and Virto, Sana waving as she finally let go of the burlap sack. “I can see why there were no instructions now,” Sana commented. “You can’t exactly say a location for this…”“I figured you would find it eventually,” Vargas said. Virto looked up from his menu, nodding and putting his head back into the brochure. “Hey Virto,” He called to him, Virto looking back up at Vargas. “I was picking our food. Do foxes mind anything vegetarian?”“The food can wait. I want to show you the surprise I was talking to you about.” Vargas plucked the menu out of Virto’s hands, motioning towards Sana. “Hi!” Sana said, waving and holding a piano key in hand.“I thought really hard, and I finally figured out something you may like,” Vargas said, pointing to the sack at Sana’s feet. “Sana is an artistic deity, and a musical savant.”“A musical savant…” Virto looked at the bag, a bit confused about its contents. “There isn’t a dead body in there right?”“No, but I am going to bring this piano to life,” She said, giving it a good old car salesman slap on the bag. “This baby could be in a million pieces, and I could still put it in working order. Just important protagonist things, amirite?” She winked to Vargas, who winked back and stifled a chuckle.“It is true, I don’t think any non-important character could assemble a piano without some help. I even know where to start.” Virto said, catching Sana’s eyes glowering as he spoke. “Wait, is this my present honey?”“Oh, Virto I would never make you do-”“Because if so….this is the best present you’ve given me!”“It is?” Sana and Vargas said simultaneously.“Of course! I absolutely love tinkering and puzzles. Almost as much as you~” Virto said, poking Vargas’s chest. Vargas blushed and adjusted his kimono, getting a giddy feeling in his chest. “You know I try my best…”“Indeed, although I don’t know why you brought us to a restaurant to do this,” Virto said, looking out towards everyone. All the other monster men and women seemed of high class, wearing jewelry and suits and fancy dress. Even Vargas had gotten a slightly nicer kimono for the occasion, and Sana looked like she was about to go onto Dancing of the Stars. He felt out of place with black dress pants and a white dress shirt, like he should have chosen a more formal attire. “So many bureaucratic eyes…” he said, feeling the gazes of others on the only human there.“Don’t worry, there isn’t anyone paying attention,” Vargas said, covering Virto’s eyes with his tail. “Does that help?”“But now I can’t see…” he said, pushing down the tail slightly. “Maybe if I start the piano the fear will fade.”“That sounds like a great idea dear.” Vargas kissed him on the forehead and lifted him out of the chair, Virto going to the bag to remove some items.“Virto, your paccheri is going to get cold,” Vargas told him, watching as the two slowly put together the piano. They had finished the frame and were arranging the strings for each key that Virto insisted be orderly before putting them on. “I have done this before, trust me!” Sana said, sighing as Virto slowly laid out every small piece. “But it would be so much faster if we order it first!”“Virtooooo,” Vargas said again, getting off the chair and lifting him up. “Aren’t you going to eat?”“But you spent so much time giving me a present…”“The food will get cold,” Vargas exclaimed. An Ignis waitress appeared beside the two, wearing a bonnet and holding a fire-retardant cloth on her arm. “Does anyone need a reheating?”“See? Hot forever,” Virto said, the Ignis moving past them. She picked up the plate with her hand, her hot body serving as a stove to reheat the food. Vargas nodded and let him go, Virto kneeling back down to arrange the pieces (much to Sana’s dismay and apprehension). “I think he likes the present a bit too much,” Vargas said, seeing someone sit down in front of him. It was a nureonago; a blue slime that had the ability to form clothes on their body with their body. This one had thick, study pads of samurai slime armor that covered everywhere but where her joints and heck were. She had no headpiece, showing her neck-length plain straight hair and her dark blue irises looking at Vargas with the sweetness of a honeybun.“That tends to happen when you give humans a new toy to play with,” she said, turning her chair around and sitting down in it backward. “Their short attention spans can’t handle it.”“You sound like my father,” Vargas said, taking another bite out of his plate. “So what brings you to a quaint and fancy place with armor on?”“Trust me, It is a bit...necessary. It is also my style,” she said. “Now, I was on the search for a fine establishment, and a fine man to dine with.”“You might have to keep searching then, but this is a nice restaurant,” Vargas said. She was walking her hand too close to him, so he used his fork to gently push it back to her side of the table. “The bubbling sprite is especially good. And soon, there would be some musical entertainment.”“How classy! I suppose there is...no way I can enjoy it with you, is there? Yokai to Yokai~”“Unfortunately not, I already have my own mate,” Vargas said, looking at his man wind the strings inside the piano. “Just look at him. He has this adorable look when his eyebrows are furrowed in concentration.~”“I suppose it is a nice pet,” The Nureonago commented.“E-excuse me?”“It is a nice pet! That’s your pet human right? A side piece, to be crude.” She tapped the table, looking bored just by watching him.“That’s my husband,” Vargas corrected.“He doesn’t seem like husband material to me. Or wife material, does he even satisfy you in bed?” Not wanting to hear it, Vargas started to get up before she could egg him on anymore. Her hand grabbed his, keeping him within arms reach before he could move away from the table. “Wait! I misspoke…”“I think I heard you pretty clearly,” Vargas said, irritated and wanting to leave. Not even his body got anything good from her, just a subtle but annoying draining feeling the longer her fingers were on his wrist...“No, you don’t understand,” she began. “I didn’t mean to be offensive. I just thought that you could...do better. The son of the sun god deserves better than a mere mortal. Someone that knows how to be a soulmate to a yokai.” He started pulling away, but was surprised and caught off guard when he couldn’t break out of her grip. She only tightened it, a harder draw feeling coming from him. He fell to his knees, his vision faltering and blurring. “What are you…”“Fufufu~” She kneeled down with him, putting her mouth next to her ear while she kept her grip. “What I mean is, you need someone you can properly...be the new child of God herself.” A shing went between the two, just barely missing Vargas as it drove in and through the nureonago’s arm. She screamed and staggered back, holding her dis-handed arm while cursing in pain. The hand fell off Vargas in a mushy clump of slime, the kitsune starting to fall onto the ground. Sana was behind him before his head could hit the ground, catching him in a feather embrace. Virto had come to his aid, standing between him and the writhing slime with a sword pointed outward. He was silently crying, tears going down his face while he stared down at her.“Oh the agony!” She cried, is slowly turning to one-armed slime. “My hand, my beautiful hand! If only there was a way to get it back…oh, wait~” Instantly, slime sprung out from her arm, quickly taking the shape of a new arm, with her sleeves forming over it. “There is!”“Step away,” Virto said, backing up to leave no distance between Vargas. Unbenounced to her, or benounced, he had been listening the entire time, keeping his head buried down in the piano.“Or what? What could you do against a Yokai?” She asked, getting into a rushing stance. “I don’t even need to use my abilities to beat you. I can just pummel you into submission!”Virto’s eye twitched once, then twice before the sword parted back into tiny nanites that went under his clothes. He got into a low stance as well, holding his hand against the side of his pants. “Ah, what technique is that human? I might have to seek it myself~”“Why don’t you come and find out…” Virto muttered, the last part becoming too quiet to be heard. She took him up on that gambit, rushing Virto ready to swipe his head off his body. He waited until she closed half the distance, and then revealed the new weapon he was growing in his pocket; A semi-automatic handgun with a stream of nanobots flowing in from his arm. He started emptying the cartilage into the rapidly approaching slime, the nanites constantly flying in to constantly form new bullets and reload the gun. The blasts drove everyone else to dive for cover, Sana dragging Vargas behind their piano.The nureonago didn’t think much of it; she was semi-fluid after all. The first bullet looked poised to just pass through her, but a sharp burning sensation stalled her confidence in her tracks. She dove away, disappearing into the trees under constant fire. “Come back and face me like a woman!” Virto finally yelled firing 2 more shots before lowering his gun. Everyone rose from behind their cover, with most of the patrons making like an omelet and scrambling away. “Vargas!” Virto yelled, finally turning away from his attack to rush back behind the piano. Vargas was laying on Sana, his eyes narrowed and closing often.“Virto…” He said, his words coming out slurred like he just woke up early in the morning. “I..feel empty…”“Don’t die on me again,” he said, choking up as he took the job of holding up from Sana. Vargas clenched his teeth and eyes, holding his hand over his stomach while Virto sat him upright. “I’m not dying, this doesn’t feel like usual…” he said. He unsteadily pointed Virto to his tails, doing his best to light them on fire. The flames barely reached their normal intensity, the fire barely rising above the fur of his tail. “My mana is gone Virto, I can’t, nnnn, get it any higher…”“Stolen?” Virto helped him up to his feet, looking back at the forest while sliding his husband’s weight to his back. Aside from probably the elementals, the place looked completely evacuated, barren with just the three of them left. That slimeball could be anywhere at this point, Virto thought, spinning around to defend himself from any oncoming attacks.“But you can’t steal mana!” Sana said, popping up with the piano packed up into the sack behind her. “Mervana tried it on Namaru and nothing happened!”“Well, unless his mom is here, it had to be her,” Virto muttered. His neurons were firing, trying to figure out any other plausible theory that could explain why Vargas couldn’t even stand. He barely even noticed the flame reflecting off the lens and frame of his glasses, turning around to see a growing blast of fire flying towards Sana.“Sana Jump!” Virto yelled, Sana turning around and screaming when she saw the inferno fill her vision. She flew up, the table she was hiding behind being obliterated into dust. Virto freed one hand and shot his pistol towards where the blast came from, nothing coming to stop the bullet from flying into the darkness.“Vargas, does any fire-affiliated yokai happen to live here?” Virto said, watching as the nureonago from earlier came out, her slimy, supposedly-watery hand casually covered in a glove made from fire. She caught the bullet in between to fingers, pinching it until it melted away to a gooey metal paste.“I suppose not,” Vargas said, clenching his muscles hard while he tried to muster any mana. His flames were still leagues below its power, even when he drew from the environment.“I guess that you weaklings are wondering why I haven’t melted from behind around the fire of a yokai~” She said, her other hand growing a similar glove. “I do too, but you two will be dead loooong before I can realize an answer~”“You’re putting a target on your back, you realize that, no?” Vargas said, sliding off of Virto once he could stand on his feet. “Before you know it, you would be killed for laying a finger on me.”“I intend to draw the attention~” She said, before raising her hands up to the moon. “For I was given the power to conquer all!”“Don’t forget about me!” Sana yelled, the nureonago turning around to meet a piano-sized sack being driven into her face. Her flames couldn’t melt through the sack fast enough, the pile of half-burnt piano parts, hitting her dead on. The sound of wood cracking can be heard as it struck against her, the slime shrugging it off to the side and turning her sights up towards Sana. “Insolent bird! Agh!~” A bullet hit her on her shoulder, Virto shooting away from her behind. She stuck out a hand and shot fire at him, Virto just side-stepping while keeping his finger down on the trigger. She tried bringing her other hand into the attack to wall him in with fire, but more rocks and large tree branches would rain down as Sana yanked them off the forestry to hurl from the air. At one point, she clawed a quarter of a tree off and dropped it down onto the slime like a bomber.“Enough!” The nureonago quickly got enraged, constantly being flanked and forced to divide her power between two moving targets. She completely disregarded Sana and made a mad dash for Virto, leaving a path of fire in the grass as she rushed towards him. “I’ll kill you both, starting with you!” Virto stopped shooting and moving, watching her rapidly close the distance once more.“You finally started using your brain hmm, shame I will have to cut it off!” She said, swiping for the killing blow at Virto’s neck. A wall of fire appeared before her, causing her to stop to a halt before out of surprise. “W-what? I didn’t…” Just as quickly as the wall appeared, it disappeared into the night, leaving one, angry and tired mouse standing in front of Virto.“Of course you didn’t, I did,” Ganan said flatly, a vein popping out in her forehead as she stared at the Slime. Above her was a portal made up of a ring of fire, one that Vargas jumped through soon after. “Careful,” Virto whispered, helping him land on the ground without falling too hard.“But, your power!” the nureonago exclaimed. "How!?"“To think you could sap my Master’s son’s mana and I wouldn’t hear of it?” Ganan said, her tone akin to a fuse that’s about to end. “I could have been training right now, but then Master forces me to come here!”“So what you are implying is, you are of equal strength~” nureonago licked her lips, forming gloves of fire around her wrists once more. “What a lovely gift~”“Lesser deity!” Ganan shouted to Sana flying above. “Leave this place, this no longer concerns you!” Sana, who had already witnessed so much today, squeaked and flew off instantly. Seeing her opening to attack, the slime rushed for Ganan’s wrist, only for her own wrist to be grabbed pre-emptively. It was squeezed to oblivion, the slime wincing in pain and liquifying her arm just so she could jump back.“As I thought,” Ganan said, having not even turned her head back to the slime to catch such a blur. Virto just watched, sitting on the ground with Vargas while the hinezumi took over. “Someone of your caliber couldn’t have taken on Master’s son head-on. You snuck an attack,” Ganan accused, staring at her with cold disgust. “Such trickery won’t work on me.”“So you’re quick, I still have fire!” The nureonago claimed.“Then use it. I’ll show you the difference in power.” She happily obliged, raising both her hands to prepare a blast of fire. Before a finger could be lifted though, Ganan wasted no time getting to her side and putting a front kick right into where her liver would be. The slime was promptly launched away, her crash into the woods with a bang. Everyone saw a path of destruction left behind, with trees knocked down and the landscape carved away to leave a nasty gash across the forest. Familes of birds scattered up into the moonlight in total shock. Even still, more thuds against farther objects echoed back. Virto was almost certain that whatever had attacked them was now dead or close to dying, even as a slime.“Jesus…ow!” Virto got grabbed by the ear by Ganan, getting snapped out of the power display as now the pain in his ear canal took priority. Vargas also suffered, the kitsune clutching his poor auditory fox peepers as they were dragged back through the portal, shouting in pain all the way.The two sat outside the Amaterasu’s private room, both having steaming burn marks of Ganan’s hand on their cheek. They could hear her demanding for them to be punished, over the sun god’s soft tone to try to calm the mouse down.“While, we’re here...” Virto started, gripping his dress pants. “I...I’m sorry.” Vargas turned to Virto, not having a hint of anything that he did wrong. “What do you mean?”“What else could I mean? I should have intervened way before, but…I froze.” He hit the wall behind him in frustration. “I froze, all because my stupid feelings wouldn’t get out of the way…”“Oh honey-”“Am, am I just a fun pet to you?” Virto asked, wiping the corner of his eye with his collar. “I feel stupid, dumb even but...need to hear it from you, please.”“W-wa...of course not!” Vargas said, picking him up by the hips. “Why I go all this trouble just to have sexual intercourse with you?”“True...unless you just really care about sparing my feelings…” Virto felt Vargas wrap around him, pressing his face against his chest once more.“It would be a lot easier to marry you if I wanted to spare feelings. The way you lumbered around with me on your back, even though my feet dragged along the ground...that only made me more sure of what was in here.” Vargas bapped the area heart twice, before curling a bit over Virto. “Tsss, ahh, still aches a bit...”“If it’s fatigue, then the best option would be a nice rest. Some medicine to block a thoracic root or two can help too, or just something hot held against the region...”“Like a kiss~” Vargas offered. Although, the door flung open before any lips to chest action could start. Ganan looked at the two before her and turned away, holding her head high as she marched down the hall. “Looks like you two owe me an explanation,” Amaterasu said, coming through the door and looking down at them. She still had her sleeping blindfold on, and her hair bundled up in a wrap on top of her head. “Especially you, Vargas. You know some people could be hunting you! Do you know how much a Yokai bounty can go for, especially on your head?”“It was only going to be a quick di-”“Ah, what was that?” Vargas’s ears dropped, his body shuffling an inch or two back. “Yes, mother…”“Mmhmm. Now come inside, we need you two to help us find her next morning since my pupil decided to kick her through an entire forest…”
  
    Chapter Text
    “I see,” Amaterasu said, laying on her bed while the two stood off to the side against the wall. “Is that all that happened?” Virto and Vargas nodded.“Then off to Vargas’s room with you! You’re both grounded until further instruction.”“Yes mother...” “Yes mom” They both left her room, closing the door behind them. She waited until she couldn’t hear their footsteps against the wooden ground, and sat back up. “Did you hear that Nabu?”In the corner of the room, Nabu’s form slowly materialized, slowly going from invisible to completely opaque in the dim nightlight. “Indeed. I shall have someone capture her immediately.”“Wait,” Amaterasu said, holding up a hand before Nabu could leave the room. “A normal Yokai won’t be sufficient to capture her. You heard them as clear as I did…”“If it’s fast enough, that power wouldn’t matter enough to warrant a higher council member.”“Like it did for you Nabu?” The Hakutaku remained silent, adjusting her hat. “My superior, you might need sleep…”“There could be a bit of you in there,” Amaterasu said, complying with Nabu and pulling the covers over herself. “Mana Stealing is a rare trait in Yokai, it would be good to have another one in the association…”“I...I will see to it that it will be done.” Nabu opened and closed the door, going to Vargas’s door and peeking into the room. “Son of Amaterasu-”She stopped, seeing them fast asleep and sprawled out on the floor. She stepped in and gently tapped Vargas’ hand, a portal with a ring of fire forming to the side of her. “A bit of myself…” she said, stepping through as the portal closed behind her. She had quite the bit of work to do, before that slime grew any stronger….“And then we fought this slime that shot fire!” Sana said, in the midst of explaining a fantastic story to her picnic mates. For once, she had the complete and utter attentiveness of everyone in the tent, except Nabu, who had resigned herself to a dark corner and put her headwear over her head. It was fine to Sana though; Nabu was usually tired or on something else whenever she looked over. “She was no match for the two of us, but then Ganan appeared out of nowhere and told me to run. And then boom! A line of trees has fallen over!”Seika: “Oh my!”Namaru: Is listening along while going through a bowl of chocolate-covered strawberries.Mervana: “Must have been one bad Yokai..”Sana: “She was. She did something to Vargas, and everything turned into chaos!”“She went after him? Ooooo, she is in trouble then,” Namaru said with a full mouth.“She could have been someone confident enough to go after the higher family,” Mervana said. “It takes courage to go after someone like that.”“Indeed! Nothing a mere side character or human can tackle, yet we did it with ease! I guess you respect me now, right?” Sana said, puffing out her chest and posing with her wings against her hips.“Respect you? We have always respected you,” Seika said.“W-wait what?”“We were just teasing,” Namaru continued, stuffing another strawberry in her mouth. “We would never mean anything like that, well, they wouldn’t.” Namaru got a tail flick from behind, causing her to drop her bowl of strawberries. She gave an upset look at Seika, who was staring up at the roof of their tent, sipping a chalice.“Since when did you have a drink?”“Ego semper erat. Imple meum calicem, et semel!” Seika responded, a caped guard coming to fill her cup back up. “I don’t have to answer that in a way you understand.”“Fine then. It should be around my turn to have an adventure anyways.” Namaru hopped up with a full mouth, walking past the chocolate strawberry spill and out of the tent. “Are you not going to clean up the mess?” Seika said. Namaru shook her head, slowly falling backward until she fell on top of a shadow and sank in. They watched her body disappear into the ground, the shadow bubbling until the last of her was gone. “Rude,” Seika said. “Nabu, won’t you do something about her?” Nabu only readjusted her cap, ensuring that her face was completely hidden from the group. She had her own things to worry about anyway.“So then I said, I will in fact, NOT, pick up the bowl of spilled strawberries,” Namaru said, sitting beside a small boy. It was nighttime, and she had caught him wandering around the darkness alone. The boy seemed either shy or afraid, or both, of the purple-eyed deity that looked at him with a predatory gaze. Her short, pointy ears shook idly; her neck-length white hair was tied up in a side-bun, the little strands passed the scrunchy-like purple flower blown around like grass in the wind. Her kimono left her entire upper chest bare, letting the boy see a blossom tattoo that went down the left side of her chest and body.“I think you have been staring too long~” Namaru said, grabbing his shoulder. A mist of shadowy mana followed her arm, falling down around the boy like a thick fog. “Getting a profile?~”“Y-you look pretty miss-” he quietly commented, clutching his garments and looking down at his lap with a blush on his face.“Well what a flatterer. What is your favorite part of me?~”“U-Uh-” She grabbed his hand, lifting his pointer finger and extending it out. “Come on; don’t be shy. Poke your favorite part~”Of course, he goes for the one part that made him blush the most; that flower that sat on her head and somehow bundled her hair. “It is really nice,” he said, thinking he had the green light to play with the flower. She let him get a few more pokes in but then put his arm back down. “Awwww, and here I thought you were going to say boobs.”“M-mommy told me that it is weird.”“Mommy is right. Tell me, did she also tell you anything about say…wandering through lands alone?” She moved her hand around in a whimsical fashion as if she herself didn’t know anything about what she was talking about. “Maybe even about the dangerous people that lurk outside?”“Oh! Mommy said that, you shouldn’t wander off from the house, because the evil night spirit will eat you!” He seemed excited about remembering what she said, the realization having not hit the young fellow yet. Namaru snickered, sliding off the chair as she laughed at the child’s naive response. “You seriously do not realize, do you? Maybe this will help jog your mind, young boy~” Her voice suddenly became more demonic, the light shadowy mist that was there before thickening until the boy could not see beyond his own hands.“Miss lady? Miss lady!” The boy yelled out, going around the chair to find her. She had disappeared though, completely gone from her seat. He started hearing groans and moans, seeing hands suddenly swarm his vision as the mist disappeared from around him. He wasn’t alone anymore, but it was far worse. There were various human silhouettes around him, purple misty outlines around the mass that surrounded him. They all had outstretched hands, slowly closing in on him and the bench like a hoard of zombies.“AAAAAAAHHHH!” He said, panicking like hell. There was nowhere to run, and unless he was suddenly given wings to sore to the heavens, it looked like it was it. He kept screaming as the zombies grabbed hold, going on top of each other to assimilate him into the mass of shadow servants. Namaru watched from a tree, filing her nails against the tree bark as she watched the child suffer. “Mothers nowadays. That is the second time he’s wandered off,” she said, disappointed. She craned her neck a bit to see if she could see the process, but there were too many of her shadows around obstructing the view. “Can’t a human recognize a Nurarihyon anymore? It’s the boobs isn’t it?” She thought, poking herself in the chest. “These big things on my chest distracting everyone that I catch….although, it could also be my deity power.” She looked around for a shadow casted by the moonlight, finding a shrub lucky enough to have an unobstructed look at the moon. She went over to it, reaching into the shadow and pulling out a book. “Lets see here…” She flipped through the pages to her species section and started reading, but she couldn’t focus over the eerie screams of a little boy yelling for his life. Well, eerie to any human. To her, it was just annoying.Irritated, she shut the book and snapped her fingers, the mob stopping its attack on the boy. It parted like a sea of darkness, exposing the half-turned child in the middle. His body was wholly as dark and uniform as the rest of the zombified servants, tears of white going down his corrupted body as he cried in a curled-up ball on the side. “You all are terrible at this,” Namaru said, picking up the crying boy in her arms. “What’s the point of sending you to corrupt people if you can’t even do it fast?” The zombies just stood around, mindlessly and silently looking at her awaiting her command.“I’m starting to question my choice to have total control of you all,” she said, putting a finger on the crying boy’s head. Is crying stopped instantly, hands going down to the side as she made him as mindless as all her other slaves. “See? Easy! Control the mind, control the soul. Does each one of you understand that now?” She still got only crickets while she put the boy back down onto the ground.“I’m going to pretend at least one human or yokai here said yes. Go now, shoo, you are not needed anymore. I corrupted the boy, you all can go back to waiting...wherever you wait.” She sent them away, the slaves fading back into the darkness of the night. For some reason though, the small boy stayed behind, his silhouette form-hugging her leg.“Come on little one, I said go. Go on with your new friends, you’re my servant now.” She reached into him, pulling out a gemstone shroud in smoke. “Your soul is now my property, tis the fate of anyone who wanders into my domain alone.” She put the gemstone back in him and tried shooing him away once more, but the body stayed hugging up to her thigh.“Even your body wants to go back to your mother?” She said, prying him off and carrying him in his arms. “Fine then, you will take me to your family then. I’ll ensure you are reunited.” The servant boy pointed away, Namaru sinking into one of the moon shadows to fast travel to his house. She’s somewhat blind while moving through total darkness, but she can always surface just a bit to sneak a peek of her location. She moved her legs back and forth, swimming through the void before suddenly turning up and resurfacing out of her domain. She poked two eyes out from under a table, in a lamp-lit family room as she saw a mother and two children. She then lifted the child out of the shadow, seeing if he would point to them. Sure enough, his arm stayed directed at the group of three.“Alright kids, it’s time to go to bed,” The mother said, herding the kids upstairs then coming back down. She waited about two seconds before falling into a chair, quietly crying into her hands. “Oh Zackary, where did you go...” she whimpered, hunched over her chair as she continued her sobbing. Namaru got out from under the table and went over to her side, the corrupted boy tucked under her arm. She tapped the mother on her shoulder, grabbing her face and forcing her around to her. “Boo~”“HeavenlyGodIprayforyouto-”“Don’t bother” Namaru lifted the mother with one hand, sitting her down on the floor and holding up her son like a teddy bear. “Is this your son?”“What….what, did, you, do to him!?”“Exactly what the tales say of me,” Namaru said. “However, your son is unusually clingy to his humanity. I would have just simply completely taken over his soul for my own bidding, but I’ve had...a change of heart.” The mother’s face got less angry and fearful as the Nurarihyon uttered those words. For that moment, she had a sliver of hope that the yokai would return her son, after going out of her way to return him to his home. “Are you ready to be reunited with your lovely child?~”The mother nodded, holding her hands out for her baby. Namaru put her son in her arms, then right after, pressed her thumb into the head of the mother. She weakly screeched before the purple darkness enveloped her, turning her into a slave just like her son. “There, now to do the other two children~”A trip to the bedroom later, and Namaru was walking out of the house, brushing off her shoulders and hands to a job well done. As she opened the door, a man holding a bag of flour and a rope halter for his horse. “Oh, hi!” Namaru said, the man stepping back. “You don’t look like my wife…”“Oh, I get that all the time,” Namaru said, pulling down her kimono to expose her breasts. “Although we could forget I existed for a nice night, if you get what I am referring to~”“I knew that shade of purple was suspect! Where’s my family!?” The apparent father yelled, dropping his stuff and rushing past her. He saw a group of four purple figures, all the sizes of his wife and his three children. “Oh, they are inside, just a bit more purple than usual.”“A bit? What sorcery is this?!”“Yo-you seriously don’t know what I am?” She spun around surprised, confused that he did not know either. She looked at her attire, wondering if it was the reason no one seemed to know what she was.“I know you are a monster!” The father pointed, hugging the body of his wife. “I shall slay you, and make you-huh?” He stopped his monologue, getting tossed a book that hit him on his chest. Inside the book was a bookmark, that disappeared when he turned to the page. “Nor-rye-ri-hewon?”“Nurarihyon, idiot. I seduce dense people like you and imprint my seduction onto your body. Haven’t you learned anything from a priest or a church or something?” The man tapped the book, seeing if he recalled anything about her kind. “In all honesty no.”“N-No!? I am supposed to be known for my seduction!”“So you’re a succubus!”“No! You-you know what-” She didn’t finish her sentence, finding a chair and shifting it around. She looked at the light and adjusted accordingly until the chair had a shadow that was as long as she was tall. “Listen up you dumbass Orderite, this is your once chance to get your family back.” The father seemed wary, but he didn’t have much other option but to oblige. He nodded, keeping himself between her and his family as a shield. “Obviously this entire village has been ill-informed of my presence, so I am going to have a little ‘chat’ with whoever is responsible.”“That would be the…the feudal lord down the path.”“I’m sure it was hard to throw him under the horse,” Namaru said sarcastically. She pointed to the shadow, stepping on it for extra emphasis. “This is how I am leaving. If this has not moved by the time I get back, and I am able to come into your house, I shall relieve the control of their souls.”“Yes Succubus, I wi-”“Nurarihyon!" She screamed again, putting her hands on her temple. "You are lucky I have a bigger slave to make than you.” She promptly jumped into the shadow, leaving him with four unmoving slaves of a family to watch over. He grabbed the waist of the largest one and hugged her tight. “Don’t worry honey, I shall get you back...I promise!”It wasn’t hard to find after a bit of travel. She sensed a lot of moving shadows and poked her head up, using the side of the building to push herself up and out of the void. She ended up in an alleyway, the buildings blocking out the sun on either side. “Smells like shit,” she muttered to herself, heading towards the noise to see what movement she saw. To her surprise and great delight, she saw a bunch of people gathered around the church, families filing in through the two wooden doors. More people means a priest, she thought, looking around and quickly plucking one of the women that passed by. She covered her mouth and nose, stifling her struggling and breathing until she passed out on top of her. “Goood girl,” she said, stripping her of her clothing and putting it on herself. She inspected herself in a nearby puddle, noticing how short and small the dress looked on her compared to the lady she choked out.“I probably should have found someone larger,” she said out loud, quickly joining in with the congregation and taking her place inside the church. She ended up next to a peculiar-looking man, wearing a red long sleeve shirt and jeans in a style that is hundreds of years too early, his parted afro having streaks of red and blue that flowed out from the part in the center. His shirt had a black Chinese dragon design going vertically down its left side. His shoes looked really out of place, with padded white soles and dark, rugged silk as black as her heart. A white swoosh was on each one, cutting through the darkness with light.“Well you’re the weirdest side character I have met,” she said while staring at his shoes. She poked the black shoes, the tip of her finger getting a bit through the small mesh on his feet. “Wait, there is a soft covering too?” The man she was staring at finally notice, feeling someone touch his Nikes. He grabbed her hand, whispering a psst into her ear. “You don’t look so normal either,” he said smiling.“You would have been tied to a rock and dropped in a lake, with whatever magic helped to create those clothes,” Namaru said. “I admire it~”“Does that mean we’re friends?” He said. “Or, could we be something more?”“Only an acquaintance right now.”“That is fine,” he said, a bit disappointed. He extended a hand out towards her, waiting for a courtesy handshake. “I’m Luke.”“Namaru, Deity of the Night,” she said, taking a handshake. “Although right now, I’m just a mere, defenseless village woman.”“That is over 6 feet tall.”“Deity status tends to make you larger than life, quite literally.” She said, seeing the priest coming past their row to the podium. “Aha, there he is,” she whispered.“Wait, are you going to murder him?” Luke said, suddenly alarmed.“Of course! Why else would I be here?”“You can’t murder the priest! He helps these people.”“Yeah, by making them fear succubi!”“Only to a reasonable degree!” Luke said. “No one here hates monster girls like those extremists, only the ones that attack the town!”“What? That makes no sense!” At that moment, another villager pulled off the hood on Namaru, exposing her head. “Uh oh-”“I know this is an orderite sector,” the villager started, getting in on the whisper-yelling. “But can you please be quiet! I am trying to listen to the word of god!”“Your god hates us!”“That’s only what the extremists believe,” the villager said, looking past her to Luke. “Your new fellow is ignorant, protector Luke.”Namaru slowly turned back to him, with a perplexed look on her face. “Protector?”“I keep the bad mamono away in exchange for food and a clean house,” Luke said. “Sue me, why don’t you!”“What does ‘sue’ me- you know what, I don’t care, I’m going to murder the priest regardless!” Namaru said, jumping up and pointing at him. “Hey! Old Fellow in the robes!” He stopped speaking, everyone turning her eyes to the mamono. “Ah, do we have a newcomer into our church?” The priest said, unbothered by her presence. “Our church welcomes all, now that we have realized the mistakes of our past.”“Then why haven’t I been recognized by anyone?!”“Maybe you are an obscure breed,” he said. You do not seem to be any of the more popular mamono. Are you a mage?”“I am a Nurarihyon.”“Ah yes!” the priest said. “A man that mates with you gains the charisma and seduction levels of an influential demon.”“Yes! That one, why do you not tell people about that one?”“Well, you are the first one in a generation to appear,” he said, stepping off the podium and going to her. “The last one that appeared in our part of the land was seen by my father’s father, but it was only passed down through a tall tale.”“That...might, have also been I?” She said, leaning back when the priest came and stared up at her.“He died in that encounter…”“Died? Oh no, I just take their souls captive.” The people of the church collectively gasped, murmurs going along the crowd about the chance of getting their loved ones back.“You must return them at once!” The priest claimed. “Holding people as slaves for your bidding is wrong and immoral!” Namaru just laughed in his face, falling in her seat hooting until she opened her eyes and saw the same stern look on the priest’s face. “...oh, you are serious.”“I know, deep in your heart, there is a part of you that knows your wrongdoing,” he said. “Think about how many wrongs that could be right by your hands!”“I would prefer not to,” Namaru said. “My heart is a literal shadow~”“I thought so...then on to bargaining it is. Luke…” the guy with the red and blue fit stood up, nodding in silence. “We shall give you our sole protector, a soul as unique as yours, as your husband or whatever role you see fit of him. That is how a mamono operates, no?”“You are not wrong….” Namaru snuck a hand under Luke’s shirt, feeling for any muscle under the polyester. Sure enough, she found a nice set of abs, giggling as she ran her hand across them like a washboard. “Yes, I think I will like this~”“It is decided then. You shall get an eternal lay, and the village will get their tenants returned to them?”“Sure~” She said, extending the word as if she wasn’t. She patted the old priest and touched Luke’s forehead, turning him into another slave before he could even blink in reaction.“Traitor!”“Blasphemy!”“We trusted you!”“I only did it so I could travel back to my domain,” Namaru assured. “It is a hassle to take living mortals through complete darkness…” With that, she stepped behind one of the villagers, blowing in her ear while she sunk in her shadow. The villager eeped and sidestepped away, mystified that her shadow stood still until she had disappeared into it.Namaru un-shadowed Luke once they were out of the village, letting him regain his bearings in a grassy clearing. He fell on his back once he had control over his body, his limbs weak and thoughts feeling sluggish. He put a hand over his eyes, light of the outdoors near-blinding him. “Where we….if I am able to ask?”“Outside, idiot,” Namaru said. “I do not have a home, so you have to take us to your home.”“I don’t have one either…” he said, pulling himself onto his arse once he had feeling in his legs. His hands and feet felt the worse, getting the sharpest pins and needles he had ever felt. “Did you cut off my blood flow?” He asked. Namaru shrugged, lacking any care for whatever happened to him. “I tend not to release control that often. It is probably harmless nevertheless.”“I, I can’t feel my ankles…”“Harmless! What isn’t harmless though, is that you don’t have a house…guess we will have to “borrow” one.”“Borrow?” Luke repeated, following Namaru as she started to move. “What does borrow mean? Wait!” He jogged after her, catching up and holding her hand. “You didn’t seem to answer.”“That should be a hint enough. We have more, urgent things to do.” She purposefully didn’t let anything on, walking with him all the way to another town. She snuck into the first house she spied, breaking a window with her elbow and pulling both of them inside. Luke yelped as he landed on the shards of broken glass, getting cuts on the arm he used to break his fall. “This is so wrong,” Luke said, seeing Namaru already up and peeking out of the room. She turned back and put a finger over her lips, motioning Luke to stay there.He looked around where he was, seeing a pretty spacious bedroom. He found clothes in the closet that he could use to stanch his bleeding, saying sorry to the owners under his breath as he wrapped it around his arm. He heard screaming that stopped just as quickly, then two more screams that cut off rapidly. Namaru appeared back in the doorway of the bedroom, covered in deep stab wounds that were filling with a dark ooze, like sweat forming in pores. “We have a house now,” she said as casually as she could to make him disregard the mess of her body. “And a couple maids, if you wish~”“I will p-pass,” Luke said, his panic alarm going off in his body.“Suite yourself, What is a few more to my army?” She skipped around and hopped on the bed, stripping off her kimono right in front of Luke. “I could use a maid however, these clothes need a wash.”“Don’t you want me outside?” Luke said, holding his non-bleeding hand over his eyes. He didn’t want to be rude, although he couldn’t help but blush at the thought of seeing the Yokai naked. “I-I don’t want to intrude….”“Trust me, I couldn’t care less if a mortal saw my bosom,” she said, some rustling going on beyond his blocked sight. “Of course, if you wanted a happy ending~” She said, Luke feeling something soft press against his forehead and face. “I am more than happy to see what you have down there~”
  Ruckus Ruckus.
“Would, would that be you moving?” Luke said, adjusting the bulge in his pants.“If I moved, you wouldn’t hear a sound.” She took her bloody kimono and put it over her breasts and front, summoning two servants to escort her out of the room. “Stay here again, I cannot have any witnesses in this home.” Leaving Luke behind, she stepped out of the room, then stepped back in to escape a fireball headed her way. It flew by her, singling the loose tips of her hair as it crashed into the other end of the hall and blew up the wall in flames. “That isn’t a human….”“Did you finally get caught by someone?”“It isn’t the Order either!” Namaru closed the door with rising alarm, a rush of fire appearing and spilling in through the thin slots between the door and the wall. A servant rose out of Luke’s shadow to drag him into the closet, shutting it closed and pulling a dresser in front of the door. “Hey! I can help!” Luke yelled, banging his fists on the door.“You will be in the way!” Namaru yelled, jumping back towards the opposite side of the room. The door was blown open by another fireball, a blue, armored slime walking in. An orbiting ring of more fireballs surrounded her, her wrists and legs covered in fire as well. She had a face of stone, her anger etched into the tight frown on her mouth.“What, did I happen onto your domain?” Namaru asked, tossing her kimono aside.“I am not after you. You’re just another piece to my reign.” The fireballs circling her all launched towards Namaru. Namaru dived to the side of the bed, the entire side of the bedroom catching on fire from the projectiles. The slime leaped onto the bed, holding a fireball in her hand. “It appears you have reached the end of you rope!” She reared her hand back, preparing to dunk the fireball right down into her, but Namaru was no longer there. “Retreating under the bed? How cowardly.”Namaru rose out of the slime’s shadow, grabbing her in a bear hug from behind. “Not as cowardly as using projectiles, however!”“W-are you slime as well?” The nureonago asked. “How dare you use my methods against me!”“Close, but still so off.” Namaru pulled her arms behind her back and kicked the legs out from under her, bring her down to the bed and pinning her down. The slime's body put out the fire under her, putting out the flames on the bed. “So, you’re this fire slime I heard of?”“I have fame?”“Only the infamous kind,” Namaru said, flipping her onto her back. “It’s an impromptu visit, but you would make a great reward in the organization.”“You don’t really think you can catch me as you are right now, do you?” Namaru removed her hands, hands from her shadow extending to keep the nureonago immobile.“Actually, I do. Fairly confident even.”“Oh really?” The slime said, chuckling as two more arms sprung out from her back. Namaru jumped back, going to the other end of the room as the arms excitedly tried to extend further. “As I said, fairly confident.”“You have no idea how much danger you truly are in. I can break out of the thickest of chains, and a master of all abilities. I am your god!” From her extra pair of arms grew hands of fire, extending even farther than her own body could stretch. Namaru, having no space to jump any further away, put up her arm to block. “Assh!” she groaned, the fire hands tightening around her forearm. She felt her vision go woozy, her legs becoming unsteady to stand on. “So this is what happened to Vargas…”“Just think of it as long, long, ball drain~,” She said, still stuck under the shadow hands. “Your manifestations stay even without your control? Oh, I am going to enjoy that~”“So you really do steal mana…” Namaru tried chopping the arm off, but 1) her hand burned as she went through the fire and 2) the arm reformed immediately, as all slime is immune to brute force, or at least resistant to a very high degree. She fell against the door, seeing double on the bed. The arms kept pumping away, taking her powers for the nureonago to abuse. I never even got to fuck those abs, she thought, her mind drifting back to Luke while she was fading.Crash! The sound of a breaking dresser reached her sluggish brain, but the feeling of lightning coursing through her body woke her the fuck up. She seized up and hopped onto her feet, yanking on the slimy fire until it broke off her body. She saw the slimeball not fare as well, shouting historically as a torrent of electricity ran across her body. "Ha! Serves...." before she could finish her retort she fell back into her drained. Luke out of seemingly nowhere caught her and picked her up, running out of the room and out of the house. “Where did you come from?” She said very groggily.“I broke out of the closet,” he said, a bolt of electricity jumping through her hair. “Sorry if my hair looks a bit poofier, it tends to turn into an afro whenever I use my abilities."“That was you?” She asked. “I thought she just shocked me…”“How else would I have broken out of the closet? Besides, she seemed like water, so I thought putting a few shocks through her would cause her to let go. She did scream a lot,” Luke said, running around a few trees a couple of times to make his tracks confusing. “Are you alright?” Namaru looked away, not wanting to answer. “I can see why you’re the protector now. I don’t owe you anything, but...I could reward you.” She reached up to touch his cheek, but she could barely graze tiny fuzz before her hand fell back down limp. “Ow…”“I think I know a good alternative…”The father was busy trying to figure out how the table was positioned compared to the lamp. Taking care of four blobs turned out to be more of a hassle than he had thought, his accursed family constantly moving around and messing up the furniture. He had more than once had to carry his children away from the chair and eventually decided to lock his children and his wife in his bedroom. It was hard, feeling like he had just caged up a bunch of dogs, but he had to do whatever it took to save them.“Oh god, oh god, oh god…” he said, sweating buckets while he shifted the chair around. Each movement of the shadow bothered him more and more, till he was afraid that he would never get it just right for the one holding his family hostage to free them. His heart sunk as he heard a thunk on his floor, and some complaining from the void that lied through the shadow. A moment later a hole was kicked in through his front door, the father back scooting himself into a far corner of the room. Two more holes were made before Namaru finally decided to kick down the entire door, followed in Luke.“P-Protector!” he said, seeing hope in his future. “Please! She took my family and she won’t let me go! I request your aid!”“He knows,” Namaru said flatly. “More importantly, I thought I told you to keep the chair still.”“It was near impossible!”“I hit my HEAD because of you!” She said, the husband cowering in fear. Luke put a hand on her shoulder, wanting her to calm down.Sigh…. “But, I have had a change of heart. I shall return your family despite you having no brain.”“Because the protector helped you find a bit of remorse and compassion in your heart for beings you consider lower than thou?”“No! Because, I ran out of mana.” She sniffed around and found in the bedroom, touching each of them on their heads. Their shadowy exterior seemed to get sucked up like a vacuum, going into her thumb and back into her body. She then had the care to toss them onto the bed, so at least they collapsed on something not the floor. “Truthfully I am weaker the more slaves I have, but I can always take my power back from each of them when they're freed. Think of you humans as my….hmm, Luke, say a word for energy storage.”“A battery?”“What the lightning abs boy said,” Namaru said, taking the last bit from the boy and tossing him onto the pile. She then dusted her hands, reforming clothes on her body as she went back out of the house. “Come on Luke, let us go fuck as we should have.”“N-no,” Luke said, Namaru turning around. “What?”“No!”“What do you mean no? You are cute and I have not even gotten to try your body!”“You still haven’t held up your end of the bargain.”Namaru's eyes narrowed. She walked up to Luke, grabbing his body and pinning him back against the front door. "If you think I am going to listen to that hunchback, decrepit old ma-”“I won’t move during sex if you don’t,” Luke said. “I can’t stop you from taking me by force, I know...but I know you want to see my muscles move. Also...you’re cute as well.” Namaru started at him, slowly turning red in the face while her face stayed frozen towards him. She dropped Luke harshly back on the ground and closed her eyes, a light purple shockwave flowing over each and everything around her as it went off into the distance. “W-what was that?”“My end of the fucking bargain, and not in the profane way.” A large line of shadows all came to Namaru from the village, forming a black-purple circle on the ground that grew as her body did its best to absorb the generations' worth of energy she was returning to herself. “What is a few hundred to thousands anyways?” She pulsed with light when she was finished, picking Luke back up before he could stand on his own. He gasped once more, seeing her eyeliner zoom right onto his torso."You have no excuse now, take off your clothing!” Luke lifted up his shirt apprehensively, letting her see his abdominal muscles. She cooed as she stared at them, sinking into the hole of shadow mana with Luke. “Ohoho, I could stare at these all night,” she said, disappearing into the void as she ogled away her new catch.~
  
    Chapter Text
    Mizuki ate her breakfast in the basement, surrounded by the mess of scrolls. They both finally decided that looking for each haphazardly arranged scroll could no longer stand and that it was about time that they finally tackled the issue head-on. The harvest season was over, and after a few overnight sweeps of the land, the leftovers have been burnt and made ready to decompose in the soil for the next cycle. It was time for the more winter-affiliated Yokai to take over and cool down the world.Mizuki had the first turn in organizing the small archive, and she started by pulling every scroll down from their cubbyholes and making a giant pile on the ground at the far end of the room. That was about as far as she had gone so far, eating her food as she stared at everything with dread.“Have you made any progress?” Anna said, peaking in to check up on her. “Of course I did, I already finished the first step!”“What about after?” Anna asked. Mizuki looked back at the pile, putting another mouthful down her gullet. “I know you wanted to help in this endeavor, so I saved the next step for you.”“This is absurd, I am not doing this by myself.”“Look at my hands, Anna!” Mizuki said, holding up her three-fingered claws. “Do these look like scroll sorting hands? I would do a terrible job!”“You can transform them.”“....I still don’t want to organize the scrolls,” Mizuki said, going back to eating. Anna signed and fully went into the room, sitting down beside her. “Then how should we get this done?”“We need to delegate the responsibility to someone else. Some yokai that wouldn’t mind organizing this by alphabetical order…” As soon as Mizuki said that, a paper poofed in front of them, landing on Anna’s lap. It was from Nabu, and it was a hastily scribbled drawing of her and Marsaw staring at them judgmentally.“I am out of people to call,” Mizuki announced after looking at the paper. “Should we get one of the town’s people?”“That would be too much of a risk, and grabbing a monster would yield the same problem,” Anna said, picking up one of the scrolls. “I wouldn’t be able to let that outsider leave intact.”“So we can’t use yokai, and we can’t allow anyone that isn’t a yokai down here….arrrrg-” Mizuki fell backward, landing in the pile of scrolls. She grabbed her head, squeezing her skull as she thought for a clean, lazy way out of work. It only gave her a headache, though. “Should we just go to the spa?” Mizuki wondered, having given up on sorting the scrolls.“Fine. Mervana may have a few ideas about how to get additional people.”The receptionist gave them a key and wicker basket full of toiletries, sending them on their way to one of the many rooms in the resort. “Enjoy your stay,” she said with a bright grin, watching them off as they turned down one of the halls.“I wonder how she works around the issue here,” Anna wondered, carrying the basket as she counted down the numbers on each door.“Well, all workers have to get hired, right?”“Not like that. This place is right on top of Mervana’s shrine. Wouldn’t it be harmful to a mamono to be so close to anything sensitive?” Anna found their room, opening the door and lighting a tiny fire on her finger. She found a candle and lit it, the candle illuminating the entire room. It was marble flooring surrounded by a crystal-clear pool, with two doors off to the side.“Pretty…” Mizuki said, taking off her kimono and diving immediately into the pool.“Mistress focus!” Anna said, setting down the basket. “This is a business trip, nothing more.” Mizuki reemerged, wading towards the edge of the pool. “The receptionist sure made it feel like a pleasure trip. She was so nice and welcoming, and had a nice look.”“What if we got such a receptionist?” Anna asked, thinking as she sat on the edge of the pool. “But, we don’t have a place to keep someone that works at our shrine….”“We build one!”“Mistress, we can’t simply build a new quarter.”“Anna, Anna, Anna~” Mizuki teased, splashing a bit of water on her. “Who said that we were going to do anything?”“Thank you Seika!” Mizuki told her while her servants packed up the building materials around them. “It meant a lot that you could come out so far down.”“I had nothing better to do. It was no issue, doing nothing while my servants transported an Edchina cross-country,” she said, bundled up in a bunch of blankets for her body and tail. “If only such a lamia had her own episode, maybe something of her own to do….”“Yep,” Mizuki said.“It does get lonesome, being the only one in the group that is located in the Mist Continent….”“Mmhmm.”“I suppose, I could, you know, keep a few followers waiting on their requests if it meant being with you.”“Indeed!”“So you do have something for me?”“No, but thank you for the help Seika.” Mizuki felt her tail get coiled around, seeing Seika’s tail around it.“Please, I am the only side character that has not had an episode,” Seika said, putting her hands on Mizuki’s shoulders. “There has to be some conflict at your residence, a disagreement, protection from the Nureonago, a minor and pointless divulge I can solve dramatically and interestingly!” Mizuki shook her head. “Sorry, but we pretty much have everything covered here. No need for your power or influence. But ahh...what is an episode?”“Oh right, you were not there for that conversation.” She cleared her throat and backed up, shouting something in Latin. Five servants came at her call and picked up, taking her back to her transport. “Wait, what is an episode?”“Forget about it, Mizuki! Please enjoy the oak!” Seika said, everyone filed away and up the path towards the mountains. Mizuki peeked around the grounds, watching the last of the servants run jog after without breaking a sweat. “What a quirky word. Eeeepisode…” she said, repeating it as she went back into the home. She took a gander at the new room, seeing how the different colors and freshness stood out against the worn-in wooden floors. A hammock and fur sheet was set up, along with a mat to sleep on. “Great! Now to just wait for Anna to come back with our new secretary…” Mizuki went to her backyard and sat, enjoying the fall scenery until she heard a portal open at the front of the house. Anna came through, carrying two children and having a catgirl following in tow.“I thought you were only going to get one,” Mizuki said. “Do we need three?” Anna shook her head, placing them in Mizuki’s claws. They were both hellhounds, one having burnt sienna fur and skin while the other white fur and white-blue skin. A turquoise dress covered the second child, with a gold-colored necklace around her, well neck. She wore wired-frame classes, taking a second to look into Mizuki’s golden pupils. “Um, hi...” she didn’t finish her introduction as the hellhound hopped down and went over to Anna’s side, gripping on the lamia's kimono. The last one was the faded red hellhound, adorning black mage attire and a black brimmed witch hat with a red band going around. “Please don’t leave,” Mizuki pled, not wanting her to jump out of her hands as well.“The maiden told me that you were the one who made it rain,” she said, standing up in the Ryu’s claws. “I want you to teach me.” Mizuki’s head darted up towards Anna with pure shock. “You told them!?”“Was I supposed to lie Mistress? How would I lie about a damn portal?” Anna asked, the white hellhound holding a jar up towards her. “Put that jar down, lass.”“I don’t know, you just, aren’t the type to reveal something so-”“How do I lie about a portal of fire?” she said it more forcefully, bending back when the jar appeared in her vision again. “Child, I told you, put that down!”“Mama said if you curse, you must put a dollar in the swear jar.”“Your mother is not here, we’re yokai, and what the hell is a dollar?”“Two dollars please,” the child asked nicely, shaking the jar.“Mistress!”“Give her two dollars!” The red one yelled from Mizuki’s shoulder. “If we don’t put a dollar, that means that cursing is not bad.”“Mistress we do not know what a dollar is!” Mizuki nodded and turn towards the hellwan. “What is your name?”“Herveen.”“Well Herveen,” Mizuki started, placing Herveen down on the ground. “We do not have what you are after, but, we may have some gold or extra food that we can give instead.”“Gold works!”“Then go with the nice lady with white hair and a tail.” Herveen nodded and went over to Anna, hopping square on her tail. “Let us go put food in the swear jar.”“Mistress she is on my tail…”“Just take them, they are kids which means they don’t know any better.” Mizuki waved it off, chuckling while watching Anna pull two children riding on her tail inside. That left the catgirl from before, sort of stepping to the side as if there was some fourth presence there. “I am Mizuki, I am assuming you are the secretary,” Mizuki asked, the catgirl nodding while looking down at the ground. “May I have a name?”“Y-yuki….”“Yuki, a beautiful name.” The catgirl blushed, rubbing her shoulder. “Come, I already have a job for you to do.”“I was promised a living space,” she asked.“Yes, we indeed have a third place for you to sleep. Although, I don’t know how long the children would be here.” Yuki nodded, looking at the entryways into other rooms. “So, what brings you here?”“My other master, she wanted me to go find myself,” she said. “I felt a bit lost though, but I saw the Shirohebi and…”“I understand,” Mizuki said, pulling the latch that leads to the scroll room down below. They went down, Yuki gasping as she saw the mess of scrolls on the ground. “This is…”“Mmhmm. Take as long as you wish, but we prefer it to be in some sort of alphabetical order.” Mizuki left the latch open, giving Yuki the space to take it all in. She went to the kitchen, where the two hellwans sat in the corner while Anna showed them various plants. “Have you given them the two gold yet?” Mizuki asked. Anna look to her side dumfounded. “We don’t have gold!”“Do you have two dollars?” The white-furred hellwan asked.“No!” Anna stepped back and stepped in circles, pulling at her hair in frustration. “Please, just take one of the fffffff-fancy fruits…”“No!” They said simultaneously.“Well, then our hands are tied,” Mizuki said. “Come on, Anna, there is nothing more we can do.”“But….” Anna’s kimono collar was grabbed as she was turned around, taken with Mizuki to the back. The two hellwans looked at each other then back at them. They finally realized they weren’t getting those two dollars, and would need to figure something else out for compensation. “Wait,” Herveen said, getting up. “Teach us to be yokai!” Mizuki and Anna stopped abruptly, Anna turning towards Mizuki. Mizuki shrugged, giving her the go-ahead as Anna turned around fully towards the two children. “You two want to be Yokai?”“We want to learn how to do portals and make the weather change like you two!” Herveen said.“Well, regardless of your wishes, your parents need to be here to say that you can…”Anna was steaming as a large, mace-wielding armored man bore down over her, his face completely hidden away by his head plate as the hellhound mother signed a permission slip for their children. However, it wasn’t steaming in her usual anger. It was her nervous sweat boiling off her body. “Alright, here we go!” the mother said, handing Anna the slip. “Dad would sign it, but he is a bit quirky around monster girls.”“I will kill you and have your head if a hair is out of place on them,” he said, the grip around his weapon tightening. The armor made his voice bounce around a reverberate like an evil microphone.“I will...make sure my mistress gets the message as well.” He didn’t react; only turned around and started marching away into the forest, his footsteps shaking the flora around him. “I shall start leaving too, we have to take care of the ones at home, after all!” The mom said starting to skip away. Anna exhaled once they were gone, glad for him to finally be out of sight. “Is that what I sounded like…” she muttered, walking around the shrine to the back, where the other three were seated in the rock garden. “I do not know how you were able to get your parents here, but they signed off on your lesson in mana.” Anna picked up the white-furred hellwan. “I will teach you how to be a proper maiden, and Herveen here is going to go with Mistress.”“Okay,” she said, adjusting her glasses.“You will do everything I say.”“Okay ma'am.”“Say your name.”“Pearl,” she said, speaking with a soft hazy tone.“Nice name, we shall get along Pearl.” Anna tucked Pearl under her arm like a football, taking her inside the shrine home. “Is she going to be fine?” Herveen asked.“Yes, I’m sure Anna doesn’t hurt children, anymore. Now then, you and I are going downstairs.” Mizuki guided Herveen through the house, showing her room and all the nice decor before telling her about the scroll room. “Anticipate a bit of a mess, we were in the middle of rearranging the scrolls.” She helped Herveen get down the staircase, just noticing now that both she and Anna tended to just slide down over the ledges. They rounded the corner but saw a completely clean scroll room. “As you can see it is…..organized?”“Is there a spell for that?” Herveen said, hopping down the rest of the steps and pulling out a scroll. Mizuki plucked it from her, unraveling the scroll a smidge. “Abstinence….this was not on the edge of the room before. This was arranged.”The two saw Yuki slump down over, having fallen asleep between a gap of shelves. She snoozed away, curling back up into a ball along the floor.“How big was the mess again?”“You wouldn’t understand…”
  
    Chapter Text
    Herveen and Pearl waved their parents bye as they started walking inside. Their legs were thigh-deep in snow, and more was already on the way. The frontcourt of the shrine was unusually barren of snow though, their boots breaking through the wall of snow and stepping onto the stone. The snow that had fallen on them and their backpacks instantly melted and evaporated, their clothing drying in the blink of an eye.“This must be the dragon’s power,” Herveen said, knocking on the door. Mizuki opened the door, peeking out towards the two. “Hello! Enjoying the weather are we?” Mizuki asked, looking up towards the sky. The snow above seemed to stop falling before it came below the house, heating up and disappearing into thin air. “Am I going to learn how to do this too?” Herveen asked, taking off the jacket over her clothing.“With due time. But, every teacher must, erm….” Mizuki looked behind her, Anna holding up a book as a reminder of what to say. “Every teacher...must gauge...the student!” Mizuki turned back around, holding a finger up. “Your progress must be known if I am to teach you effectively.”“I can do that,” Herveen said, taking off her backpack as well. “Pearl,” the Ryu then said, “you must go to Anna. If you both truly wish to rule the landscape, one of you must become a maiden.”“Alright,” Pearl said. She went past the two, meeting Anna inside. “Have fun!” Pearl said, waving before heading further inside with Anna.“She will!” Mizuki enthusiastically answered back, turning to Herveen. Herveen stood, waiting for the first thing that Mizuki would have for her to learn.“Now then,” Mizuki said, tapping her cheek. Her tail had coiled around the book on teaching, clutching it for she had nothing for how she was going to teach Herveen. Was there a process? Is there something she should say? What did her babysitter do when she was younger?“I want you to….” Mizuki started. “Show me what you know so far.” Herveen nodded and opened her backpack, unveiling her magic staff from before. This seems good, Mizuki said, watching Herveen hold out her hands. The wind started swirling around her, the mana flowing from her and gathering above Mizuki. Herveen’s eyes were closed, focus on making whatever she was making appear.Mizuki looked up in time to see a large boulder grow into existence, small pebbles falling and bouncing off Mizuki as it hovered ominously over her. “Such progress, I’m not even sure if this is creation or teleportation…”“I can’t hold it for too long,” Herveen said, her hands starting to vibrate back and forth. She turned and threw her hands to the left, grunting as she magically threw the boulder away into the snow.“That is swell. Can you do anything else?” Mizuki asked, watching the boulder roll and sink into the snow. Herveen thought to herself, straightening up when she got an idea for another spell she knew. Mizuki’s eyes seemed glossed over the entire time, watching her gather more mana together before disappearing with a small fire. She reappeared on Mizuki’s shoulder, leaning herself against her head winded.“Should I do anything else?” Herveen asked. Mizuki shook her head, blinking once before her eyes went back to normal. “You don’t have much mana,” she said, poking at her center. “You need to be more like a sponge, do you understand?” Herveen closed her eyes and tensed up, but Mizuki grabbed her before a second passed. “No no, if you do that, you will close off your body! Come, I have a much better method.”“Come on out!” Anna shouted, her arms folded as she sat against the wall to her room. “A maiden should be ready at a moment’s notice.”“The string won’t stay,” Pearl said from the other side of the door, struggling to tighten her kimono. She tied the best bow tie she could, yet the ribbon would slide against each other and slip away, letting the kimono drop back open. “May I wear something else?”“You may not! It would be a disgrace to the late yokai before us,” Anna said. “What it is, is that you must char the material. The clothing is moistened so I do not burn anything by putting it on.”“Huh?” Pearl said, not understanding the explanation.“Burn the string! God, I thought you were a hellhound...” Pearl held up the ends of the ribbon. Squeezing and rubbing her palms against it until she saw it start to give up smoke. She then tied it one last time, except now the ribbon wasn’t lubricated enough to slip away. She stepped out, looking like a miniature Anna if Anna wasn’t a snake and had paws for hands and feet.“You are looking like a proper maiden already,” Anna complimented. “Now then, we have wasted enough time already.” She turned around and went out towards the back, checking back behind her to see if Pearl was following close behind. Pearl had caught up, staying at her side and adjusting her clothes. “Are we going to learn magic as well?”“Magic is for the lazy,” Anna said. “Which frankly, is what Mizuki is. The maidens do all the dirty work, keeping deities proper and protected.” She took Pearl to a corner of the shrine area, where a talisman was pasted to the ground. The calligraphy written on it glowed a faint red, brightening to a vibrant yellow as Anna touched it with a finger. Pearl could feel the surrounding air grow hotter like she was standing right in front of a space heater. “Of course, all that the followers see is the fancy golden tail.”“Herveen isn’t lazy!”“I never said she was. However, who do you think is keeping the frontcourt warm?” Anna went to another corner and did the same thing. “Mizuki, even your sister could do this task. However, their magic- no, their mana should be reserved for bigger tasks.”“That doesn’t sound much fun,” Pearl admitted. “So all I do is keep the shrine clean?”“It is a thankless and tedious task little one, but thankfully you still have as much sway in nature as the others.” Anna went to the front, seeing Herveen desperately trying to keep herself upright seating on a statue, while Mizuki sat below her on the ground. “Gather more!” She urged on, her eyes glossed over once more. “You’re going to fall if you don’t have any mana to rest on!”“Mana...to sit on?” Pearl questioned.“Did you know Mizuki can fly?” Anna answered. “She uses her mana to glide through the air, pushing her own energy through the mana that floats dormant in the air. What you’re seeing, is a precursor…”“Coool…” Pearl said.“No, it is interesting, but it isn’t a physical temperature. Is it getting below your tastes?” Anna wondered, continuing her trip to check the talismans in the other corners of the plot. Pearl hung back, watching Herveen struggle for a few more seconds before finally falling off her perch on the statue and landing on Mizuki’s tail. “Again,” Mizuki said, rubbing Herveen’s forehead before putting her back on top of the statue.“Pearl!” Anna called.“Sorry miss!” she said, hurrying after Anna. The Shirohebi was waiting for her at the last talisman, tapping it with the tip of her tail. “Relight it,” she stated calmly.“I...miss, how I do relight it?”“You just, relight it,” Anna said. “It’s self-explanatory, isn’t it?” Pearl shook her head, nervously adjusting her glasses. “I never had to teach Mizuki this…”“You said Mizuki doesn’t do it because she’s lazy…”“I know what I said!” Pearl jumped back from the sudden rise in her voice, nodding along. “Alright, think of it like adding wood to a fire. But the wood is your mana.” Pearl nodded again, stepping in front of the talisman and holding out her hands. She turned them back and forth, appearing like she was warming her arms before a campfire. Anna cocked an eyebrow, not understanding her method. “Explain yourself.”“I’m trying to….put my mana inside the paper….” Pearl said, Anna not seeing any changes in the talisman. She sighed and folded her arms, letting Pearl struggle for another minute before moving her back. “I can’t let you embarrass yourself like this,” she said, annoyed like a father frustrated at his son’s inability to aim light. “Do you even know how to transfer mana?”“Herveen was the, more magical one…”“The way this is going she is going to be the only magical one. Here,” Anna said, grabbing Pearl’s arm. Pearl could feel the heat from Anna’s fingers growing hotter, reaching her skin through the wan fur around her wrist. “You feel that? That is me telling my body to push more mana into my fingers.” Pearl only half-understood, but she nodded along anyway. “Good, don’t let your body decided what you can and cannot do. You tell it where it wants to keep energy, and you want that energy here so you can touch that talisman and make it hot, right.” She pushed Pearl’s arm back at her side, moving away once more. “Well go! It is going to get cold here if you stand there like a pole.”“Y-yes miss.” Pearl kneeled on the stone, touching the talisman with her fingertips and focusing on her hand. She kept repeating in her head to push her power towards one point, mouthing come on. Her fingers started to crinkle the paper with how hard she was pressing, tensing every part of her body she could.“At ease, you look like you’re going to go on the floor,” Anna said, Pearl exhaling and falling back on her butt. She put her face in her hand, disappointing in herself. “I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t feel anything…” Anna didn’t say a word, letting her wallow in her pity.Pearl felt the heat of the corner comfort her first, leaving her confused as she had thought her effort had amounted to nothing. She opened her eyes, seeing the talisman glowing. It wasn’t yellow, only a cooler red, but it was making heat regardless!“I, did it?” Pearl asked herself. “I did it!” She looked towards Anna for praise, but only saw her notice and turned her head away. “It could have been hotter…”“I need more mana then. I tried focusing, but it was like there was nothing there!”“Nothing there? Interesting…”“Yokai like Mistress and I can naturally absorb mana, but the lesser mortals don’t have such a capacity,” Anna explained as she took Pearl with her down the hillside. “We don’t associate with those weaklings. We are above them, and they recognize our ability through their sacrifices and offerings.”“However, that doesn’t mean one cannot learn.” Anna burned the bush beside her, giving space for Pearl to move in front of her. Before them was a small waterfall, made from a miniature cliff break in the river. Mizuki was already there, hair matted to her head and neck and floating on the water and watching it fall down onto Herveen.“Mistress, you also had the idea?” Anna asked.“I know, it’s artificial,” Mizuki said, giggling. “Herveen is taking it well though.”Herveen was, in fact, not taking it well; taking it terribly, actually, from having mana-infused water pouring down on her in the middle of snowfall. She shivered, using her staff to stay standing despite the frost. “I’m, so cold teacher…” she complained.“Use your newfound mana to radiate heat, then! Go Herveen!” Herveen nodded, still shivering as she tried to turn her mana into thermal energy.“That is not how to use positive reinforcement!” Anna told Mizuki, going into the river and pulling Herveen out of the water. The water steamed off Anna’s hands as she carried Herveen away. “She’s absolutely freezing!”“But the book said that cheering on lads would make them better,” Mizuki said. “I followed that line to a tee.”“That line wasn’t meant for leaving a child in the snow!”The two brought Pearl and Herveen back to the shrine, Mizuki pulling the water out of Herveen’s fur and clothes while Yuki covered Pearl in blankets. Anna came out of her room, holding a blood-smeared wrist.“Oh no, what happened?” Mizuki said with concern.“The father isn’t fond of teleportation, the ba…the cu….um.” Anna trailed off, trying to find a word that wasn’t considered a slur. “The wank.”“Swear jar,” the two of them both said at the same time, Herveen sneezing after she said it.“It wasn’t a swear! And why do you to know it? Are you children just as vulgar, hmmm!?”“We don’t,” Herveen said, staring at Anna. “But it is from you, so it’s probably a swear.” Anna scoffed, finding the redirected accusation absurd. She turned to Pearl, putting on the sweetest smile she could. “Pearl, underling, you do not find my mouth to be a potty mouth, do you?” Pearl looked down and away from Anna, unable to tell her the truth to her face.“Fine then, I guess even then secretary thinks I am a sailor!” Anna was exasperated. Yuki’s ears stood on end as she heard and quickly got out of the room.“Your language issues aside, Anna, are their parents coming to pick them up?” Mizuki asked, removing the last bit of water from Herveen’s ankles and toes. Anna nodded. “Again, the father was not too happy.”“Why not?”“Well, it’s surely not because we threw his child under a waterfall in the middle of a snowstorm.” Anna looked towards Herveen, who had stopped shivering and was just hugging her share of blankets. “I apologize for the stupidity of my Mistress.”“It’s okay,” she said. “I learned so much today. I fell a lot, but I learned a lot.” Yuki came back with coffee for Herveen, placing it in her lap. “Thank you!”“See?” Mizuki said, seeming not to understand what she could have caused. “It all turned out fine. And I am sure they wouldn’t mind coming back another time.”“Only after winter,” Herveen said. “I am never going near a river again!”

    It had been another week that had passed, and another picnic that was agreed to be held. This time, though, it would take place up north at Seika’s place. Even with Anna, having a picnic outside in winter temperatures was simply too much of an annoyance. Mervana could not make it either, as she was one of the winter yokai that had to work.Anna materialized the portal in front of Seika’s home, snekking through it and burning a patch free of flowers. “Did you remember to send Herveen home today?” She asked Mizuki, seeing her head poke through the portal. “Of course, I am not that forgetful.”“I don’t expect you to be Mistress,” Anna stated, hearing rustling coming from all sides. A number of Seika’s servants appeared from behind the forestry, wielding spears. They approached from all sides in a defensive stance, one of them going the closest to Anna. “Tu Mizuki et Anna?”“Did you remember the line?” Mizuki asked Anna, pulling herself through while Anna talked back to the servant. “Nos sunt, nescio quid dico in latinis. Frumentum, pedes, aliis mauris quae.” The wooden mask over her face and her sudden stillness made it impossible to tell if she had said the right thing or not. That was until she wasn’t, giggling behind the mask while leaning on her spear. “Te sonus usus est interpres!” She said, the rest of the group slowly joining into the laughter.“What, what did you say?” Mizuki asked, confused at why they were all laughing.“I don’t know…” Anna said, being tapped on the shoulder by the girl. “Mizuki, Anna, come. Leader awaits you,” she said, the group calming itself down and surrounding the both of them. She escorted them to a temple that rose above the land, the birds and harpies barely flying above the top. She pointed to the top of the stairs, then called out something to the servants behind her. Two each started to lift Mizuki and Anna, but neither needed the gesture.“No no, I can get up on my own!” Mizuki assured, simply floating herself off the ground and flying up the temple. Anna was a bit more forceful, setting them aside and going to a secluded enough space before shooting fire at the ground and propelling herself up after her Mistress.They landed on a roofed platform, accessible by the long stairs on each of the pyramid’s four sides. Of course, the others were already there, picnicking in the warmth of the tropical climate. Sana was the first one to notice them and waved her wing, her and Namaru scooting aside to give the two some space to land. “Did you enjoy the greeting party?” Seika asked, hiding her laughter in a tight grimace.“It was very humorous,” Anna said sarcastically. “I would love to know what I said if that is fine with you.”“Oh no, it is better without knowing,” Seika said, stifling a chuckle. “I am just happy that we can all meet together again. You know, minus Mervana since she is working, and Nabu…” They all looked at Nabu’s empty spot.“Did Nabu say that she had things to tend to?” Sana asked.“Not that I recall…” Seika replied. “Actually, I have not had any contact with her at all since the last meeting. Even then…”“Silent right? Just a total shut-in,” Namaru said. “Maybe she is having her own character development episode, I don’t know.”“There is that word again,” Mizuki said. “Episode. What does that mean?” Sana, Namaru, and Seika all looked at each other, then looked back at Mizuki. “You don’t know?” Namaru asked.“Not at all, this is the second time I have heard that word.”“Do not mind it then,” Seika said.“But-”“Tomatoes!” Namaru yelled, before promptly getting her clothes burned by Anna. She jumped and swore, frantically trying to bap the fire out while the servants came up and pointed spears at Anna. “Non uti ignis in sacrum templum!”“Non uit ignis your ass,” Anna said, blowing the smoke out of her fingers. Seika waved them off, the servants slowly starting to back away. “How did you get so many of these people? It is like they are all one person.”“Well, I have what the mortals call a ‘cult of fertility’,” Seika said. “To put it simply, many couples, human and mamono alike, wish to bear children, and I can fulfill that wish~” Seika formed a ball of green mana in her hand, and just as quickly dissipated it. “I had to take a few networking lessons from Nabu, but after that, growing my influence was as simple as having a baby.”“Which wraps around back to our original problem,” Namaru said, taking off her kimono and exchanging it for another in her shadow. “Mizuki, have you and the pyromaniac seen Nabu?”“I am sorry, we have just had so many other things going on that we missed out on speaking to her. I do hope she is alright though.”“Probably,” Sana said. “She is probably just doing her character episode. Mine was pretty peaceful, aside from the Nureonago.”“So was mine. Although Nabu can’t fly and doesn’t have any powers….” Namaru said. “I hope she can hold herself if she runs into her. I heard that slime of a bitch has been attacking Yokai left and right.”“So, that be a room for one,” The kitsune receptionist said, writing the information down a slip of paper. “May I ask for a reason for the visit?”“I have a meeting with the head of the resort~,” The Nureonago said, juggling tiny balls of fire behind her back in her hand. She had a polite and cordial smile, but her true attention was hidden behind her facade. The receptionist didn’t seem to pick up anything out of the ordinary, however, handing her a key to one of the residential rooms.“Don’t we all, right?” The kitsune said. “Unfortunately, it is a bad time to schedule for visitors. Our boss is a bit held up due to her duties, but the second-in-command can handle any issues that you have.”“I understand, it’s just a small talk between us though,” she said. “Yokai to Yokai, matters that go above a mamono’s understanding. You understand, right?”“I suppose I don’t,” the receptionist said, sighing. “I still cannot disclose her whereabouts, however.”“There is no need!” Announced Mervana, coming down from the hallway holding a bottle of Sake. “For I am here! Ha, haha.”“Boss you’re drunk!”“So you’re the famed yokai of the mountain,” The Nureonago said, licking her lips. “Just the lady I wished to see.”“Of course, of course,” Mervana said, a drunken blush on her cheeks as she took another swig from the bottle. “Come come! Let us go somewhere that is more private for us.”She is just handing herself to me on a platter! The slime thought to herself, nodding. She could barely wait, but she stuffed her hands in her makeshift pockets, following the drunken kitsune down the hall. Although, she then noticed the number of tails that dragged along the floor. Youko usually have multiple tails, right? She thought, seeing a lonely tail swish along the wooden boards. A deity would most definitely have enough mana to warrant more than a single tail...unless….“Wait, I wish to speak somewhere more public now,” the slime said, stopping her pace. Mervana stopped ahead of her, standing there menacingly while faced away from her. Her aura could be felt damping and becoming overbearing, an invisible cloud of death that suddenly filled the air. Walls of ice rose behind the Nureonago and in front of the kitsune, trapping them both within the small hallways space. The slime backed up, raising her hands and forming gloves of fire around them. “Who are you!?”“I could ask you the same question….” Mervana said, her hair and features starting to change. Her fox tail became more curly and goat-like, her body enlarging and growing wider. Her long, unkempt hair was shortened to a neater, more uniform cut. She took the blue, flower-patterned kimono off, exposing a green suit underneath. “I prefer to get a name to call you before any action begins,” she continued, taking glasses out of her breast pocket and putting them on. “I apologize for the formal look, it is easier to wear these than my usual clothing…”“I said who are you!?”“The only person who understands you,” Nabu said, turning around and brushing the hair out of her face. She dropped the bottle of sake, the bottle breaking into a bunch of ice, rather than glass and spilling any alcohol. “I asked Mervana for her powers before you came, I figured that if you were going to attack any other innocent people, a yokai with a resort would be your next target.”“I wouldn’t call them innocent,” she said. “Only mere obstacles in my way.”“And where has that landed you?” Nabu said, “Only Amaterasu knows how many other people have fallen to your powers, and now you have my attention.” Nabu extended one hand out, walking towards the slime. “You cannot fight your way out of this, your only route is to comply.” The slime stayed on guard, but she put down her arms, the flames going out around her hands.“I suppose it is the best solution…” the Nureonago said, walking to Nabu and gripping her hand. “Unfortunately for you, you are the one that can’t fight their way out of this situation. Ice!” She yelled, spawning a thick coat of ice around Nabu’s body.At least, she thought she did.“Oh?” Nabu said, still warm and ice-free. The nureonago was baffled, gripping Nabu’s hand hard and trying again. “I said Ice! Ice, ice, ice! Damn you!”“I think you have to do it like….this~” In an instant, the nureonago was frozen in a razor-thin sheet of ice, then swung over the Hakutaku’s shoulder. She was sent crashing down onto the floor, unable to use her slime body to avoid taking damage since her outer layer was frozen solid. She was tackled into a hard pin with the wind knocked out of her, Nabu keeping one arm raised, while, pressing her knee into her back and the slime’s face into the ground.“Impossible! I should have, gotten your power…..” The nureonago said. She tried to melt her way out of the pin, but each break through the ice was met by it rapidly freezing her back into place.“You should have, but you cannot do it to another mana-sutiru yokai,” Nabu said. She pressed harder, the slime grunting as her frozen body began to crack. “If you are smart, you will start to listen now.”“Nev….eerrr-” The shadows they made in the hallway rose, forming into hands that grabbed at Nabu’s neck and body to pry her off.“Ah, so you have gotten this power as well,” Nabu said, the arms appearing to not affect her grip. “What other powers have you, acquired child? Show me!” The nureonago just grunted some more, but with her body stuck in the ice, any other attack was mute against the weight on her. Nabu’s hand started to glow, appearing to charge up something point-blank against the slime’s head.“I...yield…” the slime said while trying to wiggle her arm out of Nabu’s grasp. She wasn’t ready for whatever Nabu was going to hit her with, squinting her eyes as the white glow on her hand got brighter.“Calm yourself, I am only going to look at your mind,” Nabu said as if she was just borrowing a shovel.“W-wait what, what!?”Spew! The flash grew to stifle the slime’s whole vision, leaving her seeing white until her eyes adjusted back down to the semi-dim light of the hallway, seeing Nabu look down at her with regret and pity.“...what, did you see.” The Hakutaku’s silence left the air feeling thicker than ever before, The ice around the slime starting to fade.“What did you see!”“....enough.” It was barely more than a whisper, and yet it was enough to set the nureonago off, her legs breaking through the ice and kicking Nabu square in the gut. It sent her careening into the ice wall. She got up, clutching her gut while using the ice wall for support. Tamiko walked furiously towards her, each step leaving behind a footprint in the charring.“You don’t know me, you don’t know what I did, you know nothing at all!”“Tamiko, calm yourself,” Nabu said. “I know how to help.”“You were going to kill me just a moment earlier!” The sl- no, Tamiko said, putting her arms together. She began charging up a glow of her own, except it wasn’t a glow; it was a fireball. “I don’t need to calm down, I need to take the initiative!”“Do you not realize what power you hold?” Nabu said, not doing anything to stop her. “How rare your ability is?”“I know exactly what I hold!”“No, you do not. Tell me, have you seen any other yokai that was able to take other people’s mana as their own? Don’t you want to know where you got it from, how you can improve it?” Tamiko’s fireball calmed down as she seriously considered Nabu’s offer.“Trust me, what you are doing is puny compared to what you could do, but going around attacking Yokai is only holding you back. You need guidance, Tamiko,” Nabu said. Tamiko seemed taken aback that she was called weak indirectly, but stopped putting mana into her fire. “And what makes you think that you are in any position to talk?” She asked. “I don’t plan on falling for your tricks again.”“You already have, I am not even here right now.”“What.” At first, she was confused, but then she became perplexed as Nabu’s form faded to a mere shadow, the same type of shadow that Tamiko had been fighting against earlier. The slime had no answer for this, trying to grapple with the fact that Nabu’s real body wasn’t even the one she was fighting.“It was simply easier to just control forms rather than look for you in person. It used up quite a bit of power, but once I had your location, I could be rid of the rest.”“I….”“I do not have much time left. I was never good at endurance...find your predecessor,” spoke the shadow. “With proper guidance, perhaps you could cultivate your abilities for the benefit of all…”“Wait!” Tamiko said, trying to grab the shadow as it melted back down into the ground. It was too late, though; once Nabu had given up control, it started returning to its stateless form. “I never even got your name…”Nabu’s eyes returned to normal once she finally let go. She was sweating from top to bottom, having expended mana for the first time in a while. She collapsed in the room she was sitting in, panting on the ground as the world spun around her. “Finally….”A knock came from her door, giving her only a short moment to react before someone had opened it. “Oi!” Went the man. “You were making a bunch of noise! Keep it down!”“Yes, I just had a bit of a panic attack,” Nabu said, the man coming in to help her up. To him, she only looked like an unusually tall girl, throwing her arm around his shoulder as he pulled her up to her feet. “God, you’re sweating like a pig,” he complained. “This is the last time I decide to check on a tenant….”“Thank you again,” she said, sitting on the bed. “Do you have any water?”“Do you have any water,” he muttered mockingly. “Yeah, I’ll go bring it for your arse...don’t get paid enough for this shit.” He kept complaining through a grainy voice as he slammed the door back shut, Nabu scooting herself onto the bed. She stared up at the leaky ceiling above her, thinking about what she saw in Tamiko’s head. “That is the last time I decide to use a lead that takes me to an unkempt place like this,” she said out loud. As long as she is with a yokai, I can track her position. Just a matter of figuring out which one she decides to run to…“Aww, do you really have to go?” Seika said to her comrades. “But there is still so much to eat!” Seika was the only one that was still half-full, but everyone else was absolutely stuffed, though, all laid down on the ground and clutching their stomachs. Sana was doing the worst, her smaller harpy body not doing well for binging on several courses. A servant was constantly beside her, holding a basket made for her in case she could no longer keep it down.“Forget eating, I might have to sleep over,” Namaru said, covering her mouth as she felt something come up. “Why do you have so much cooked meat at your disposal Seika?”“Using my mana on followers uses up quite the bundle of mana,” she said, two servants bringing another roasted boar for her. “Mizuki sweetie, don’t you control the weather? That must be absolutely draining without constant food.”“Apparently not….” Mizuki said, hunched over on her side. “A-Anna, I-I don’t like eating anymore….Anna?” The lamia was knocked out, having eaten herself into a food coma one turkey ago. A servant tended to her while she slept, fanning her up and down her tail so she wouldn’t burn up.Seika sighed and lied down herself, being fed slices of boar as she played with her hair. “You all are simply too much, I even had a dessert for us to enjoy…”“It’s almost sundown!” Namaru yelled, “We ate for hours!”
  
    Chapter Text
    It was the beginning of a new year. The snow was still coming down as hard as ever, pelting the forest with a constant downpour. For someone that prefers to stuff herself in a sauna than work, Mervana has been so productive that she hasn’t stopped making it snow for a month straight. The only thing that changes is her reach from her mountain; on a good day, she can reach just before the ocean, yet could restrict the snow to just her area.Unfortunately, her area is well within reach of Mizuki's forest. They were eternally downwind to a cold winter, keeping inside for most of the past month. They had even sent the hellwans home early, their parents unable to pick them up near the latter times of the day through the snow.“It has already reached above my ankles,” Anna said, talking about the level of snow as she swept the courtyard. Her talismans were still doing a good job, keeping the box of their land heated and winter free. Yuki stood by, holding a torch for light since the clouds were hiding away the sun. “You have ankles,” Anna said. “Can you go stand beside the snow?” Yuki nodded and went beside it, rubbing her arm and leg as a bit of her body went outside the barrier. “Exactly, it does come above your ankles. Your legs even,” Anna said. “I couldn’t go outside in these conditions….” Yuki nodded again, stepping away once it was too much to stand at the edge of warmth. She was only wearing a skirt and sweater, after all. “Go get Mistress, I want to ask her to go visit Mervana.” The catgirl nodded one last time and hurried inside, leaving Anna to resume her cleaning. She was on polishing the dragon statues, stopping when she heard the mysterious clopping, muffled by the impact with the snow.She went to the edge of the heat box, seeing an entire procession arrive in front of the shrine. Everything was made out of blue slime, yet detailed enough to fool the common eye. Several samurai marched in front of the chariot, lining up along the line between the snowy forest and warm cobblestone. Three pairs of horses pulled the large chariot up the incline, coming to a stop right behind the guards. Anna had a deadpan face the entire time. She never cared for the royal/powerful types that would come and request a favorable harvest season. Although, she was confused about who would be dumb enough to come in the middle of winter…The samurai guards parted down the middle as more guards came to make a path. A Nureonago walked down it, the only one dressed in clothes that weren’t created from slime. She wore a blue, river-themed kimono and a headdress that went up farther than her head and bejeweled with white gemstones. She walked daintily, keeping herself from sinking in the snow as she came in front of Anna. “Hello, honorable Yokai of the Harvest~,” She said, bowing in front of Anna.“Am I supposed to know you the same way I 'knew' the Fairy Queen?” Anna responded with her usual disinterest.“I understand, a mere princess holds less prestige than a yokai as your self. However,” she said, opening a hand fan. “I am not just royalty, fufufu~”“Mmhmm. State your business,” Anna said. “This outta be good, as you’re coming to a Harvest shrine…”“Amid the winter season. I am well aware. My business does not concern any crops, however. I simply had to meet with the Harvest deity, as she is-” Anna held up a hand to stop the Nureonago’s speech, leaning on her broom. “Whatever you think, I am not the deity you are after. I am her maiden.”“Ah! I didn’t know the maid answers the door,” the slime jested, seeing two puffs of smoke coming out of Anna’s nose. She fanned the smoke away from her, before turning the hand fan onto herself. “So, where is the true deity then? Busy controlling the lands, I presume?”“If you consider sleeping as controlling the land.”“What?” Said the Nureonago confused. The double doors to the home then opened, Yuki dragging a half-asleep Mizuki out onto the shrine grounds. She rubbed her eyes, adjusting to the increasing darkness of the sky.“Is...that her?” The princess asked, walking past Anna to Mizuki. All of a sudden, she seemed infatuated with the Ryu, staring at her like a forgotten relative. “Is that my long-lost mother?”“Hmm?” Mizuki said, staring at the slime as Yuki held her hand. “Who is our visitor, Anna?”“Let me reintroduce myself,” the princess said, coming up to Mizuki and bowing. “I’m Princess Tamiko, the Rain deity of the land, savior of my village, and your blessed offspring.” Mizuki nodded along, but it wasn’t until she repeated in her head did her baggy eyes widen. “I have a what!?”Tamiko was ushered inside, made to wait in the rock garden. Yuki was placed on watch, sitting on one of the seats while watching the snowfall. She held her hand out towards the snow, watching her slimy fingertip start to freeze up in the weather. “Interesting….”“She’s my what?” Mizuki said again, quietly in a whisper tone, but with just as much shock. She and Anna were staring on at her from behind the opposite side of the kitchen into the backyard. “She said mother. I do not understand it either Mistress,” Anna whispered-shouted back. “Should I burn her alive?”“No!” Mizuki said. “If it’s true, and this ‘Tamiko’ is really my daughter….but, I never even got together with another man…”“That’s the part that confuses me the most,” Anna said. “For all your laziness and succubus-like body, you are a sexual saint.” Mizuki pouted at Anna for that comment, but turned back to Tamiko, innocently showing Yuki a nice ball and cup trick made from her slime. “We need to talk to her.”“Then I burn her?”“No,” Mizuki said, taking a deep breath before going to her. She reached around, knocking a claw on the outside of the doorway behind Tamiko. “Tamiko, we need to talk.”“I am all ears mother,” she said, moving out of the way to allow Mizuki to sit down in front of her. She put a hand down on Mizuki’s lap, looking up at her as a tear came down from her eye. “We just have, so much to catch up on….”“Like, our connection,” Mizuki said, putting her hand over Tamiko’s hand. “You seem very nice, but I never had any children or any mates.”“Oh, did you mean that method? you thought…” the slime started laughing, chuckling into the sleeve of her kimono. “Oh, that is funny! Of course, you aren’t my biological mother, although I wouldn’t mind getting such good-looking genes.”“You make me blush,” Mizuki said, rubbing the back of her neck. “So, how am I your mother, then?”“Who else could give me such powers?” Tamiko said. “The power to make it rain and control the clouds?”“Not me, that is for sure.”“Ah, but it is you! It has to be. Every other yokai I came to had the wrong abilities or just didn’t feel right, but you…” She put her hand over the area where her heart was. “You just feel so right, like I have finally come home to my roots~”Mizuki was confused since she also didn’t “Well, how did my daughter come to be then?” Tamiko seemed excited to tell her origins, seeming to have prepared a tale for this exact occasion. She scooted herself back, creating a flat plane out of water that hovered over the rocks. From the plane rose a small blob with two eyes.“Once upon a time, there was a valley where a lovely little village lived,” Tamiko started. “And outside that village, lived a sad, little girl with no one to love her.” A bunch of taller blobs rose around the small one, all of them congregating with each other, but seeming to avoid her like the plague. Mizuki watched, holding a part of her tail like she had tucked her legs in and was resting on her knees. “Oh gosh…”“One day, the valley was threatened by a terrible drought,” Tamiko said. “The oh-so-divine goddess in the lands above gifted it with showers. What she didn’t know, is that her rains blessed the poor girl.” She created a cloud that hovered over the little blob, the little blob growing to a larger blob than the others, adorned with a small crown on her head. “She became something more, and with her new power, she became the valley’s true deity, and everyone loved her~”Mizuki had mixed feelings, wondering if the slime had implied anything about her in that story. She still thought the ending was wholesome though, awwing when she saw all the blobs gather around her with happy eyes.“Yes, but I still felt empty, mother,” Tamiko said. “When I was alone and cold, the gods saw my plight and gave me my newfound form. I never got a proper chance to thank them….until now.” Tamiko went to hug Mizuki, resting her head on Mizuki’s shoulder. Mizuki patted her back and head, looking down at her with a smile. “I never knew my storms had such a damning effect, but I am glad they did,” Mizuki said, still in partial disbelief. “I mean, I have a daughter!”“And I have a mother! You, you wish to be my mother right?”“Of course, daughter.” Tamiko nodded and squeezed Mizuki for a moment, letting go and tidying herself up. “Sorry, I know I should act regal in front of a deity…”“Oh, that’s only what Anna says,” Mizuki said. She turned to the inside, seeing Anna still watching from inside. “She is the more strict one around our part of the land.”“Seems like she could loosen up,” Tamiko joked, getting a giggle out of the Ryu. “Indeed, do you mind stepping inside? It would be rude to leave family out in the snow.”“I don’t mind, the Shirohebi made it cozy and warm,” Tamiko said. Mizuki nodded and went inside, being pulled into another room by Anna as soon as she had gotten close. Anna closed the door behind her, listening for any movement before turning to Mizuki. “Anything mistress?”“Well, she seems nice and pleasant! Although, her attire could use a bit of spoofing up…”“I mean as in how she is your daughter.”“Oh right, well she mentioned that a storm gave her powers, but beyond that, she seemed just as clueless. Oh! Did you know she has her very own village?”“Focus, Mistress,” Anna said. “Have you ever made a storm that could turn someone into a deity?”“I don’t remember! At least, maybe I made one accidentally?” Mizuki said shrugging.“Then let us kick her out!” Anna said. “Who’s to say she is even a deity? She’s just a slimeball in a fancy dress!”“She was abandoned Anna. I can’t just let her leave like that. We could be the first people she could connect with!”“Mistress-” Mizuki put her claws on Anna’s shoulder, staring into her soul through her eyes. “We are keeping her here.”“Yes Mistress…at least have her prove she has your powers,” Anna suggested.“Fair enough, it would be dumb to take someone at their word.”“I cOuLdN’t ImAgInE tHaT.”“Save the sarcasm for when I am proven right,” Mizuki said, going back outside. Tamiko was getting her hair done by one of her guards, which was a bit strange since the slime was ultimately her body in the end. “Tamiko!”“Yes, mother?” She said softly, a flower being adorned on her head.“While I trust you, I just cannot accept that you are a deity without proof. You have to do more than a simple story to prove your connection to me,” Mizuki said. “Although I am sure you aren’t lying to me.”“It is alright, I understand mother,” Tamiko said. “After all, what is a deity without integrity?~” Right after she said that A storm formed in the sky, clouds pooling together until it became one dark gray mass that pushed aside the eternal snowstorm. The snowflakes were quickly replaced by rain that turned into steam as they crossed into the shrine’s airspace. Mizuki looked at the storm and Tamiko, nodding to herself while it rained. “Well, I am convinced,” she said confidently. Rather, she seemed more relieved that she didn’t have to turn Tamiko away, breathing a sigh of relief. “It is settled then! We shall be deities together!”“Brilliant!” Tamiko said. “Mother and daughter, side by side, ruling our lands as gods, maybe even the world!”“Or just the forest...” Mizuki suggested.“Of course, we can’t go too off the path just yet,” Tamiko said. She turned around back to the shrine, looking at the building with wonder. “Although, this place is a bit too humble for someone of your status, isn’t it?”“I don’t think so,” Mizuki said. “It has always been this size…”“Well, you don’t want to seem weak, do you?” Tamiko asked.“Weak?”“Small, humble. We are chosen one’s of nature, and our living quarters should represent that, or else the humans may think different!”“L-like, a new coat of paint?” Tamiko thought about it, looking at the minka through a tiny frame she makes with her fingers. “No no no….I envision something much larger, fufufu~”
  
    Chapter Text
    For once, everyone in the picnic club had finally gotten back together! Nabu and Marsaw were back from their business trip, Mizuki and Anna had nothing that came up, and even Mervana took a break from her duties for a quick visit; not that the snow stopped, her kitsune-bi was more than capable of covering for a few hours. At least with a spirit, it was light enough to see the moon through the thin snowy clouds. The location of choice, however...was a new one.Sana was the first one to visit Mizuki’s new home, a towering red temple that rose far above the tree lines of the forest. She had never visited her shrine before, but she never thought that all this space would be needed for just two people. When she landed, she was greeted by blue Nureonagos dressed as maids, taking her guitar and putting a kimono over her since she was a guest. “How strange,” Sana commented, thanking them before going up the stairs inside. The maids lead her through the main hall, a theater-sized corridor filled with pillars. Each one had a golden dragon and a blue, splashy line spiraling up to the ceilings. It was also completely empty, save from two fancy seats near the front, and a stone circle in front of those chairs.What is with large rooms and thrones, Sana thought to herself as she was taken past it up to the next level, and then the next, and then the next. Eventually, they emerged onto the roof, where Mizuki and Anna were setting up the food and blanket. “Buddies!” Sana said, giving both of them a hug.“Hey,” Anna said, giving a quick side hug back. “Pretty impractical to have a picnic on a roof hmm?”“If I knew, I would have just flown to the top,” Sana said, looking around the floor. The roof was tiled with stone slabs, and surrounded by a wooden waist-level fence painted as red as the building. Beyond that, was a view of the mountainside, seeing the white knolls grassy hills to the north stretch to infinity. “This is quite different from what I was told…”“It’s different from what I imagined as well,” Mizuki said. She had turned around, looking out towards the snowfall empty-mindedly. “I had such a nice rock garden as well…”“We could make her restore the old shrine,” Anna suggested.“No no, this shrine works just as fine…I can always tend to the new garden on the fourth level,” Mizuki resonated, poking around the basket. Anna stayed quiet, having already told Mizuki her view earlier.“Soo….it is a bit chilly up here, isn’t it?” Sana said, trying to break the silence. “I do not exactly have winter wear…”The latch to the roof opened, Mervana coming through onto the surface. “You have a kimono, don’t you? Whoever gets cold in a kimono?”“I’m not made for winter like you are, Mervana.” The kitsune chuckled, hopping over and sitting beside Mizuki. “Hi, it’s been a while~” Mizuki nodded. “More like half a season…”“Well, what can I say,” Mervana said. “I had Arkayda prepare a basket, do you know where your kitchen is? I know it’s where you keep the donations…”“Yes, well, we have a cellar now. Tamiko thought keeping food in the kitchen was for, ahem, mortals…”“That sounds dumb as shit,” Mizuki’s shadow went. Namaru came up through it, using Mizuki’s shoulders to pull herself out of the void. “Where else would you keep the food, the roof?”“No cursing around the Ryu,” Mervana said. “Or any of us for that matter, where are your manners?”“The same place I keep my love and affection, my ass.” Namaru hopped onto the fence, walking along its top as she looked downward at the ground. “I never knew you and Anna lived like queens. Almost makes me want to steal this place for myself as well! Who is the maid?”“As of now, the slime maids,” Anna said.“How quaint! I will definitely be over here more often.” Nabu hopped over and slide down the roof, stopping herself against the edge of the panels. “Seika is arriving now too.”Seika took the longest to come up to the roof, but when she did, the echidna had been stuffed into the same kimono as Sana. “Those prudes!” She complained as a servant carried her tail the rest of the way onto the roof. “Apparently my normal attire was ‘too dirty’ to wear in the shrine.”“You wear a bra and cloth around your waist,” Anna mentioned.“No one said anything before. Mizuki, these new rules are ridiculous, I demand your ways be changed back to what they were like before!”“Maybe she just doesn’t want us to be cold,” Mizuki said. “It could only be for the winter.”“It better be! I already feel like I am sweating in this material,” Her sole servant started fanning her, having kept a large leaf under their cloak.The last ones were Nabu and Marsaw, Marsaw carrying Nabu up to the roof so they wouldn’t have to take the long way up the stairs. “Hoot!”“I know, I appreciate the effort,” Nabu said. Marsaw dropped Nabu from her claws onto the rooftop. “What did I miss?”“Nothing, we wanted to wait for everyone to arrive,” Anna said. “Now we can start eating! Mistress, you had something you wanted to say?”“Right…I wanted you all to meet someone,” Mizuki said, getting up.“Is it this Tamiko person that you have mentioned?” Mervana said. Mizuki nodded, excusing herself off the roof. “Please wait here!” She said, climbing down into the floor below. She emerged back up with her guest, err, host of honor. “Ladies, this is my daughter, as you name you might already know!” Mizuki said, the Nureonago bowing to her group of friends. “I am pleased to meet all of your acquaintances.”The resulting greeting was mixed across the board, to say the least. Only Mervana said hello back, while the rest just stared on out of distrust or suspicion. Namaru and Sana avoided eye contact like the plague, each wondering if the rest of them would do the same.“Well don’t all hug me at once….” Tamiko said, giving a nervous laugh while tugging her sleeves. “Mother, they seem a bit silent for the most part.”“It must be the weather, I’m sure they are just as excited as I am! You can even join us for when we gather together!”“I, simply, cannot wait!” Tamiko hugged her mother, staring at each one of them while she was faced the other way. “And I hope you all feel the same~”“We would have to grow into it,” Nabu said warily, turning to Namaru and Sana. “You two, I just remembered, I had business to attend with you.”“We do?” Sana said.“Of course we do!” Namaru said. “We forgot to renew our licenses for the association.”“But we don’t have li-” Namaru turned Sana into a shadowy servant before she could ruin the ruse, then turned Nabu as into as one as well. “You understand Mizuki? Wouldn’t want the scrooge of the higher council on our case. Well, more than usual.” Mizuki turned around and gave a thumbs up. “Of course! I know Anna hates her as well.”“Not hate, I just would rather not be around her,” Anna said. Namaru nodded and jumped into one of the shadows, traveling away with both shadow-sized yokai in tow.“What is a higher council?” Tamiko asked.“Only the most prestigious positions in the association,” Mervana said, taking out her pipe. “I wouldn’t go for it though, it’s a drag.” Tamiko sat beside Mervana, intrigued by the existence of such a title. “Hmm...Tell me more.”Namaru chose a good spot in the forest before sitting down, turning Nabu and Sana back into their normal selves, Sana fell over, holding her stomach while catching her breath. “So cold…”“Warn us next time you are going to do that,” Nabu said, waiting for the feeling to come back in her fingers. She cleaned her glasses with her clothing in the meantime. “Now then, we all know why we really left, correct?”“Yes, but um, to make sure…it is about Tamiko right?” Sana asked.“Yes!” Nabu and Namaru said.Sana: “Good, good. I know I have seen that slime before!”Nabu: “We all have. I never would have expected her to bed up with Mizuki though…”Namaru: “We need to tell her. She’s harboring a criminal!”Nabu: “We can’t, it wouldn’t work. Mizuki would never believe us…”Sana: “We don’t know that, maybe there is a slim chance it could work?”Namaru nodded in agreement. “Exactly, and I don’t want to spend ten chapters on something that can be done by the end of today. We go in, and one way or another, that slime is leaving.”They all nodded in agreement and went right back through the void, landing in the middle of everyone eating. Tamiko had made a little chess board for all of them to enjoy, with Seika playing against one of the maids. “Oh, you all have come back!” Tamiko said, gesturing to the board. “Would you fancy a game, I picked up the concept from the humans.”“Shut up,” Namaru said, un-shadowing Nabu and Sana. “Mizuki, your “daughter” tried to kill me a few months ago. Kick her out.” Mizuki looked up from her bowl of pasta, making a confused noise with a mouthful. “Hmm?”“Namaru, have tact. You can’t just say that with no buildup!” Nabu said.“That is quite the accusation to make as well,” Tamiko said, placing a hand on her chest. “I would never do something like that! Do you have me confused for another slime?”“You just did a month ago!”“You also attacked Vargas too!” Sana piped in. “And me, and his husband!”“I have reports matching your description, I cannot say you’re completely innocent Tamiko,” Nabu said. Mizuki looked about ready to say something, but Seika cut her off before she could finish her mouthful. “But what if it really wasn’t her?” She asked. “All I have heard that it was a Nureonago.”“I have no record of any yokai from the species. I would know if it was a shapeshifter as well,” Nabu said, looking straight at Tamiko. The slime’s eyes narrowed as they stared at each other, daring the Hakutaku to try anything.“I did think it was kind of weird that Mizuki’s powers could turn someone into a yokai,” Anna said. “I never liked her either way Mistress, with all due respect.”“Wha...but...Tamiko wouldn’t hurt a fly!” Mizuki said putting her bowl down. “She has done nothing but good for us ever since she came…”“I see nothing wrong with her either,” Mervana said. “Then again, I have no idea what is happening.”“Well the rest of us don’t trust her Mizuki,” Nabu said, stepping to the side. “It is either us or her,” Namaru added.Nabu: "Now Namaru...."“Mother, don’t listen to them!” Tamiko grabbed the Ryu’s arm, clutching it tightly. “Please, they, they have the wrong yokai! I never did anything!”“I...I….I choose Tamiko,” Mizuki hesitantly said, hugging her daughter. “You three, just came out of nowhere…”“I would just like to say that your own maiden doesn’t like her,” Namaru tries.“Anna doesn’t like anyone and tomatoes!” Mizuki retorted back. “If you don’t have any proof, then stop attacking my daughter!” Nabu turned to Namaru, giving her that ‘I told you so look’.“Don’t look at me, you try having an attempt on your well-being,” Namaru said. “I don’t have to take this, I’m going home.” She stepped behind Marsaw and sunk behind her, disappearing from sight.“I suppose the mood is sort of ruined…” Nabu said. “Should the rest of us go as well?”“No please, I assure you we can still have a good time!” Tamiko said, getting in the center of the picnic floor. “Does anyone fancy a show? I know my maids can do a bit of theater.”“It’s alright,” Mizuki said. “We can just reschedule, some other time…”“Preferably at the resort,” Mervana said. It’s more convenient for me that way.” Everyone else silently agreed and took their respective leaves; Mervana started to leave, but Tamiko hath managed to grab one of her tails before she could begin her travels back. “Please, you at least don’t go.” Tamiko shuffled back a bit when she saw Mervana turned around, her left eye glowing blue as she looked at the slime with animosity. “You dare touch the Snow Deity’s sacred tails?” “I humbly apologize! But, I have an urgent question. About the higher council.” Once she let go, the glow left and Mervana’s chill face came back, her eyes closing as she took out her pipe. “Fine, but let us head inside. No one is on this roof anymore.”“So, you wish to be on the higher council?” Mervana asked, smoking her pipe. “Even though you just became a yokai?” Tamiko nodded, fiddling with her hand fan in her hand. “If I hope to live up to my mother, I must take on a bigger role.”“And you believe getting on there would further this goal to appease someone that needs no appeasing?” Tamiko nodded again, getting an eye raise from Mervana. “I will never understand anyone in the Yokai Association,” she admitted. “But, if you are serious, you have quite the hurdle to get through.”“With my abilities, no hurdle should be unbeaten!”“If you say so.” Mervana sat straight up, stuffing her pipe back in her kimono. “You should know that there are two ways you can get on the Higher Council. The first is through recommendation and being polled in.”“That sounds easy!”“Do you have ten years and a vacant position you are expecting?”“Nevermind, what is the second option?”“Proving yourself, also my favorite option. Essentially, if you know a person that can test your abilities and character-”“Then I can show that I am worth material!” Tamiko said out loud, hitting her fist in her palm. She caught a side glare from Mervana, sitting back down. “My apologizes.”“I wasn’t done talking…”“You don’t need to. When others see what powers I have, they would definitely accept me as one of them!”“And your character?”“What is there I have to hide?” Tamiko asked. “I’m merely a rain yokai, right?”Mervana tried staring into her heart with her eyes, but she couldn't make anything out. “Sure. But even if you are, it won’t be enough. Only a very select few are capable of handling the tasks of the higher council, but if you want to know about that, I would suggest asking Nabu.”“It is settled then, I wish to be taken to her immediately!”“I don’t do escorts,” Mervana said.“But I do not know where to go.”“Someone that does not know the lands by heart has no business attempting it, I hear.” Mervana’s body promptly turned into snow, morphing into a her-shaped mound of fast-melting snow. “Ciao! ”“Wait, how are you doing…” Tamiko started, unable to catch her before her body had fully been replaced with nothing but soft flakes of snow. Without her around, her demeanor shifted to a scowl, flicking open her fan while looking at the growing puddle. “Hmph, seems I need to figure out who this Nabu person is…should be easy to coerce her into giving me her position.” She extended her pinkie out, bring up a shadowy foot from the pile of snow to stop the pile down into a pancake. “After all, she would have no choice!~”
  
    Chapter Text
    Soon enough, winter left the lands and spring came into fruition. The blistering cold air disappeared once Mervana finished her relent on the mountainside, letting travelers be able to see the grass and muddy ground for the first time in forever. Although, now it was Seika’s and Sana’s time to be busy, as almost everyone was stuck indoors for the season. “The mortals crave sex,” the Echidna claimed. “And music,” Sana added on, trying to feel important (although, there are a lot more festivals in warmer weather).Mizuki seemed to be getting more traffic as well. Though summer was the prime time to get crops blessed, followers seemed to come by the armful, flocking to the new temple to be blessed. The Ryu stared from her living quarters on the 3rd floor, looking at the line that extended to the entrance.“Don’t you have to attend a meeting at the Association?” Anna asked, peering over her Mistress’ shoulder.“That’s what I am worried about,” Mizuki said, falling into her bed and pressing a pillow to her head. “I don’t know what to do Anna, I can’t be in two places at once…”Yuki then appeared out of the closet, holding up one of the scrolls for Mizuki. “No no no secretary, I wouldn’t want my followers to speak to a clone of me…”“What if Princess Tamiko were to go to the meeting instead?” A maid said, coming out of the closet as well. She caught Yuki off guard, scaring the catgirl under the bed.“I don’t know, Mistress,” Anna said. “If we to try something such as that, would it not make more sense for your daughter to cover your duties as a deity instead?”“Princess Tamiko is very confident in being able to relay you the meeting's information,” the maid said. “She is a very good listener, hu hu!” Anna arched an eyebrow at the maid, but she only got the same smile the slime servant has held ever since she came out of the closet.“That is true, it is only listening, right? Sounds certainly easier than tending to everyone lined up outside the shrine,” Mizuki said.“Mistress, does she even know how to get to the meeting?”“Ooo, we can take her! Like a field trip,” Mizuki said. “Doesn’t that sound swell Anna, a mother and daughter dropping her child off to her first gathering?”“I think you’re being delusional if you believe the association is anything close to a schoolhouse,” Anna said, crossing her arms.“Well, I think you’re just jealous since I was always better with children~. Who was the one who always babysitter the village children?”“Yeah, and who was the one that took care of them when a certain Ryu dumped off the kids to the moment one of them cried?” Anna said glaring. Yuki and the slime maid watched while Mizuki started sweating, but then excused herself past Anna. “Oh, would you look at the time, time to take Tamiko off!”“Coward!” Anna yelled as Mizuki shut the door behind her, the lamia turning back to the window. “I hate dealing with people…”The portal opened to a beach, Mizuki coming through before helping Tamiko through. “So bright!” Tamiko said, shielding her eyes from the light of the sun. “Is the beach usually this illuminated?”“That is just Amaterasu shining down on us!” Mizuki said. “Or Ganan. Come on, it seems the gathering is that way,” she said, pointing to the yokai heading down the beach. They started their walk, leaving behind footprints and a long tail print as they walked alongside the tides. “Are all the meetings held here?” Tamiko asked, rolling up her kimono so she didn’t get it wet. “It is such a clear place too…”“Nope, the location of each meeting changes each time. It would be quite stale if we stayed in one place, and sometimes it is more convenient to be in a different location for some,” Mizuki explained. They could see a raised level in the distance, and yokai gathering and sitting in haphazardly before it. There was no structure, just groups of others chatting while staying before the level.“This is about where I take my leave now,” Mizuki said, having held Tamiko’s hand the entire time. “Have you brushed your hair?”“My hair is always brushed mother,” Tamiko said. Mizuki smiled warmly and hugged her, kissing her forehead. “Of course it is, sweetie. Make sure you come back once everything is done, just a simple portal will suffice.”“Yes mother,” Tamiko said. “You’re constricting me a bit, mother…”“Just a bit longer...alright!” Mizuki let her go, waving once more before going off back the other way. Tamiko just stood awkwardly, opening her fan and fanning herself to hide her smile. “That, felt nice….”“Tamikooooo!” she held Mervana call out, the kitsune walking up with outstretched arms before bear-hugging the Nureonago from the side. “My favorite slime!”“I am sure I am your only slime,” Tamiko said, a bit annoyed her daze was spoiled. “When did you get here?”“Same as you idiot. Now then,” Mervana pointed to the raised level, where several people were beginning to settle down. “I suppose you came for them, right?”“Indeed,” Tamiko said, her attention turning to the level. There was a fiery mouse pacing around, talking to Nabu from yesterday. There were also two twinned yokai men conversing, one dawning green fox ears on his head while the other adorned green dragon horns. Lastly, a pale lady sat mid-air, wearing a dark blue kimono patterned in various periods of the moon. She was the only one silent, her eyes closed as if she was meditating. The one similarity between all of them though, was that each held a tremendous presence, radiating their own unique auras as they awaited the start of the meeting.“So prestigious…” Tamiko said. “Is that the higher council?”“In the flesh,” Mervana said. “The mouse gal that looks like she needs to use the bathroom, that is Ganan, the Sun God’s apprentice. Then there’s Nabu, I’m sure you’ve met her already…”“You have no idea…”“Those twins are the Souseiki twins. They descend from a line of some of the first yokai, and are masters in manipulating their mana,” she pointed to their heads. “The one with horns creates dragon-ki, while the one with the ears creates beastman-ki.” Lastly, Mervana pointed to the meditating one. “She is Wane, a descendant of Tsukuyomi.”“The moon god…” Tamiko said. “Does that mean that the higher council is-”“Mostly heritage, but there are exceptions. Right now, it is just Nabu, but there have been countless yokai that are not from any important bloodlines or any other titles to their name.” As Mervana talked, Nabu rang a bell to gather the attention of all the other yokai sitting in the sand. “Hello everyone,” she announced. “First, I will just like to give a toast, however, Marsaw forgot to bring the catering.”“Hoot,” Marsaw said while sitting on the side of the level.“Don’t sass me, young owl. Now then, we will just have to settle for imaginary glasses. Please raise your fictional wine, everyone, to the beginning of spring.”“To the beginning of spring,” everyone said, chuckling as they pretended to clink glasses and drink wine. “Yes yes, I am a bit funny...now then, as it is spring, it is the month that the most deities are free from their duties. However, I want all of us to pay special attention to the humans these coming few months. Their ways are developing a bit too fast, for my tastes.”“Translation, we are losing followers each cycle,” Ganan said matter-of-factly. “Yet, we can’t punish them Nabu. Why can’t we just put them in their place?”“We talked about this Ganan, that would only encourage them to leave us!”“I agree,” said Wane, opening one eye. “But, that only leaves us the change for the mortals, or at least prove that we are still necessary,”“Why don’t you all just open a resort-like I did?” Mervana piped up. The entire panel gave her cold stares, but the kitsune just kept talking. “Oh, right! The association made it illegal to have commerce with humans. Shame then.”“Do you want to keep your limbs?” Ganan asked.“I think we both know you can’t take a hair off my body,” Mervana said. “But, engaging with the humans in something other than nature would help with your problems.”“And lower our position over the humans?” Nabu said. “Our power operates through their beliefs of our mystical nature. If they saw us as a tangible entity…”“Yeah yeah, it won’t be as effective. Alas, look who is still going strong on the mountain,” Mervana said. “In fact, I bet you’re only doing this because you don’t want to admit that my ways are right.”“Youko!” One of the twins said. “You are acting out of-”“No.” Nabu cut him off, keeping line of sight with her. “She isn’t worth condemning….” Mervana only kept grinning, resting her head on her heads. Tamiko was in awe, wondering if anyone else had dared to speak up like this as well. From the looks of everyone else, like Mervana had done this before, supposedly not...“Maybe in another world, Mervana, your strategy would have merit. However, we aren’t in that world; we are in a world where a deity impurities herself by lighting tea leaves on fire to sleep.”“Going for my habits I see? That is below the belt Nabu, have you been getting sleep or has you constantly coming to my resort finally been taking a toll?”“I have, actually,” Nabu said, nodding. “But, how is the weight of those genocides holding up? Have the clans repopulated yet?” Everyone then turned onto the kitsune one last time, Mervana’s smile faltering to her chagrin. Mervana just lit her pipe in front of everyone, putting the mouth-part at the edge of her mouth. “Hmph,”“Now then…” Nabu said, continuing on with other announcements. Tamiko was just dumbfounded, her mind spinning as she was stuck on the exchange a few seconds ago. Are, is everyone just moving past that? Tamiko thought, watching as Mervana just stared off towards the sky, pleasantly-smelling smoke rising into the air. She still had plans for the council, but she needed to find out about the Youko as well...“...and last but not least,” Nabu said. “It took all winter, but thanks to your help, we have apprehended the slime girl that had been plaguing our members. It’s once again safe to travel, and no, I do not mean the Nureonago that had been sitting among us,” Nabu said. “They are similar, but...different entities.” Tamiko was confused why she wasn’t outed, but she wasn’t exactly against it. She just got up when people started to leave, starting to move towards the council. Mervana grabbed Tamiko’s shoulder beforehand though, letting the main exodus of the crowd commence, so they were surrounded for the moment.“Tamiko, are you absolutely sure you aren’t hiding anything? Mervana suddenly asked, with less energy in her words. “O-Of course!” Tamiko said, uncomfortable with how hard the kitsune was gripping her shoulder. “I just wish to talk to the council, that is a-”“We all have skeletons, Tamiko,” Mervana said. “Some hide it better than others, and others are completely okay with the blood on their hands being seen by the masses. So either you’re lying to me, or….or you have fear in your heart.” Her face looked regretful, but her voice had a completely different overtone, bouncing around in her mind like a microphone.“Fear?” She asked, the slime making contact with Mervana’s hand freezing. “Fear indeed...and if you think I am bad, then you aren’t prepared for your mother,” If a slime could sweat, Tamiko’s sleeves would have felt uncomfortably wet then. “M-my….”Right then, the crowd began to wane, as almost everyone had left the beach already. Half the council was gone as well, including Nabu. “Well then, safe trip home Tamiko,” Mervana muttered, stepping past her and wadding into the ocean. It was surreal, watching her nonchalantly walk like a spirit going back to its resting place until her hair went under the waterline. Tamiko took a slow nod, spending one last moment taking at the moment before going to the raised level. It was more like normal sand now, though, the twins stomping down the sand back to its normal height as if they were popping bubble wrap.“E-excuse me,” Tamiko said, bowing before them. They both looked up, legs paused in mid-air as they turned towards the slime. “Yes?” they said, mostly wanting to answer, so they can get back to their mindless sand popping fun.“I wish to talk to Nabu about something-” Before she could finish, the fox-eared one opened a portal to Nabu’s hall. “Hurry now, you interrupted me and my brother!”“Yes sir, sorry sir!” Tamiko said, hurrying through the portal. It closed behind her, leaving her stuck in what appeared to be a worn-down temple with pillars surrounding her. A lone stone podium stood before her, with no other hint nowhere she was.“Does the Hakutaku really live in this mess?” She wondered, hearing a hoot behind her. She turned and shrieked, pointing her fan at her. “My word, you are one creepy owl.”“Hooooooot….” Marsaw said.“I, I don’t understand you. Are you able to….do you birds speak in anything other than sounds?” Marsaw shook her head, either to say no or out of annoyance. “Whatever, I just came to see your master, no need for an owl mage.”“Hooo,” Marsaw said, flying off. “Fine! Leave and just let me be here, alone in the woods!” Tamiko kicked the podium out of frustration, the podium shaking then slipping below the floor. A stairway down appeared in place of it, the stone sliding away to the stairs going into the ground. “I see I struck gold then!” Tamiko said. “Fu fu fu, it was in front of me all along! How silly of me~”Tamiko went down the stairs, lighting her hands on fire so that she could see down the dark stairwell. The passage open up to a row of books, stretching farther than her light could stretch.“Hello?” Tamiko called out, her voice echoing as she walked down one way. “If you jump out at me, I will not hesitate to drown and char your hide at the same time…”“Did Marsaw let in a visitor?” Nabu’s voice rang. “And I have only just gotten home as well…”“You mean the owl who only knows two words? Yes, she was a real treat,” Tamiko said sarcastically, reaching the end of the bookshelf. The end she was on opened up to tables and furniture spread out.“Don’t speak ill of what you don’t know, Tamiko,” Nabu said, Tamiko getting closer and closer to the voice. “So, why have you come to my domain?”“Can’t you read my mind? You know why I would come to a place like this.”“Only when I am near enough,” Nabu said. The light had finally reached her, Tamiko seeing her lounged out on a long sofa. She looked like she had been waiting for the Nureonago, trailing her finger along the linen of the furniture. “You are probably wondering why I lied at the meeting.”“Much more than that, actually….” Tamiko said, her mind going to Mervana for a moment before coming back to the focus. “But, I wish to try out for the higher council.”“....What?” Nabu said. “You could barely handle my shadow clone, and you think you possess enough power to even have that spot?”“Mervana also said that character was important!”“You of all people, pulling the character card…” Nabu sighed, sitting up on her chair. “If you think your character is fit for it, then have you told Mizuki the truth about your past?”“Of course, I was a young, for-”“The full truth.”“....You’re not my mother,” Tamiko said, hiding her mouth behind her fan. “Why does my past even matter?”“Because you’re lying to the only person that defended you. You think she isn’t worthy of knowing?” Tamiko turned around, refusing to answer.“Suit yourself then. If you go to anyone else, you’ll fail, even before you begin.” Nabu laid back down on the chair, turning her back to her. “Come back to me when you have done what I’ve asked.” Tamiko clenched her teeth, forming a small fireball in her hand. “I think I rather stay. After all, I have the real Nabu here and all to myself!” She turned around and threw the fireball, the blast streaking towards her. It dissipated before it could touch Nabu though, dissipating from a sudden gust of wind slicing through the ball and towards the slime. Tamiko dived to the side, watching the wind blade cut through a set of chairs before losing power and disappearing.“Are you done yet?” Nabu said, Marsaw landing in front of her and raising her wings. “I rather keep my chairs in one piece today.”“Hoo!”“Seems we have different agendas then, my owl. Have fun.” Nabu took a book out from between the cushions and began reading. Marsaw shuffled and crouched, launching at Tamiko with a sheer scream. Tamiko raised hands from the shadows to trap her immediately, but the owl was no slouch in speed. In the blink of an eye, the owl mage speed up and outpaced the shadows, slashing her claws against Tamiko’s face before darting up with a flap of her wings. “You insolent- argh!” Her slimy face healed back instantly, but Marsaw was already circling, getting ready to dive-bomb her once more. Tamiko shot a column of fire up at the owl, but she dodged left and darted down to Tamiko.Shing! Another cut through the princess, this time driving a wedge through her body. She pulled herself back together once more, jumping back to make some space between, though. However, it was futile. It didn’t matter if there were 1 or 100 meters between them, the owl mage would close the distance in less than a second, driving her legs and talons right through the body of Tamiko each time. As a slime, she could take no physical damage, but each time she had to reform herself was precious seconds Marsaw could use to discombobulate her with a wall or blade of wind.“Come on!” Nabu egged on, watching with a cup of hot chocolate. She had also gotten a candle in the meantime, all comfortable while watching from her seat. “Marsaw should be an easy matchup for you. You wanted to be a councilwoman, yet you can barely handle holding off an owl who only knows two words!”“Be quiet and let me kill you!” Tamiko said, grabbing Marsaw’s claw as she flew by. Marsaw flapped, looking down as the slime slowly engulfed her leg. She instantly started her drawing, making sure to burn the leg for extra measure. “Ahaha! Without speed, you’re just some dumb bird!”“Hoo,” Marsaw said, flying herself up with Tamiko attached anyway. “W-what are you doing? I am sapping your mana! You’re not even a deity! You should be fainting right this instant!” Amidst being dragged around in circles and janked up and down, she heard Nabu laughing at her plight.“I cannot believe you haven’t realized it yet,” Nabu said, taking a smug sip of her drink. “Could you not tell? She has no powers for you to steal.” Marsaw launched Tamiko, swinging her around on her leg until she was flung into the archive wall. Her back broke into a mass of slime against it, Tamiko gasping out for air and falling back down onto the ground. Her kimono was left in tatters, pieces scattered along the ground and the rest hanging by torn ribbons on her body. Marsaw was left completely unharmed, aside from a slight burn wound on her leg. She landed back in front of Nabu, watching her stagger back up to Nabu. “Did you actually take physical damage from that?” Nabu asked, seeing Tamiko hold the side of her body while it formed back up. “So much for a slime’s body…” Tamiko stared back at Nabu, her disdain for her welling up inside her chest. She wanted to burn that patronizing look off Nabu’s face, sitting there drinking her tea without having to lift a finger.“Well?” Nabu said, expecting an answer from Tamiko. The slime wanted to keep going, but she knew it would go anywhere. At least not with Nabu’s guardian at full strength. She looked along the ground, finding her hand fan before leaving the two. She turned one last time, giving Nabu a hard scowl before disappearing into the darkness.“Hoot,”“Yes Marsaw,” Nabu said. “She is pretty insistent. However, she is never going to get onto the higher council if she thinks she could rush her ascent to power, nor force her past the ones already there.” Nabu took another sip, giving her teacup to Marsaw. “By the way, your lover's milk is nice.” Marsaw straightened up, snatching the cup away with her mouth. “Hoot!” She said, blushing as she dropped and held the cup carefully in her wings.“Oops, did I say something?” Nabu said chuckling. “I meant research subject, right?”“....hoot…” Marsaw flew away, Nabu laughing more as Marsaw flew back to her room.“What happened to you!?” Mizuki said, seeing Tamiko’s clothing destroyed. “I thought I told you to come back from the beach!”“I, I took a bit of a detour, mother…” Tamiko said.“A detour? Where did you go, the forest?” Mizuki said. “I was worried sick about you!”“With all due respect mother, I had an errand to run.”“And, what was that?” Mizuki said, putting her hands on her hips.“N-none, none of your business!”“As your mother, it is plenty of my business.”“As my mother, you’re supposed to just trust me!” Tamiko said. “I thought you were nice and forgiving, but you’re interrogating me like I did something wrong!”“You did!” Anna called out from another room through the hallway. “Mistress hurry, Herveen has been waiting on you for some time now.”“Coming!” Mizuki said, turning back to Tamiko. “Now, listen here young lady-”“Wait,” Tamiko said, grabbing Mizuki’s arms. “Mother, you know I would never do anything that would purposefully put my well-being in danger. Please, just trust me.”“But Tamiko-”“Please….” Tamiko said. “I promise, I will never disobey you again. I give you my word.”“But….well….alright, but clean yourself up, you look like you went through a den of birds,” Mizuki said, brushing the princess’s slime hair aside. She then hugged Tamiko and left her in the room to give her privacy. “Thank you,” Tamiko said, waiting until the door was closed. Her ashamed face faded to a cold but thankful stare as she started to change, “....for being so gullible.”“Princess Tamiko,” A slime maid said, appearing from under the bed. She was holding a freshly made kimono for her, handing it to the slime. “What will you do about Nabu?”“The same plan as before. Only now, I will just have to get more powerful, after all.”
  
    Chapter Text
    Weeks passed without incident. Tamiko had kept her word and stayed inside the shrine house, quietly bidding her time while handling the day-to-day tasks of the shrine. Whenever Mizuki saw her, Tamiko would greet her with a bow and a hug before moving on with her things. Mizuki always offered to help, but she would get the same response each time: “I’m fine Mother~”At the end of the day, though, it gave the Ryu the time to leisure and enjoy herself. She went out, making rainstorms and watching it drizzle over the countryside from a tall hill. She was able to draw in her rock garden, making quick sketches with her rake before smoothening the surface back out for another day. She even spent more time teaching Herveen, Anna going out with Pearl on errands while they went behind the temple.“Ms. Mizuki, how long do I have to stay in this position?” Herveen said, floating around off the air. She and the Ryu have been at it for a couple of hours now. Herveen wasn’t allowed to let her body touch the ground, relying only on her mana to sit it in the air. She wobbled and bobbed back and forth, sweat dripping down her body and falling to the ground. “I think I’m going to faint…”“Then simply stop your fainting, if you keep absorbing mana then you will be fine,” Mizuki said, walking around Herveen. “Eventually, you might fall asleep, but by then, you would awake still floating in the air. Slowly gathering power shall become an unconscious effort, and you will be able to create spells unseen before.”“Is this how you became magic?” Herveen said, slowly spinning in the air.“Oh no, I just read some scrolls!”“Why can’t I do that?”“For you to go through our entire catalog would take more time than your parents drop you off,” Mizuki explained. “Also, only deities are allowed to reach the transcripts.” Herveen groaned, righting herself and stopping her spin before she became too dizzy.“Now, then, it seems you got comfortable being in the air. I need to go make another storm, will you be alright here?” Herveen shook her head, clenching her staff as she slowly fell back down to the ground. She was out of breath, her entire body feeling dull. “Aww, oh well, I guess we could continue on the hills then.”Mizuki took Herveen to the fields tucked under her arm, gasping when she saw that Tamiko was already there. Herveen had already fallen asleep, recouping after her recent exercise. “Daughter! What a pleasant surprise,” she said, Putting Herveen on her tail, so she could hug her. Tamiko turned around and huh’ed, not expecting Mizuki to come here. “You couldn’t stay within the shrine forever, could you?”“I got a message to arrive here,” Tamiko said. “Is this where you have been coming to?”“Indeed,” Mizuki said. “It’s where I do my weather-related duties.” She gets beside Tamiko, a few clouds seeming to have followed her up the hill. “I just get such a nice view while it rains, it’s peaceful.” She sat down, the clouds gathering together above her while she chilled, moving Herveen onto her lap. “Do you get away from anything as well?”Tamiko’s mind went to Nabu, but she quickly thought of another thing to tell her. “I feel confined in my room at times,” she said. “This place happens to be the complete opposite.”“I understand,” Mizuki said. “Anna can get pretty, if I dare say, annoying to listen to.” Mizuki looked around, checking if her Shirohebi had heard that.“That is not what I meant,” Tamiko clarified. “It’s just, I need more space to hone my craft, and fewer people that could get in the way.”“Have you been practicing?” Mizuki asked. Tamiko, rather than saying yes, touched her hand against the ground. She started drawing water from the ground, pulling all the dew from the entire hill into a ball of water. Mizuki lifted her butt, letting the droplets she was sitting on collect as well while she started in awe and pride.“I learned a trick I call, ‘the water grapeshot’. Personally, I think it’s some of my best work~” Tamiko said, stuffing her hand inside the water ball. A small glow was put into the center, Tamiko then taking her hand out and putting her hands under the ball. She grunted as she got a good handle hold on the bottom, throwing it up into the air with the force of a hippo.“What a ball…” Mizuki said, watching it ascend upwards until kaboom, it blew up in an explosion of water and steam. It came back down on them, both Mizuki and Tamiko making water arches over themselves to keep themselves dry. “Hey, we both were thinking the same thing, hmm?” Mizuki said chuckling. Tamiko laughed a bit, looking at her arch. “Yes, I suppose…h-hey what are you doing?” Mizuki had come over and moved next to her, fusing their arches until they were both under one large umbrella. “I-I left because I wanted space, not because…” Mizuki sat the both of them down, watching the scenery while waiting out the rain.“I wasn’t warm to the idea of a new shrine, or all these changes at first,” Mizuki said. “But, I think I have finally gotten used to it. The view is quite lovely from above the treeline.”“Of course, I knew it was lovely. We share a connection mother, I should be able to know what you enjoy, and vise versa.”“Is knowing interests really an innate thing?”“Undoubtedly so!” Tamiko explained. “If someone is unable to tell, then that bond might as well be a failed one. Are you nervous that you don’t know what I like?”“Well, you never told me,” Mizuki said shrugging. “What do you like then?” Tamiko chuckled, waving off the question. “Oh, you are just joking, I’m sure of it!”“It’s genuine. There are things that goes unspoken, but it’s not like someone could read a mind,” Mizuki said, putting an arm around Tamiko’s shoulder. “I just wish there was something I could do…”“Well…” Tamiko thought about pulling her to her side, but the quietness, the scenery...she decided didn’t want to ruin the moment. She could always go through with her plan later. “Have you also feeling that pull?”“Pull?” Mizuki asked.“Yes, it’s strange, but the water feels like it wants to be dragged towards the left…”“Dragged…” Mizuki turned to her lap. “Oh right, my student! I’ve been teaching her quite a bit of mana manipulation.” The Nureonago turned to Herveen, watching her snooze away on her lap. “She seems peaceful, are you sure she is the cause?”“I did tell her to practice until gathering power became second nature to her body,” Mizuki said, giving Herveen a head rub on her hat. “That means she did a good job,” she said, smiling warmly. “It did take quite a bit of convincing, though.”“I am merely surprised she’s sleeping on your lap.”“Surprised?” Tamiko nodded. “Personally, I wouldn’t allow myself to be as vulnerable. You could stab her, or throw her off a cliff…”“Well, that’s the beauty of a relationship. It requires a certain amount of trust to be able to grow close with another,” Mizuki said. “She trusts me enough to go through all this harsh training, and you trust me enough to call me your mother.”“I suppose…” Mizuki picked up Herveen, forming a literal water bed under her. “Yes, and what better way to show trust than letting yourself be vulnerable? Share secrets, be under their care, and encroach their entire livelihoods to a mythical dragon and slime.” Tamiko thought about it, realizing that she was talking about them.“If an entire population trusts us to allow their food to grow, then we can share secrets and private thoughts, right?”“Do you share secrets with Anna and Mervana?” Mizuki nodded. “Mervana said she had a horrible past, but I still trust her, and if you had a horrible past…”“You would...trust me.” Tamiko sighed, looking down at herself. “Um, mother?”“Hey, the rain stopped,” Mizuki said, just noticing that her daughter’s mini talent show had finally run out of water to fall. “I wonder how Anna and Pearl are doing with Maiden training….”“Most likely using the slimes as target practice, I did make them look a bit too disposable…” Tamiko said, wondering if she should have put more effort into her servants.“Probably not, Anna said she had things to attend to,” Mizuki said. Tamiko jumped up, looking down at her. “Wait, but who is at the shrine?”“Nabu said she could ensure no humans came. Why?”“I need to go,” Tamiko said, running down the hill.“Wait! Sweetie, I can just make a portal home!”“Please do your tasks mother, I can handle it, trust me!” Tamiko yelled over her shoulder, leaving Mizuki and Herveen on the hill. “Guess it is just us now,” Mizuki commented. “What of an impromptu weather lesson, hmm?” she asked her student. Herveen didn't respond, but to be fair she was pretty knocked out.“Do you know your part, Sana?” Nabu said telepathically. She, Marsaw, and Namaru were all staying hidden in the forestry around the temple, while Sana and been the honeypot that had gone inside. She had gotten weird looks from the slimes, but since Anna had given her permission to watch the building, none of them bothered her. She wanted into the bathroom, ensuring she had privacy before responding. Yes, she thought. They can’t hear me right?“Of course not, unless you’re talking out loud while thinking,” Nabu said. “We do not need to talk to have a connection, but repeating the words out loud helps get it through...do not do that, though.”Right, Sana thought. So do I start looking around?“Not yet,” Nabu said. “We need Tamiko to be the instigator, not us.”That is stupid, why don’t we just look for proof? Namaru said. We’ve already waited too long, she could already be doing something again!“She is unlikely to keep anything so close to Mizuki, and if she finds us there, she could just play it off as us being nosy,” Nabu said. “Either she is friendly, or she slips, and we catch her in the act. Sana, just keep walking around there.” Sana nodded and came out of the bathroom, opening the door right to Tamiko. “OH, MIZUKI’S DAUGHTER, HOW ARE YOU DOING?” Sana said, jumping a foot back into the bathroom. Tamiko looked disheveled, holding muddy shoes in her hands and a few leaves in her slimy body. Her eyes were emotionless, staring at the Harpy hanging around. “So, Anna really did leave,” Tamiko said.“She said that she needed someone to watch over, the temple…” Sana said. Tamiko nodded and stepped inside the small space, closing the door behind her. “You didn’t, see anything too private, right?” Tamiko said. “There are a few spaces that are off-limits to all but the owners of the shrine…”“Of course not,” Sana said. “I would never go into somewhere like the basement or your bedrooms….” She tried to sidestep Tamiko, an arm grabbing Sana from her own shadow. I-Isn’t that Namaru’s power?“You seem in a bit of a rush,” Tamiko said, dropping her shoes in the sink. “Why?”“Well, you are cornering me….a bit...in the bathroom…” Sana said, trying to lift her leg out of the hand, but the grip was too strong. “You can understand my nerves…”“Right, right, right…” Tamiko said, relinquishing the hand. “Why don’t you come with me then? We can talk while you are here, over some tea…”“Cannot unfortunately, you understand, lesser deity conversing with someone of your stature…”“Strange, you didn’t carry that same attitude back when you hurled a grand piano into my head.”“Times….change,” Sana said.“Indeed~”“...”“...”Namaru and Nabu listened for anything else, not liking the silence. Sana, say something, Nabu said. Tell us if you want us to storm that bitch, Namaru said. Sana shook her head, getting a concerned look from Tamiko.“No? But...to what?” Tamiko said.“Erm...to staying...in this bathroom?” Sana went with it, not sure if she sounded convincing. Tamiko nodded opening the door. “Yes, we have been in here a while. After you, lesser deity.”Call her piano head, call her piano head, Namaru whispered while giggling.“Thank you, um….piano head.” I am going to die now. She saw Tamiko pause, Namaru’s cackling going off inside her head while Nabu scolded her.“P-Piano head, that is a...that is clever.” Tamiko was clearly finding words to say, whipping out her hand fan to cover her mouth. “Fu fu fu! I hope I can get such a roast for you as well.”She just took it, oh stars aha ha! Namaru said.“Hopefully not literally,” Sana said, following Tamiko. “I can’t make any promises, darling~,” Tamiko said, taking Sana down the floors to the main dining hall. It was just a round table, only able to fit six to eight people. Sana sat down in one of the chairs, while Tamiko sat down on the opposite end. Sana looked around, one of the sides of the room just being a glass expanse that showed the forest scenery.“I see you are a natural light kind of person,” Sana said, one of the slimes bring her a filled teacup. Another slime brought Tamiko the same kind. “My tree does not get this kind of lighting, so I have to keep a few candles around.”“You live in a tree?” Tamiko said, taking a sip of the cup.“Well, I am a bird first, deity second,” Sana said also taking a sip. “It is cozy.”“I could never, I need my space. Plenty of maids, everything as their own dedicated room. A princess need’s her luxury.”“I suppose so,” Sana said, finishing her tea. “This does taste like royalty too.” Do you have any more?”“Of course, help yourself,” Tamiko said, also getting another cup. “This tea has quite a bit of history and prestige. It is a popular drink used when diplomats or kingdoms with tense relationships meet together,” she explained while Sana took another sip. “Drinking the tea is seen as a sign of trust and merriment. One, because the leaves used to calm the mind, and room subsequently.” Tamiko took a sip of her own, emptying half the teacup. “Secondly, it has an odd quality, one that allows secrets to, just, slip out of someone.”“Slip out?”“Indeed,” Tamiko said. “So to reject it not only means that you are being a bit rude, it also means that you perhaps could know its effects, and have something to hide from the other~” Sana stopped drinking, swallowing the last gulp. Tamiko narrowed her eyes, taking another sip from her glass. “However, that does not mean that it is a given. At the end of the day, truth-seeking tea is as much of a superstition as a deity to mortals…yet, it rarely, rarely fails~”“But, then why would the host drink it?” Sana said, keeping her eye contact while clutching the drink.“A show of trust, and a claim that they have no skeletons to hide. So Sana,” Tamiko asked, learning over. “Is, there anyone else with you?”“That is a strange question,” Sana said. “Why would I come here with another?”“Because, I think you came here to set me up,” Tamiko said. “What could you be possibly supervising on a residential floor?” Sana looked down at the table, thinking up an answer. “Milling around, I suppose…”“For what?”“I don’t know!” Sana said. “I’m just a bird shrine-sitting!”“Then why can I see Namaru laughing behind a tree!?” Sana stood up and looked out the window, afraid that she had been caught. “Wait, she isn’t there…” Two of the slime maids grabbed each of her wings, holding her captive. Tamiko slow-walked over to her, her soft demeanor completely gone by this point.“A truthful person wouldn’t have looked,” Tamiko said, her shadow being engulfed in shadow mana. “But that’s alright, I can just keep you until your friend’s come.”“Fine then,” Sana said, trying to wring her wings out of the maids’ grip. “Turn me into a shadow servant! I won’t care, but Mizuki might be wondering how you have someone else’s powers!”“If it was still winter, you might have been right,” Tamiko said. “But, after my meeting with Nabu, I realized that she was right.”“That you’re a manipulative killer?”“That I wasn’t powerful enough, thank you very much!” Tamiko punched Sana in the gut, getting a squawk out of her. “That was for calling me a piano head earlier, and this~” She paused, starting to choke her with her engulfed hand. Sana could feel something being burned into her neck, Tamiko holding her there for a minute until letting go and letting her slump back into the slimes. “This is for thinking I wouldn’t notice your trickery. Let her go,” she commanded, the maids. “Now then, how to break you before mother gets back~”The door to the dining room breezed open, four other slimes forcing in Namaru and Nabu. “N-no, run away!” Sana said, her body feeling heavy as she tried to get up. “She is too powerful!”“What did you do to her?” Nabu said with urgency.“You bastard, let us go!” Namaru yelled, stepping on one of the guard’s feet. Of course, it didn’t work, mostly because a slime very rarely felt physical pain. Tamiko obliged by their wishes, snapping as the two were pushed down in front of her. She didn’t let them get up, Tamiko immediately doing the same grip she did to Sana that she did to Nabu. Namaru and Nabu grunted, grinding their teeth while the branding sensation fired off on their neck. “No need to waste my time monologing,” Tamiko said. “I could have blundered my whole plan.”“Why, why does my shadow burn…” Namaru said, standing up on unsteady legs. She felt like she had a fever, sweating while the sensation lasted.“Like it? I had to figure out something that not even you can counter,” She held out her fan, motioning it down towards the ground. “Kneel~”“Fuck o-” Instantly, the weight of a mountain fell on Namaru, her body getting on one knee without her will. “Ah, watch it with my legs!” she said, her knee slamming into the ground with too much force.“Oh, sorry. I haven’t exactly polished my power yet, but with you three, I will have plenty of practice from now on~” she said, three shadowy leashes all appearing in her hand, connected to a collar on each person’s neck. She turned to Nabu, who had her face down ever since being pushed to the ground. “What of you, higher council member? You have talked so much, yet here you are, kneeling down to an exceptionally dressed slime.” Nabu stayed silent, her head not moving. “Why are you so silent?” Tamiko said, tugging on her leash. “Is the shame of this that hurtful to your pride?”The Hakutaku started laughing. It started as a low, small tickle in her throat until it slowly crescendoed into a belly-filling laugh that reached the corners of the room. Tamiko, off-put by the laughing, kicked her hard in the face, knocking her hat off in the process. “You buffoon! Why are you laughing?”“You really thought that we would fall so easily to your guards?” Nabu said, staring up at her with a now-bloody nose. "Haven’t you noticed?” Nabu said, raising her hand. Her fingertips were melting into blue slime, the blue taking over her hand. “What?” Tamiko said, looking at Namaru. Her hands were also turning blue, along with her hair. No! They couldn’t have! Tamiko looked up at the guards, noticing that one had gone missing. She turned around, narrowly dodging an attack from one of the guards.“That’s right, we have duped you with the bodies!” Nabu yelled, laughing as the other three guards went to attack. Tamiko evaded, jumping over them and raising walls of fire to stall while she tried to keep up. That doesn’t even make sense! Unless...Nabu’s powers, she must have found a Yokai that turns herself into a slime! Tamiko thought, getting kicked in the back by one that had sunk up behind her. I barely have time to think,” She said, forming a dome of fire around herself. The slimes punched through, their first steaming from each hole they put into the barrier. But why are their four? What power could Nabu have...wait. The last time I met her, she was able to control shadows… She raised a leg as one of the slimes punched upward through the floor, Tamiko expanding the barrier then going back to running. For all her training, she never expected her own guards to be used against her. Two of them, they must be shadows! Which would mean that the two on the ground are my own maids! Both her hands started to glow black once more, making a beeline towards the maids. Even still, I can’t enslave all 4 bodies like this, maids, please help and forgive me! She grabbed both “Nabu” and “Namaru”’s necks again, quickly getting rid of the collars around their neck before running once more. Nabu and Namaru instantly subdued the four slimes, Tamiko applying her collar on them once they were down for the count.“Ahahah!” Tamiko said, followed by the two and the guards behind Sana. “You thought you could outsmart me, but I outsmarted your outsmarting! It does not matter if it takes 10 seconds or a 100, I have still caught all three of you,” she said, patting both Nabu and Namaru on her back. “Don’t worry, my lovelies, I’m sure the mana used will wear off within the moment.”“I am not sure about that,” Nabu said. Tamiko’s victorious smile switched up once more, but this time out of panic. Nabu looked past Tamiko to Namaru on the other side. “Do you feel like you will turn back, Namaru?”“Not really, I fact….I think I like this newfound freedom.” Tamiko instantly reached back towards Nabu and Namaru’s necks, but this time, they were ready for her attempts. Nabu grabbed her wrist out of sheer speed, while Namaru’s shadow snagged her arm midair. “I never would have guessed Nabu, using my own shadow in ways I never knew….”“It is the other perk of mana-sutiru. You are able to innovate the powers you gather, but, at the cost of being the progenesis of a new yokai type.” Nabu held up her other hand, strings shining in the natural light. Tamiko followed them back to the guards behind them, seeing a limb move each time Nabu wiggled a finger. “Nature does not like many abilities concentrated to one person, so nature shall create balance by forming the ability in other yokai. This is one of mine.”“You were controlling them?” Tamiko said, feeling a mix of hopelessness and befuddlement. She had spent so long training off-screen, yet never made a contingency for if her newfound powers didn’t work. Her talent had been predicted and countered over the board, and now she had no tricks left up her large sleeve.“Yes, and as such, I shall now bear the burden of providing the ones after my guidance. That is the fate of nature’s chosen. It’s why I decided to be the Yokai’s Association’s archive and censor. When your destiny is part of your job, it becomes a lot easier to fulfill it.” Nabu tapped Namaru’s elbow, freezing the joint. “Now, I did promise that you would get a cheap shot in once we figured out her power. My advice, a nose for a nose.”“Oh Nabu, you old-fashioned goat,” Namaru said. “It isn’t cheap if you almost died.” With that, she gave the Nureonago one hell of an elbow to the face, freezing on contact with Nabu’s ice, then shattering it with the force behind her arm. She sent Tamiko flying off, landing on her back holding her nose. Namaru walked over and picked her right back up, holding her by the collar of her kimono. “You self-righteous, undignified, daughter of a whore…” Tamiko said through a broken nose.“Thank you, I like when my enemies are groveling on the ground.” Nabu came over and grabbed Tamiko’s wrist, activating her power. She put her hand around Sana’s neck, Sana gritting her teeth as the collar got removed. She coughed a couple of times, getting up now that she was finally allowed to. “It took you long enough,” Sana said, seeing Namaru hold Tamiko in a rough pin. “That is the last time I ever get used as bait...where is Marsaw?”“Circling around. I am actually glad we didn’t need her,” Nabu said. “I severely underestimated how fast Tamiko could make something work. If we didn’t succeed, she could have gotten Marsaw as well. It almost makes me proud, if she weren’t without evil intentions.”“I swear, I will get you, then I’ll get that fox man once and for all, then I will sit upon Amaterasu’s mantle myself! You’re just a hurdle in my master plan!”“Tell that to the judge, jury, and executioner,” Namaru said.“Actually, do not,” Nabu advised. “A younger Ganan would beat someone to a pulp for forgetting to say hello. She has calmed down now, but I can’t imagine what would be going through her head seeing you here, especially after kicking you through half a forest.”And thus was the probable end. Tamiko could see no way out of this that didn’t involve having to power her way through three- alright two, Sana is kind of usel- no wait three yokai, since Marsaw could come at any moment. The only thing to do now was to marinate in her own failure. At least it couldn’t possibly get more embarrassing, Tamiko thought, not self-aware enough to realize what kind of movie she was living. Spoiler, it wasn’t the good kind people talk about on Instagram. It was the bad kind, where the only person that would probably vouch for you at this point is about to come and see the fallout of your havoc.

    “Did you drop off Herveen and Pearl?” Mizuki said, walking back up the forest with her trusted Shirohebi. Anna nodded, a basket of fruits swaying gently in her hands. “It was nice for the mom to give us food, but, aren’t these demon fruits?”“We technically are demons,” Mizuki said, picking up one that looked like a grape, but was translucent and purple. “So demon grapes.”“I rather keep my purity, thank you,” Anna said. “I still want to toss the basket.”“You can give it to someone, but tossing it would simply be rude,” Mizuki said. “Even if they would not see it happen.”“Yet, giving it away is allowed?”“We are just passing it along, wink wink,” Mizuki said, winking twice.“That is not how you do a double wink.”“Wot?”“You are not supposed to wink and say ‘wink’ out loud. It is poor taste.”“I was obviously joking,” Mizuki said. “Wait, where are we going?”“Walking back home, obviously,” Anna said, stopping. Mizuki also stopped, looking at the ground beneath her then back at Anna.“Yes, but why are we walking?”“I do not know, Mistress, I am not the Ryu in charge.”Mizuki pouted and opened a portal to the roof of the temple, Anna clutching the basket so it didn’t blow away in the wind. “Mistress, is it me, or is this place a bit breezy today?”“It could be a wind spirit or yokai,” Mizuki said, looking up and around. She saw Marsaw hovering above, blowing gusts of wind to them with her wing flaps. “Or just one poofy bird.”“Where is your Mistress, Marsaw?” Anna called to her, Marsaw coming down and landing beside them. “Hoot.”“Right, you don’t speak words.” Marsaw went over to the roof latch, opening it with a talon. “Hoot.”“Yes! She can show us where she is, if that is what she means,” Mizuki said, putting a finger on her chin. “But, why would Nabu be inside?”“That is my question since I asked Sana of all people to watch over…”The two of them entered the temple, following Marsaw down the steps. She came to the dining-room door, knocking against it with her wing.“But we already had our food,” Mizuki said. Marsaw opened the door, showing the scene that had taken place. Tamiko looked distraught, her head jerking up when she heard the click of the door. Mizuki walked in and froze, seeing all the slimes immobilized on the floor, Nabu and Sana resting and bit Injured, and Tamiko subdued completely. “Ah-”In an instant, Tamiko saw her last chance to possible escape, and as stacked as it seemed right now, she wasn’t going to let it be squandered. “Mother!” Tamiko said, tears welling up in her eyes. Anna, not wanting to be a part of this, decided to leave for the moment.“Daughter! What are you all doing to her?” Mizuki cried, coming over and pushing Namaru off of her. “Hey, what are you doing?” Namaru asked after being shoved aside.“I should be asking you the same question,” Mizuki said, clutching Tamiko tightly while she cried. “Sneaking in and trying to harm my daughter? That is a new low, even for you!” She looked at Sana and Nabu. “And you two! Nabu, I trusted you, but now, after all this?” Nabu stared blankly, blood still slowly rolling out of her nose. Sana clutched her throat, confused about which side the Ryu was on. “She tried to enslave us,” She said, her voice still hoarse from the collar.“And kill us, and me, again!” Namaru said. “If anything, she should be put on trial!”“Enough with the accusations, I’ve lived with her since last year, and I have never seen any proof of anything you all are saying!”“Had she ever told you where she went during the last meeting?” Nabu asked, casting a side glance at Tamiko. Tamiko’s tears stopped momentarily, stunned by the prospect that she still hadn’t said anything to Mizuki. Before Mizuki could answer, Tamiko turned her mother around, facing her away from the group. She was frantic on the inside, trying to contain the damage. “Don’t listen to anything she says, she’s still trying to frame me." Tamiko then went on the other side, seeing Mizuki's face staring at the window distressed. "That day was not important at all, I just had an accident, I swear on my very powers…”"Right, an accident..." Mizuki repeated unconvincingly. Tamiko pushed harder, the tears running down her face in abundance. "I know what it looks like, but mother, please. I would never keep something from you! What they are saying, is not true!“Sweetie,” Mizuki started to ask, “We’re mother and daughter, right?”“Of course!” She responded instantly.“And that means...we share a special bond, right?” Mizuki said, seeming to search for words as much as her daughter.“Undoubtedly!” Tamiko hugged Mizuki, her cheek smushing against her front. “Then…” She started, sliding Tamiko’s arms off. “If that day wasn’t as important, you should be able to tell your mother about it, right?”"Well..." Tamiko wasn't as assertive her eyes darting away. “I, can’t trust you if you won’t say anything,” Mizuki said. “Please, tell me if you really are innocent.”“I am…”“Then why did you look so hurt that day? Why do all four of you look like you have fought a war in one afternoon? And what are you hiding from me?” Mizuki clutched her daughter’s hands. “I promise, won’t be mad.”Tamiko started sentences but kept cutting herself off as she realized. Even if she did lie, Nabu was still here, and probably had another plan for the moment her silver tongue went into action. At least, Tamiko thought she did. “Well...” Tamiko started, looking down. 
  "I wasn’t some homeless girl that was unloved. I didn’t go day to day wondering when my next meal would be, or if someone would ever take pity on me and become my guardian. I had two loving parents, and a loaf of bread and stew to eat every day."

  "Although, my mom and dad would constantly tell me everything that I did wrong. ‘Don’t start a fire in the house,’ they said. ‘Remember to feed the goat’, they said. ‘Why are you always reading in the dark? You will get your eyes taken’, they said."
“I just want to say, your eyes could have very well be taken by a Yokai,” Nabu pointed out. Tamiko looked at her with disdain. “Would you let me tell my own life? You have already won,” Tamiko said irritated. Nabu apologized and bowed her head, and the Nureonago took a deep sigh before continuing.
  "
  I know now that those were just normal, mother and father things to tell to a daughter, but it just happened so, so often…that, I started lying. It was small at first, but it seemed to work so much that I started doing it too often. For once, they did not pick on every little thing I did, and I didn't have to hear so much bickering."

  "Then one time, my father wanted me to go deliver a wagon full of fruits to a customer. He thought that since I was doing so well, I could be trusted with what would pay for most of our food. When he found out that I lied about doing it and I had lost the gold…"
She trailed off, her voice seeming to hit a brick wall. For possibly the first time, a real drop of sorrow left her eye. "Go on, it's okay," Mizuki said. "We are all here for you." I'm not, Namaru thought to herself. Nabu and Sana gave her side glares, and she folded her arms and stayed quiet."...I decided that I wasn’t going to take it anymore. So, I left. It was a rough time, but I was able to lie to people to get by, until the guards found out about me, and then I was just shunned completely. I felt so hopeless then," she said, looking at her slimy hands. "Powerless, alone, and close to just dying from hunger. I hated it, I hated everyone, and I hated the world for giving me this terrible, horrible life. And the world listened."“I see,” Mizuki said. Tamiko nodded. "The storm part, it really was true, but I wasn’t accepted after that. I never gave my old village the time to even try, before I had it washed away into the horizon…"
  "It felt freeing, in a morbid way. I made all my problems go away with one flood. All it took was me becoming a demon in the process, but I didn’t care. I was a deity, and I had the power to do whatever I wanted...”
Sana: “And then you went after Amaterasu’s Son.”Namaru: “And then me, which I will keep yelling until the end!”“And you roped me into the process,” Mizuki said, rubbing her temple with one of her claws. “My head hurts…”“I didn’t mean to hurt you; well, I did back then, but now, I realized that you were the only person that truly cared about me,” Tamiko said. “Please mother, I will do whatever you wish, I don’t want to lose the only family I have left.” Mizuki turned away and went to an empty part of the room, having curled up into a ball with her tail. “Mother.” Tamiko urged on, following putting her hand on a part of her tail. “ I know you can’t forgive me, but tell me what I can do for retribution.”“For one, you can hide your diary better,” said someone at the door. “Everyone turned to Anna,” who was holding a generic-looking notepad. “My Diary!” Tamiko yelled. “Please, don’t read it, my thoughts are too-““Too late,” Anna said, tossing Tamiko the pad. “My lips are sealed.”“What?” Tamiko said, catching it.“At least you through a few mortals in the process,” Anna said. “We have all been there, at our point where our dismay for humanity makes us due to things that we normally wouldn’t as human beings.”Everyone seemed to agree, except the Gandharva who looked on with a disgusted face, wondering what happened when she was not around. “Well except Sana it seems,” Anna said nonchalantly. “But, the difference is, we each have someone in our lives that reigns in our tendencies. Nabu has the goddess of the sun, Namaru has her, erm,”“Pet.”“I am not using that word,” Anna said, “And now, we both have Mizuki. That is if she forgives you.” Anna went over to Mizuki, tapping her shoulder. “Mistress?”“Hrm?” Mizuki said, her noise muffled by her mouth pressed against her scales.“Your daughter wishes to make up with you.”“Nmmhmm,” Mizuki said.“What if she goes through the trial?” Anna asked. “It is only right to face repercussions at the highest level, isn’t it?” Mizuki thought about it and nodded. “Well, there is your answer,” Anna said. Tamiko looked back at Mizuki once, and nodded, going to Nabu. She held her hands out, keeping her wrists closed together. “I wish to turn myself in,” she stated with a new resolve in her gleam.“Finally,” Nabu said, seeming to sink onto the floor feeling lighter than before. “You have no idea how much those words are pleasing to hear...”­­­­Tamiko spent the next three moons stuck in a room at Amaterasu’s house. While she didn’t resist the entire time, any other place was considered too easy for her to power her way out of, so why not go overboard and make her have to go through Ganan.Of course, Ganan was highly disappointed when she was told she couldn’t punish her herself, as well as when Tamiko turned out to be highly docile in her cell. The first time Vargas saw her, he avoided that hallway like a plague, having recovered from the effects of her power and unwilling to risk it again. Virto was also nowhere to be seen, although he would rarely be the one that brings her food to her.“So, do slimes eat?” Virto curiously asked while bringing her dinner.“No,” Tamiko said.That was the most interaction she had for a while. She did her hardest to make sure all that happened was self-given, refusing to come out early; even when Amaterasu had grown tired of keeping her in a bedroom without any sunlight.Then came the day of the trial. According to everyone, it was the first one that had been had in generations, so it was very impromptu put together. The Judge’s stand was hastily crafted by Nabu since all the forest Yokai were busy fixing up the lands for summer. The defendant’s seat was just the living room couch. Virto volunteered to put together the gavel but accidentally made a mallet instead.It’s safe to assume not even Amaterasu remembered how to do this properly.“My son-in-law promised to show me these so-called “Olympics” this week, so let us make this quick, shall we?” Amaterasu said Tamiko nodding. Everyone else wasn’t in the room, leaving just the two of them face to face. Even if she was about to die, Tamiko was kind of disappointed. She had always thought of the sun goddess as an elegant, eternal being that moved the sun with the grace of a ballerina, and the regality of a ruler. She had mimicked her entire public image after her, after all.She still believes in the statue, but seeing her with spa cucumbers over her eyes and her hair down and messy kind of ruins the fantasy. Wait, has she been walking around blind this entire time?“Yes, yes I have been walking around with these over my eyes,” Amaterasu said. “With great power comes a great responsibility, and a great need of a spa day, my back just aches…” Amaterasu leaned to the side, stretching until she felt a crack go up her spine. "Oh, finally...."“W-wait you can read my mind?” Tamiko said, immediately prostrating herself before her. “I am sorry my highness, I beg for forgiveness!”“Relax darling, I just do that for a bit of fun,” Amaterasu said, waving it off. “It always gets first-timers off guard, it’s so humorous. Now then, a few human lives lost don’t cause for concern, but the Yokai Association has documented quite a few infractions here…if you were anyone else, you would most likely be given the penalty of death by absorption.”“Ehhhhhh….” Tamiko had fully accepted that she could very well be screwed, but sweat started coming down her neck regardless.“However, you have been brought up with quite the special gift, I hear,” the sun goddess said, flipping through a few pages of a thin book. “It would be nice to have another Nabu around, so ending your existence would just be a waste.”“I am eternally grateful for your leniency,” Tamiko said with as much earnest as she could.“Save your gratefulness for after the sentencing. Has Nabu already informed you of the power you possess?”“Yes, your highness,”“Then you can probably guess what your punishment will be.” Without even a flick of a finger, the same collar Tamiko had created appeared on herself, making her grip her seat as she endured the pain of her ability being turned on herself. The leash was attached to Amaterasu’s hand, disappearing once completely.“Frankly I’m disappointed. Nabu had told me about this enslavement ability with the shadows, but looking at you writhe in pain, it is clear that it is too unpolished to be given out to new Yokai. Very well then. You first shall perfect your creation, and only then will you start to bring balance back to the world.”“Agh….” Tamiko stuck her tongue out, a bad taste in her mouth left by the collar. “May I asked how long this will take?”“If I told you, you would rather die. I would ask Nabu,” she said. “But, you will be allowed a few certain visitors.” The door opened as soon as Amaterasu finished talking, Tamiko turning around clutching her collar. Her eyes widened when she saw Mizuki smiling, peeking around the door in a sundress. Her cheeks flushed red, unable to contain her smile for her mother. “Am I interrupting?” Mizuki asked.Tamiko shook her head, getting up to go give her a big hug. “No,” she said. “Not at all.”

    “Anna!” Mizuki called out from the front door. She had packed a picnic for her and Tamiko to enjoy, wishing to meet her at Amaterasu’s home. “I am heading out!” She said before turning to leave.“Wait!” she heard Anna faintly cry. She stopped and turned back, hearing a rush of tail going down the stairs before Anna came zooming out through the front door. She got in front of Mizuki, blocking the way out of the shrine. “We have a problem!”“A problem? But the shrine is fine,” Mizuki said smiling. She noticed that Anna still had Tamiko's journal, with a scale of hers bookmarking one of the pages. "What is that?"“Oh, this is- that's not important! Look out in front of you!” Anna said, gesturing out towards the courtyard. Aside from them and a few housekeeping slimes, the place was completely barren.“I don’t see anything…” Mizuki said, looking around.“Exactly!” Anna said. “It is the height of summer, with Harvest Season only a season away, and there is no one coming over to request anything. Don’t you find that a bit weird?”“Your level of concern feels out of character,” Mizuki noted. “Are you feeling ok?”“I’m not saying I care about humans; I’m saying that we should be getting requests by now, and yet no one has come to visit us. It is like the humans have forgotten that we existed.”“Impossible, I am a very polite deity!” Mizuki said. “Sure, I may have missed a few days due to a few important get-togethers, but the humans wouldn’t really forget about beings so important within the span of a day.”“They are humans,” Anna said. “The bar is low for their existence to be justified.”“Well, if you really are so concerned, we can go visit our old village and see if anything has happened,” Mizuki said. “I am sure it is just a momentary lapse that will blow over as easy as a pile of leaves.”It turned out not to be a momentary lapse. When they arrived, they saw columns of steam billowing up from each house, and strange machines that farmers pushed to lay down loads of seeds without having to pick them up. A few others with books would cast spells on the seeds, growing them at abnormally high rates before more weird-looking machines would come and scoop them out of the dirt.“What is this!?” Mizuki said, dropping her fruit baskets in astonishment. She saw Vargas and Virto picnicking on a hill, immediately flying over them and landing right on their blanket. “E-explain!”“Explain what?” Vargas said, midway through chewing through a sandwich.“I think she means the industrial revolution happening right before us,” Virto said.“The what?” Vargas asked with a mouthful.“Industrial revolution, but in this world." Virto started explaining. “You see, my theory is when I created a connection between this world and my world, it created a disturbance where there were two worlds that worked in different ways and were on different timelines, and since our worlds naturally don’t like differences, they are working their way towards a sort of equilibrium where both worlds can exist while connected. For example, this world is speeding up its timeline to match up with our timeline, resulting in places that are still olden, while places like this village suddenly start creating more technology.”One would say you could literally see the loading icon spinning on Mizuki's forehead. “…..The wha?”“Oh. Right. You know how water tends to smooth out after something pokes it or splashes into it?”“Mmhmm?”“It is like that, but with ways of living.”“Oooh!” Mizuki said, seeming to understand that. “Oh…. would that mean that; the humans, they don’t need yokai anymore?”“I don’t know actually,” Virto said. "Since my portal is the only one of its kind, then this is unprecedented. I have no idea how localized or widespread the effects may be, so worst-case scenario, yes probably!”“…”“Virto-kun,” Vargas whispered, giving him an elbow.“Oh! I didn’t mean to be a downer. There is still a way to have yokai be needed, I think.”“There is?” Mizuki said, looking hopeful again.“Yep! If they are like us, just keep them off the coal and the oil in the ground. They are pretty brilliant, but the fallout is just too much of a hassle.”Loading icon again. “…fall...out?”“Don’t worry about it. I was going to start doing that anyways. Vargas’ mom already said that she will help, so once I’m done, you all will be getting traffic again,” Virto said, giving a confident thumbs up. “I guarantee it!”Just as Virto predicted (or directly caused), the traffic had started going back up. Mizuki couldn’t keep them away from the temple now, getting food and donations as much as she did when she first became a Yokai again. “This is so lovely!” Mizuki said, crouching a couple of times before jumping headfirst into a pile of tomatoes. “See Anna? I told you it would only be a blip in our activity!”“Yes, only now though, is that they all ask weird requests,” Anna said, getting another one-handed to her by one of the maids. “…someone wishes my fire to be used to power a….Mistress what is a train?”“Who cares, we’re popular again!” Mizuki said, tossing a tomato at Anna. She overthrew her hands and the tomato splattered against Anna's face, dirtying her entire upper body in the juices of a tomato. “I hate this already.”“That’s the Anna I know,” Mizuki said, laughing away as she kept playing around with all the newfound food.And they all lived happily ever after. THE END.
