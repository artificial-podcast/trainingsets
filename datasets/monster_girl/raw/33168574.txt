    “Alright, let’s do this one last time,” Virto said, extending a pointer before tapping the ground one last time. Etched into it, was a range of pictures crudely drawn in the dirt. “First, I was telepathically communicated through universes by a Lilim. So I built a machine, and through a bit of trial and error I was sucked into this universe, which is portrayed here.” He pointed to a frame of a stick figure getting sucked through a portal, which was emphasized by directional lines. “Then, I had to fend off some girl with dragon wings and tails, which is shown here. Now what I wish to know, is how this is possible!” He suddenly exclaimed. He was Virto, but he wasn’t the Virto from the short I wrote, nor is he the Virto from the writer as of yet. This is a different, yet similar Virto. An inexperienced one that hadn’t been imprinted on by the world in front of him that baffled him. His hair wasn’t long and out of place, but it short, brown, and neatly trimmed. He wore glasses for that he was short-sighted by a tiny bit. However, his lab coat was still on, meaning that it will somehow last everything that was about to unfold in front of him.The person he was explaining this to was a lesser succubus. She was unusually docile, which doesn’t seem as unusual when you look closer at her skin. It was slick with signs of sexual intercourse taking place just recently before the present. She listened while her tail wagged back and forth, the little thing behaving more like a dog’s tail rather than a prehensile tool of debauchery. “Can I tell my story now?” She asked, holding out for the stick so she can draw her own tale of origin.And so she did, grunting with a few deep drags of the stick as she sketched out how she became a lesser succubus. “There!” She said, finishing up her own crude set of panels and dropping the stick down to the ground. Virto took his seat down at the ground, staring up at the succubus as she cleared her throat. “So, as you know, my name is Kiris.”“Yes, you told me so, so many times while assaulting me,” Virto responded. “Now, can we get on with the story?”“Alright. So first, I used to be a lowly villager, a follower of the Chief God.” She pointed to the first panel, with a stick figure on his knees praying to something off the picture. “But then everything changed when a purple cloud rolled in….”____________________________________________________________________________As she reminisced, she found herself teleported back to the past, at least in her mind. She was back to her normal, human self. She was already quite busty before, but more shy than lewd. Most of her curves were downplayed by the looseness of her clothing. Most of everyone’s clothing was loose and long-sleeved to leave little skin able to be seen. Over the years the season designs have gotten better to adjust for chill and warmth, but moving about in the summer was still a slight nightmare. Today was one of those warmer days, but while she was doing her task of babysitting the village children, she felt a chill run through her body as it suddenly got windy. It didn’t feel normal, as the front came too suddenly to not raise suspicion. As she watched the kids continue to play around, she looked up at the sky.Purple clouds were rolling in, with lighting going around inside them. Her eyes widened as she connected them to the texts she read, warning of an end-times that will test the loyalty of the Chief God’s subjects. She felt herself moving around, using the promise of freshly baked bread to lure the kids inside where it was safe for them. Before she tries to escape with anyone, she first had to make sure she had tracked all of them down. Once they were all inside, she started a headcount, doing the little mental math she was taught to make sure she accounted for everyone. They still moved about her little house, mostly getting the books and dolls in a corner of a room to busy themselves with. 1..2..5...7…she finally managed to count then double-check her counting, totaling up to 17 children. She was missing one…As if on cue, she heard a scream through the noise of the household. Moving slowly at first so the kids do not get a feeling of worry, she went as fast as she could in the direction of the noise once she was far enough. She darted through the woods, her minor athletic ability leaving her clumsily avoiding overhanging branches and shrubs that tore at her clothing. It seemed dim, but the noises she followed spurred her on until they stopped. It was eerie, hearing screams,  then nothing at all. Guilt and fear were setting in as she kept running until she ran into something that made her trip. She landed awkwardly, coughing as she turned around to see what caused her to fell. It seemed a human at first, with skin as pale as winter, laying with her back supported up by the tree. Even unconscious and roughed up, her presence radiated royalty. Two horns protruded from her neck, crystalized and looking sculpted like diamonds. Her dress was a formal light blue, with snowflakes falling from it to coat the ground in a faint layer of flakes. She wasn’t a succubus, nor did she look to be someone that would rape a child.“That would be me,” Someone said to the side of old Kiris. She started to turn her head, but a hand stopped her by grabbing her by the chin. “If you don’t like how she looked, you will simply faint at the damage I took on with subduing her. In fact, you would jump at even me talking to you if you were frozen in fear would you?”The voice was right, and prying into her mind like a knife wiggling its way into a case of butter. No hands had fondled her body, and yet Kiris already felt violated, with nothing that she could do. “That’s right, with your one mistake, you’ve trapped yourself in the presence of a monster. But I’m a benevolent monster and not one who has the time to afford to play with prey in my current state. I’m willing to let you go, but you must pay a price.”“w-w-w-w-w-What price?” Kiris said, mustering up enough bravery to speak. She was no soldier, no hero. Her dress was already torn by her inability to be agile. Her livelihood was in the hands of an injured succubus, and she perceived no way out but to accept her fall into depravity. “I think you know, but think about how good it will would feel if you just accepted on your own. You have promise that you don’t see, and a heart that would be bursting with vigor if you only came out of your own shell. I can make you great….as my right hand….”____________________________________________________________________________“The right hand of Di,” Kiris finished, staring at the last panel she drew.“You have been drawing the lescatie emblem for the last five minutes,” Virto pointed out, staring at her dragging her foot around to draw it in the dirt eight times over. “Also who the heck is Di? That sounds like a name you would nickname yourself in a first-person shooter.”“You’re going to shoot me!?” Kiris said, raising her up in defense. “No no, it’s a genre of video games.”“What is a video game?”“It’s…” Virto started to explain but noticed the sun starting to go down. “It’s something I’ll have to explain some other time we meet again, but I need to go find shelter.” He got up and gathered his things before making his exit. Before making the one-way trip into this universe, he managed to take a couple of things with him. The first was the rope he had tied around himself in case he needed to get himself back out of there, but he didn’t account for the portal closing with enough force to snap apart the material. The other thing was a suitcase with essentials that he thought he would need just in case. He lost it in a scuffle with the dragon, but he managed to find it lodged firmly up in the tree. “God damnit…” He attempted to climb it up but kept slipping as he couldn’t find a good enough hold to pull himself up the tree bark.“You’re leaving me?” Kiris said, looking disappointed. “But we have to go to Di…”“I don’t know who this Di person is, but you can go there yourself.”“I don’t wanna, it’s scary in the dark.” She saw the sun reach below the horizon, getting ready to go into hiding for another 12 hours. “Besides, I really know where she is…”“Don’t mean to be harsh, but not my problem. Damn, this case is too high….” Kiris spoke again, but all that came out was a silent opening of her mouth. Silence that knew that it was beaten, and that there was no convincing him. She nodded and slowly walked away, trudging her feet as she traveled down the path away from Virto. Virto eventually got his case, but by then it was nighttime, and he fell back down the tree on his stomach. After groaning, he dusted himself and traveled in a random direction, opting for a clearing rather than dense forest. At least in a field, he can see his attacker coming in from afar.Once reaching the middle of a field, he started setting up shop, popping open his case. It was the size of a suitcase, so it was able to accommodate the tools he needed for both survival and basic circuitry. For now, he took out a lighter and started handpicking grass, clearing a bit of land out before placing the pile in the center, and lighting it for light. He then took off his lap coat and used it as a bed, laying on it as he fell asleep to the sight of fire burning in front of him.He woke up a few hours later, to an early dawn. The sun had not come up yet, but it was getting close looking at the horizon around him. However, it wasn’t an off sleep schedule he woke up to. He used the fire to do a quick scan of his surroundings, not turning his body much until he felt something pressed up behind him. He turned around to see the lesser succubi from before, all curled up on a portion of the lap coat he was sleeping on. She was staring into the fire, refusing to fall asleep. “I know, I know, you have to kick me out of your grassy place….”“What? I never said that. I just said I wasn’t going to go with you to Di,” Virto responded, the wings on Kiris’ back extending out as she looked up at the man in front of her. “So I can come with you?” He shrugged, laying back down to sleep once more. He didn’t see it, but she started smiling, thankful that she could probably be able to at least try to drag him over to wherever her master was, whoever it was…____________________________________________________________________________It was well into morning now, unlike the light-less dawn of before. Virto didn’t think to bring any cooking supplies, so they were just packing up his suitcase and going for a long walk for now. “So is a video game run on magic? A glowing box sounds like magic,” Kiris said, finding his lighter and playing with it. “No, and give me that, you could burn yourself on that.”“Burn myself? Is it fueled by the sweat of an Ignis?” She asked, watching him snatch the lighter from her before she could light a flame. “An Ignis? That sounds just as made up as a dragon. For that matter, of all the possibilities why did I find someplace that also speaks English?”“I don’t know what language English is, but here I speak the language of the Chief God.”“That would be English, or Latin depending on where we are in this world...say where are we?”“This is Orderite land,” she said, holding up two books that she has with her. “I wanted to at least try to stay with you, so I thought if I found something on the chance you can read…”“Oh, thank you.” Virto took the books and skimmed through both of them, giving one back before settling on the other. “First one seemed religious and biased, but this one has a world map, country map, and an encyclopedia of a bunch of different women. Why does this have an encyclopedia of a bunch of different women?” He said, flipping through each one. “The priests call them monster girls. They say we are supposed to avoid them, but I am one now. Wait, are you gonna avoid me!?”“No, I don’t care for whatever...god..you’re following.” He tucked the book into the case and closed it, now ready to travel. “First things first, we need to find a food source.”____________________________________________________________________________On and on they hiked down the trail, only being greeted by more and more lands that seemed to unfurl out before them like a rolled-up log. With the sun up and about, it was becoming too hot to bear for Virto, who was still wearing all of the clothing he had on since he had come to this world. Under his word they took their second break of the morning, sitting in the grass while the sun beat down on them. “Being...a succubus is so hard. Moving...too hard…”
“You have a point. I don’t think I can survive being out here without something coming up soon. Why didn’t I pack any water?” He said, wiping the sweat off his face before taking off his lab coat. They walked under it, Virto saying that the whiteness of it should reflect more light off both of them if they put the coat over their heads. Kiris didn’t understand the logic behind it, but she was all for it if it meant less heat. They trudged on like this for another hour, before something else but land and dirt. A dot had appeared, which grew larger and into more dots as they got closer. “Others!” Kiris said, darting from under the lab coat to run to the dot. “Kiris wait!” Virto said, cursing under his blanket as he hurried on his own pace.Kiris kept running, her sprint turning into a jog as she couldn’t keep up the speed. Yet she continued on, excited to see someone else other than her or Virto in these lands. Maybe they had food, or water, or something for her to f- befriend! Befriend, she can’t let herself get caught up in lewds now!Could she?Kiris slowed down to a walk when she could make out what she was seeing. It was a multitude of horses, with two pulling a covered wagon behind them. They were all knights of the order with their gold and white styles, but they stared daggers at Kiris when she came up in front of them and waved as friendly as she could. “H-hi! I was wondering if I could receive a basket of fruits for me and my friend over there....” she pointed over to the man she left behind, still a few hundred feet from her. “Do you know where you are miss?” the knight on the lead horse said, motioning to two to bring the man closer over to the group. “Of course!” She said, curtsying before them. “You are the best of the best, the escorts of the country. You bring supplies too all and take prisoners away.”“That is correct. You must be one of the converted ones.”“That wouldn’t be a problem would it?” She asked, the knights placing his hands around his waist and lifting her up. “No it wouldn’t because we’ll give you a ride alright…”She stared at the knight as he carried her to the back of the wagon, where Virto was being escorted onto the wagon. “Virto guess what! I got them to give us a ride to their outpost!” She exclaimed as she pushed herself on with him. “Hey, your lab coat is missing.”“Yes, it is. Do you know why Kiris?” he asked, seemed upset with her. “No I don't, did you leave it outside?” Virto facepalmed and waited till the knight left to pick up until they started moving again. He then took out the lighter he stashed in his pants pocket and flicked on the flame, illuminating the wagon they were in. They saw numerous faces, all of them sitting on the sides of the wagon, and looking down to the floor in some depressing way. There was only one other man there, but he was crying along with another monster girl. “Knights, monsters, some “Chief God”. Kiris, how the fuck did I manage to put two and two together before you?”He gave her a moment before the realization set it where she was. “I’m in a prisoner convoy!?”“Yes! And now my things are confiscated because they show signs of ‘demonic mana’. This must be how it felt to know things in the Middle Ages...and now, I can’t do anything but light this place on fire, but that would be idiotic, because…” he knocks on the moving floor below him. “This place is made out of fucking wood and cloth! So congratulations, I am now about to spend the rest of my life in slavery!”“S-sorry, I didn’t mean too…”“Of course you didn’t! And yet I’m still mad at you! If we only waited…” he trailed off, noticing the disapproving looks he was getting from the other prisoners for chewing Kiris out. He shut himself up and scooted to a spot next to the wall, staring at the flame in furrowed silence. Kiris started to follow but then thought it would be best if she just moved to a different place than beside him. She scooted to the opposite side, taking up the other’s look of sadness as she stared at the ground. She fell asleep like that, waking up to someone patting her back. Her eyes blinked open as she saw Virto patting her, behind him the other prisoners leaving the convoy one by one. “Come on, we’re here.”“I should just stay here and suffer. I was the reason you were caught in this mess...”“And you will be the reason I somehow get out, as soon as I figure out how to do that.” He lifted her up and helped her down to the ground, looking around at where they both were. They seemed to be at a camp, with other soldiers milling around doing training regimens. The camp was surrounded by around ten feet worth of stone, enough to discourage jumping over just enough. Once everyone was out, they have escorted a spear point to barracks, already filled with other prisoners that seemed to be here. “Any chance I would be able to sleep somewhere else?” Virto said. “There’s always the hole you pathetic swine. Now get in,” said one of the knights, poking Virto’s sides until he was all the way in the door then swinging it closed on him. Virto turned around to look around, as did all the new prisoners did as they stood wondering what to do.____________________________________________________________________________            “197, 198, 199, 200…” Virto counted to himself while looking out the window. While Kiris nervously went around asking if there was room to sleep on a bed, Virto was busy putting together an escape plan. He figured that if he was in a different time, it should be easy for him to figure out something practical to do. As he stared out the window, he saw a gal with purple hair and dressed in purple robes come up to him. “Dark Mage….you’re a Dark Mage right?” he said. He had tried to remember some of the mamono names while he skimmed through it, but it wasn’t 100%. “Yes, I am. Are you trying to figure out a plan as well?” She asked. “Yes, but I already have one see. But I need a distraction.”            “I’m not your guy, I’m saying that now,” he said, the dark mage chuckling. “No no, I’m not asking you to draw harm to yourself. You and I…we are both smart people. However, I can’t figure out what distraction would work best...I was wondering if you had any idea…”            “Hmm.” He looked around, moving to another window to get a different view. “What if you hit the lunch hall? It seems possible that that will create the most chaos.”            “The lunch hall? Wouldn’t that tall tower be better?” She said, pointing to the church tower. “We’re trying to create a distraction, not get killed. If I learned anything from religion, is that you don’t mess with it if you can.”            “Fair enough, but I’ll need your container of Ignis sweat.”            “Lighter fluid, and sure,” he said, handing over the lighter to the mage. She took it and nodded, her right pointer finger flowing as she drew an inscription into the lighter. “Our abilities aren’t restricted, only weakened severely. That was the weakness you needed to know.”“So what would my lighter do?” Virto asked, watching the mage quickly move to the front door. She aimed then threw it, watching the small object land in someone’s pocket headed for the mess hall. “Being brilliant is one thing, but now I have fuel to make up the difference.”“So what you mean is-” before Virto could finish the mess hall suddenly blew up, the explosion looking like 10 tons of TNT had just gone off on a table in the middle of it. Everyone’s head turned as the explosion rocked the ground, causing everyone in the prisoner barracks to be affected as well. “Virto what did you dooOOooOo,” Kiris exclaimed as she fell off a top bunk into a lamia’s hands.“No time to explain. Mage what do we do next!?” Virto asked. “Is it a bad time to say my name’s Isuka?”“Yes!”“Alright, just get me to the church tower! There I can disable their stupid weakening effect!” She grabbed Virto’s arm as he started running, the sheer power of the explosion leaving all eyes off the two as they quickly got into the church. There were two guards there, but they were quickly dispatched with a sleep spell. “I thought you said it weakened you,” Virto said as he stepped over the slumbering soldiers. “I also said it was stupid. Here it is,” she said, pointing to an open book that was glowing. She simply went up to it and closed the book, an aura forming around her and just as quickly disappearing into mist around her. “It’s done.”“Wait, that’s it?”“Yes, as I said, it’s a stupid thing. In about 10 minutes this camp is gonna get monsterized, so get your succubus friend and meet me by the waterfall.” She left the church after to start wreaking magical havoc, leaving Virto to just stare as dust from the ceiling fell with each major thud.____________________________________________________________________________“Aaaaaai!, I found you!” Kiris said, tackle hugging Virto to the ground as the camp was alight with purple fire behind her. “Where were you!?”“I was looking for you. Where were you?”“Uhhh….” She thought back to the last seven minutes, where the mamono were ‘helping her grow into her new body’. Her body got more developed and taller sure, but she still had some of that burning desire left in her. Right now her tail is plugging away any evidence of debauchery, but she felt embarrassed about possibly telling him. “I was…”“Nevermind then. Hey, I’m going to meet a Dark Mage. She wanted us to come to her after the camp was done being turned pro mamono.”“But weren’t we going to meet Di?”“From what I know you still have no idea about where she is, so no! We aren’t. But feel free to ask the Dark Mage for directions when we get to her.”“Alright…but I can still come with you right?” She clung onto Virto’s arm, still not willing to separate away from him. He shrugged again and started walking, with a succubus in tow as they made their way to the Dark Mage….____________________________________________________________________________“Alright, let’s do this one last time,” Virto said, extending a wooden stick before tapping the ground one last time. Etched into it, was a range of pictures crudely drawn in the dirt. “First off all, I am from a place called ‘Earth’, and I came through an amazing feat of technology that I don’t know if I can replicate, nor get myself back through.” He pointed to a circle that had the word ‘invention’ written into it. “Next on the agenda, it appears that we have a mutual lack of understanding of our cultures. So, my lighter is not made out of the sweat of a fire elemental. We all speak Englishenglish, although you may not call it that in your world. And last but not least, my lighter is not made out of sweat. Anyways, any questions? Kiris?” He pointed the stick to the lesser succubus, who quickly shook her head.“I have a question. Why not use magic instead of technology? Then you can travel between realms easily.” Isuka said, not understanding the lack of magic in his world. “I can’t, with one of the reasons being I traveled through universes instead of realms.”“I guess that makes sense. To travel through universes you will need someone more powerful...oh wait,” Isuka snapped, opening a portal to another universe. “Your chariot awaits. See? Easy magic, technology hard.”“Oh, then why is it that when I look in it…” Virto peered inside, seeing nothing but white space. “...It looks more like a sandbox?”            “You said universe, you never said parallel universe…”            “So can you make a portal to my parallel universe?”            “.....No.”            “For fuck’s sake....” Virto said, palming is face while Kiris dug through Isukas provisions. After so long, she found food that she could eat, and now she had two people to that could help her get to Di. She really wanted to bring Virto with her, and now possibly Isuka since she seems helpful to the cause. As she watched both of them argue over the limitations of using technology, she heard a voice go through her head. Kiris….Kiris….“W-what?” she muttered under her breath, looking around to who said that.Thank goodness. I feared that I still wouldn’t have enough power to afford to communicate. Where is my specimen, hmm?“I-I’m with some others…”Some others? Dear, I thought you would make a beeline for my location. Then again… I sense you are with a mage. I didn’t give you anything to guide you to your lord, didn’t I? Fine then. But please do hurry, my other subjects are just dying to meet their new toy… “Toy?” She said, getting worried. “I thought I would be your right hand….”You do not understand, do you? Words are subjective Kiris. They can be molded and bent like clay, and shaped to fit one’s definition or desire. Whatever you thought I meant, I said what I meant, and you accepted it. Unless...you don’t wish to disobey your Master, do you?“No!” She yelled out. Isuka and Virto suddenly looked at Kiris, who nervously giggled and dropped her apple. “No, there might be a worm that could eat my fruit….”“She’s a strange one….anyways we make a beeline for my library tomorrow. You are welcome to stay there as long as you wish,” Isuka said, shaking hands with Virto. “Thanks, but I still think technology is better.”“Ahaha, you keep thinking that human. Now then, it’s time to get some shuteye,” Isuka patted Virto’s shoulder and snapped her fingers, three futons appearing out of thin air. Isuka took the left one, while Virto took the middle. “Fell free to keep watch, but my spells should be enough to protect us Kiris.”“A-alright…,” Kiris said as the two of them fell asleep in a matter of moments. It has been a long day, and the sun was just beginning to fall down. On the three. “That was close,” Kiris said, finishing her apple after wiping off the dirt.Yes, it was. Now, please be more urgent the next day. Tomorrow, you will ask the mage to bring you to me, and then at long last, we can begin our wonderful time together…
  
    Chapter Text
    “So what are you thinking?” Isuka said, drinking a potion that she made for herself. It didn’t have any magical properties, she just calls many things potions as a general term. Actual potions and other miscellaneous mixtures, including….            “For one, I think that you shouldn’t be drinking soda so much,” Virto pointed out. “How does your toothpaste keep up?”            “Toothpaste? I don’t wait my three minutes on that task no more.” She tapped her front teeth, the teeth seeming to clean themselves in a wave that spread out until each teeth was naturally clean of any food. “Spells have their uses, you can not deny.”            “Sure maybe, but I still prefer technology over magic. There’s just a sense of achievement that you can’t get with wiggling your fingers and saying abra-cadabra. Speaking of which, and getting back on topic, I fear that I won’t be able to get back to my world.”            “You’re giving up just like that?” Isuka said, seeming surprised. “No, I currently don’t have the power nor stature to get myself back to my world, and if there’s some hope, no one would have noticed my presence being missing. But my idea is some sort of portable device...one powerful enough to counter most magic effects.”            “Like a spellbook?"            “No….actually, maybe.” Virto looked at his wrist, looking at the fitness watch he wore. He remembered how he would go for runs so he is at least fit while doing science, thinking about how the watch stored data. Maybe if it could store more than what companies try now….            “I’m thinking more of a watch. You see, we don’t need handwritten text to store spells, or anything else. We have this. “He held up his fitness watch, showing the screen to Isuka.” What is it, a compression spell?” She asked, tapping the black screen. She gasped when it came on, displaying the time for her to see. “Impressive, but why is it 7 hours behind?”            “We must be in UTC, shit...anyways this watch uses programming to store bits of data, which can be converted into ACSII, or writing in layman’s terms. But if I make some adjustments to it, I can increase the power that this can hold.”                      “What if you also throw in a bit of wizardry?” Isuka asked. “No, I made my stance on technology, and I must keep myself there. It would be like admitting I couldn’t do anything without you.”            “I guess I can respect that...but what will she do while you’re busy working away?” Isuka gestured to Kiris, who was cooking a 3-person meal while talking as if she had Bluetooth earphones in her ears. “Yes, I’ll ask them now...I...I just need to butter her up with some pancake batter…”            “She has been talking to herself for a while. Is she sane?” Isuka asked. “Except for being a succubus, I think so. A little ptsd wouldn’t hurt her. Now, I will ask one thing.”            “What do you wish?”            “I need you to spell up some material. While I am tech-savvy, I can’t exactly start mining and making tools from ore…”____________________________________________________________________________Why have you not arrived yet? The Di asked her future slave. Kiris searched around for an answer as she cut the pancake into smaller parts, making use of Isuka’s spells to create a large iron for her to heat the batter on. However Kiris made it a bit too big, so she was able to create a giant pancake that was the size of a dining room table. Haven’t you seduced the Dark Mage yet?“It’s really hard! What if I…” Kiris went to the back of the large library, where Isuka was watching Virto dismantle the watch. “What if they kick me out?”Hmm….would you like me to, give you a bit of confidence in your ability?~ Kiris could hear the voice in her head leak of lewd intent, but she didn’t feel in a position to refuse a positive-sounding offer. You’re thinking yes aren’t you my specimen? Fine then, please give me a moment. It takes time to transfer consciousness over the expanse of the universe…“Universe? D-di what do you m-” She didn’t get to finish her sentence as the color in her pupils suddenly left her eyes. She fell on the floor, dropping the knife beside her as her body landed with a thud.“Show yourself fiend!” Isuka yelled as she rushed over to the sound of the thud, her hands glowing with purple energy as she looked around for a signature. The only one she could find was Kiris, who was laying on the ground unconscious. “Kiris, did someone hurt you?” Isuka asked, picking Kiris up and sitting her on a chair. She tapped her cheek, watching her red eyes open up to gaze at Isuka. “Yes, I am very well,” ‘Kiris’ said, getting up and stretching her legs. “I’m still a lesser succubus?”“Yes, you haven’t really absorbed the spirit energy from yesterday yet. So what happened? I heard a noise.”“Oh, that? It is nothing, I….” Kiris looked to the side of her, seeing the pancake in the midst of being divided into smaller circles. “I slipped on some batter that I didn’t notice before. You know me, shy and clumsy as ever….” She put on a convincing smile, swaying her body while Isuka nodded. “Well, I’ll leave you to it. Be careful with that knife, if you slip again you might not be as lucky with where it lands.”“I’ll keep it in mind~” Kiris waved as Isuka turned around a went away, licking her lips as she stared at Isuka’s ass before the mage turned the corner out of sight. “I’ll definitely keep it in mind…now then, what is this about you not being able to take in spirit energy?” Kiris felt around until she reached under her torn dress, moving her hand around until latching on to something metal. “Aha, what a cheap trick those orderites do. Sorry Kiris, you will have to bleed for a bit....urrr!” With a grunt, she pulled a metal ring out from between her thighs, watching it weakly glow gold until it faded and crumbled to dust. “Scarring children by putting such a crude limiter into their body...poor soul must have felt backed up in her heart for months. Now then, back to cutting these pancakes before they realize….”____________________________________________________________________________“These pancakes are very well made Kiris,” Isuka said while making another piece fly into her mouth. “Yes, it’s a shame Virto isn’t here to try them along with us,” Kiris said, looking in his general direction. Behind the rows of bookshelves that block her view, there is a Virto doing work on his watch. To the side of the watch frame he held while adjusting it, laid the machinery that he took out. To the other side of the frame, new parts and materials he planned to incorporate into her re-invention of his watch. “It would be lovely if he was here with us….”“Yes it would...say, you’ve gotten a lot more eloquent ever since you finally started changing into a proper succubus,” Isuka noted the more purplish skin, the larger, more disproportional breasts size. “You can say it’s a side effect of leaving my ignorant roots. Do you like the pancakes?” Kiris asked her. “Yes, it’s...very good. Say, what is your homemade recipe? I wish the share this with my book group later.”“You have a book group?” Kiris asked her. “Of course, remember when I showed you yesterday? Come on you have to remember someone,” Isuka said, a cup of cocoa floating up to her mouth for her to sip. “Of course I do, but can you remind me?”“....Maybe later.” Isuka got up all of a sudden, clearing her throat. “I need to keep my distance...so I don’t become influenced by your sudden change I mean.”“Of course,” Kiris said. “Demonic Energy can radiate off anyone…”“Yes…” Isuka left the table without another word, going back to where Virto was working with a plate of pancakes for him so he doesn’t forget to eat. “Why can’t she be oblivious, like those funny people in the horror theater…no matter. Once I fully perfect Kiris’ form I’ll enough power to bring both of them to my castle. Ahh, being able to watch my minions convert all three of them would be wonderful…”____________________________________________________________________________“Do you get an off feeling about Kiris?” Isuka asked, handing Virto a screwdriver. “No, not really. Then again, I haven’t slept in 20 hours.”“You’ve also not left this room in 20 hours. You have no idea what I’m talking about. I would be impressed if only not left to wonder how you’re holding your bladder.”“Years of practice and not wanting to use the campus bathrooms does that to you. Look, I’m sure whatever is going with Kiris she’s fine,” Virto said, tightening the last screw on his new modified watch. “There, done compressing an incomprehensible amount of engineering and coding into this small thing not larger than a very large coin.”“Yes, now will you come to see what I’m talking about?” Isuka said, waiting at the door. “Sure, I guess I can put on a watch while I come look at this strange Kiris. What if she’s just going through monsterization?” Virto got up from his seat, putting the watch pokey thing through one of the holes as he followed Isuka’s footsteps. “Monsterization doesn’t cause this much of a personality change this quickly. I fear it may be something more that we’re not seeing…”They walked quickly, arriving back at where Isuka and Kiris ate previously. The leftover pancakes and pieces that were cut out were packed away neatly onto plates. Everything used was cleaned up and dried off, set on the edge of the table. The cooking materials received the same treatment, the area was wiped clean of any spillage, and the chairs were pushed in. The only thing missing was an awkward succubus in the middle of a transformation.“Kiris? Where are you? Isuka says that you are acting awkward,” Virto said out loud, his voice having a slight echo before the library quickly fell into silence once more. All of a sudden, all of the lights of the library went out, only for a single floodlight to shine up to the rafters. There sat a demon, her purple skin and yellow eyes basking in bright light. “Well, he isn’t wrong,” the demon said, licking her lips while she looked down to the man that came up to right under her below.“Isuka, that isn’t Kiris. That’s just a demon that got in your library. Hey, demon! Can you get out? The library’s closed.”“On the contrary,” the demon said. “For I am Kiris A., former orderite villager, and now a beautiful spitting image of Master Di. Now, shall we go?”“Even if you are Kiris I’m still not going to whoever that Di person you keep talking about. This is your last warning before you get forced out.”“Fine then. Just yesterday I pinned you to the ground so you can be fucked, then later I managed to get us both captured by some prisoner escorts. I am the reason you know more about mamono, as I gave you a book created mainly by the Wandering Scholar.”“Oh, yeah then that’s pretty personal and accurate. Fine, but I’m still going to shoot you if you don’t stop being threatening.” Virto aimed his left arm at Kiris while holding his right arm over the watch to press it.“When I wished for an oblivious foil, I didn’t expect it to happen so easily. He really does not know?” Kiris asked Isuka. “He’s sleep-deprived,” Isuka responded“As all humans are to a certain. On that note, what if you surpass your mortality, through my guiding ha-”“Nope.” Virto pressed his watch, a small needle shooting out up to Kiris at a rapid speed. The demon only laughed and tilted her head, the needle sailing by to hit somewhere else harmlessly. “Tsk tsk, you didn’t let me finish my offer. Well, we can make it another time, maybe in person when you’re more willing...until then, Holi!”The roof shattered, covering both Virto and Isuka in a shower of dust. It blinded them temporarily, enough that something hit them both in the back and knocked them to the ground. The dust that had risen had suddenly be fanned away, and it soon became clear why. As Isuka looked up at her assailant, she saw a strange-looking gun pointing at her forehead. The bearer had a black war helmet and a visor that completely covered her face and head. Her armor looked made for her body, with grey metallic portions that had been rounded out to leave whatever human or mamono was under there comfortable.“God fuck,” Virto said, coughing the dust out while getting some out of his eyes. He managed to get most of it out of his right eye, only to open it to a pistol cocking over his head. “...hey why does your roof buster look like the female version of Master Chief?”“I have no idea who you are referring to, but this is one of my treasured members of my group. I will leave the subduing to her while I take this body back to my own home. Ta ta~” Kiris winked and leaped from her spot down to the ground, strutting out through the front doors away from Virto and Isuka. Isuka attempted a spell before the doors swung back closed, but Holi stepped on her foot, keeping it down so she couldn’t make any use of her power. She stood still like that for several minutes, with two fully loaded guns held to both their skulls until she didn’t. She put the blaster back on her back and pistol in her holster on her side and stepped back from the two on the floor.“She got away Isuka,” Virto said, getting up and brushing off his clothing. “But um...the Holi gal isn’t leaving.”“It’s nothing new. When one takes over new territory, she leaves a second in command behind to ensure the Chief God doesn’t encourage any uprising once the mamono leader leaves. My guess is that she’s going to keep us on house arrest.” Isuka tried moving to the door, but Hoil quickly got in front of her, standing in the way. “But that doesn’t matter right now. Where’s the real Kiris being kept?”____________________________________________________________________________Kiris opened her eyes, stirring with a headache pounding against her head. She looked around, seeing only the dim light of the moon that entered her room.As the cloud moved out of the way of the moon, the room got bright enough to see in. She saw herself in a bedroom, a large one that looked fit for a queen. “W-what happened to me…”She tried thinking about the memories of before she went under. It made the headache worse but started working as she pieced together what she had. She was making pancakes, and Isuka and Virto were in another room busy….wait where were there?“Isuka? Isuka!?” She yelled at progressively louder volumes, the only thing answering is the light sound of her mattress when she moves around. They won’t answer child, you are far, far away from them.“What did you do with them!?” Kiris yelled back. They are fine, and so are you. All I’ve done was simply brought you to where you belong. Think of it as spending time away from your schoolmates to do something you’re passionate about. What are you passionate about Kiris?“W-well...I like cooking.”Yes, but sometimes you must learn cooking on your own to truly grow as a chef. Yes…“This doesn’t make sense Di…” Kiris said, rubbing her temples as she waited for her headache to pass.Di is too informal if you are going to come under my wing. Call me master for now…“Yes, master?”Good, now everything will make sense in due time. For now, however, get your sleep, let your body rest...you’ll need it for tomorrow.
  
    Chapter Text
    “Can I leave now?” Virto asked for the ump-teenth time, getting another head shake from Holi once more. “If you need anything in the outside world, I shall provide it as master Di said.”“I need to go into the outside world.”“Null error. Resorting to response LC11.”“We are in a world that runs on sex and magic and somehow you, a magical robot, is still using assembly?” Virto asked, confused on how that’s possible.“You may have done your research in your short time here, but there are still many things you do not understand. Now beat it before I either shoot you or fuck you against a wall.” Holi put her hand on her pistol at her waist. “Maybe I’ll do both~”“So you’re a robot through and through?”“Yes, and no. Many believe I’m just a soldier. At least the many that remember….and awaken in time.”“What does that mean?” Virto asked. “Actually nevermind, I guess can you help me modify this watch on my wrist…”“I don’t see why not. It can coincide with my 2nd task to seduce you and Isuka.”“You said that just point blank without no concern that we could fight against it….cool. Well, I work in the backroom….” the two of them left the door and headed in the direction of the back of the library, while Virto talked about the additional features he had in mind for adding. As they passed a table, Holi suddenly stopped and looked at the chairs that were tucked in under it. “Go on ahead, I need to sit down,” she said, Virto shrugging and continuing his walk to the room. She lifted the table and turned over one of the chairs, seeing a miniature Isuka talking over a proportionally small portal. “I need to go,” Isuka said, closing the portal.“I hope that wasn’t anything I need to take care of,” Holi said, placing the chair down as Isuka grew back to normal size under the chair. “I hope you know I will figure out who you called. So shall we make this easy, hard, or lewd?”____________________________________________________________________________Far, far away in the lands of Zipangu - basically a thousand miles away - there was a small farmhouse that seemed abandoned. Dust was everywhere, small non-mamono critters and crawlers went around, and the light shone into the broken windows that weren’t repaired. It was a decaying old thing, and one would think that no one lived in there...but someone did.The windows weren’t in working order, but they lack the same kind of dust that the rest of the house had. There are definitely critters around, but nothing has infested the place. Someone was living here, yet not repairing the house to its former glory.And in the room where the kitchen was, we had our answer. Since it was a done house, much of the things in the kitchen were taken out, leaving an empty room with nothing in it as much as the other rooms, but one person was there, stirring bubbling fluids in a cauldron in the center of the room. He had short, tiny stubby horns on his head, and white hair with a clump of it that was black. His skin was albino, and his eyes were red like the blood that flowed through him. He wore a grey and gold hooded garment and pants that looked made for someone larger than his size. Finally, his ears were shaped like a holstaur’s, going down and out, and wiggling every time they tracked noise. He recited mantras under his breath as he stirred, taking the stirring spoon out of the cauldron every once in a while to test its taste.It was really only his soup that he made from what he gathered earlier. The only spellcasting going on his is sayings that he uses to keep the cauldron hot, so everything can boil and liquidize. While he was cooking his dinner, a portal opened up beside him. “Natsumi,” Isuka whispered as he stirred. “Oh, my savior. Am I still in danger?”“No, but I need to hurry. I am going to ingrain something in your mind at some point. My task for you, is not to question it, and follow the instructions to a tee.”“Yes, I owe you anything you wish for. You freed me from a life of servitude, so it is the least I can do to return your kindness.” Isuka nodded and looked around, hearing other people. “I must go for now, if someone comes looking for you do not befriend!” She said quickly, closing the connection right after uttering the last word. Just like that, he was left alone to his own devices once more, listening only to the bubbling sound of his cauldron.Hey spent the next day inside his home, watching a spider move around while he waited for the Dark Mage to send him the image for him to look at in his thoughts. He hadn’t heard from the mage for a day now, but he was reassured that whatever happens, he will get his task. What else does he have in his life to tend to if he doesn’t right?Family? No, he lost them as a child...an entire thing that many of his peers have gone through. Kidnapped, raped, experimented on, the usual horrors an unlucky child carries with them into adult life. But he was a lucky one. He was in the right place, at the right time to be found by Isuka.As he remembers it, he was doing his tasks of cleaning someone’s produce while he saw a woman that stood out against the bland collars of the crowd. She adjusted her glasses as if they were an outlet to keep her fidgety hands from showing fear. She clutched a large text under her left arm, one that looked worn for wear and cobbled together. But what attracted that small suffering demon boy was that large opening in her clothing right at her chest...if you looked, it was impossible to feel shame for your head being pulled down with lust, because her mounds were so out there that it stays in your partial view even if your eyes are directed to hers.As for any man, and some women, he found himself staring at the women. Lust was building up as he paused his job, panting as his corrupted body longed for a piece of that female in his hands. It collided with his hopelessness on getting out of his horrible situation as well. Why let this opportunity pass when your master might not even let you be free? His brain argued. He refuted that argument the first time he thought of it, telling himself that he didn’t wish to be punished by his master. It was not worth the sure torture he will endure for just a quick session of sex…The second time was a bit harder, as he thought about all the times his master had punished him already. Bondage, paddles, and even the occasional bout of public shaming. He had endured these for so long, so what’s another one to his resume, hmm? Why should you care when the threat has been done long enough to devalue its scariness in your head?By the third time, he had made up his mind. In reality, this took only a mere moment, but that moment was enough for him to watch her pass almost out of reach. It was a gamble, but a gamble he was willing to get. He threw down the broom and darted at the mage, his horniness taking over as he slowed down to weave in between the crowd he was walking in. He knew he didn’t have much time before he was captured, so he needed to make this count. He got closer with each step, time seeming to slow around him in the heat of the moment. He reached his hand to his back, trying to grab her before it’s too late. His vision, or at least the one in his memory, was going white, her image fading out as his remembrance was reaching his limit. If only for a piece of her voluptuous skin before going back to being a depressed pawn…He doesn’t remember much about that day other than her. The Mage said she eventually took him to a far-off area after seeing him trudge back to the store where he belonged forever. Guilt trip of course, which turned into a task of getting his lust down before he frotted himself into an orgasm. He was really a mess that day, but was he better off and less of a mess under his Master?After waiting for a while he got the task from the Mage, it was like a flash of a camera taking your picture, burning an image into his head, and leaving his eyesight just like that. He will never get used to that flash, as it comes without warning and too suddenly to be able to expect it. He thought the image over, seeing what he needed to accomplish. They were ordered in steps, to be followed to a tee.Natsumi furrowed his brow, then got to work following the first few instructions. He was instructed first off to pack his things, as staying in one location would be an easier way of getting captured. He went to a corner and reached behind a web, getting supplies for him to perform spells. Talismans, a quill, and some squid ink for doing simple things, like shrinking or enlarging. His own book of spells that he can use when in a pinch of not knowing spells. An onahole because well…you know. His cauldron and stirring were shrunk so he is able to eat. Finally, he took a red disk that he had stored in a different portion of the broken home. He was told to only use it when stuck in a situation that was dire enough to require a miracle. With that, he was ready to embark on his journey to fulfill his task. He had the resolve of a soldier in him and was willing to perish if it meant he will be done.____________________________________________________________________________“1…2…3!” Kiris said, trying one more time to ram her way through the door of her large bedroom. Her new purplish demon form gave her strength, but it was like being given the answer for 10 questions to a 50 question math test. Even with her newfound might, that damn door will not budge in even the slightest. She crumpled to the floor, the table she was holding falling with her. She groaned as the legs of the table snapped in the mess of a pile, sore from all the all the times she had tried to break out. “Someone...save me…” she said, resigned to her fate in this room.As she laid there losing hope, a click was heard above her. She looked up as she watched the doorknob turn to open the door. The door managed to open only a bit before being stopped by the combination of a busty demon and a broken table. “Nya?” Went the voice as she pushed a bit harder on to the door. “Who’s in front of me?”“Are you h-hear to save me?” Said Kiris, moving herself out of the way and dragging the broken table with her. The door swung open as the person kneed the door open, showing herself to Kiris in the daylight coming in through the windows. She wore a maid dress, with a skirt that barely came down her thighs. Under her maid bonnet were two pink-ish cat ears, and between her legs, Kiris could see a matching pink cat tail moving behind her. She wore gloves on her hands, holding onto a tray that held breakfast. “But you’re already saved,” She said, going into the room and placing the tray on her bedside table. “No I’m not, I was captured and brought here…”“To be saved by Master Di nya” She seemed to have a thing for attaching the nya onto the end of some sentences. “She must really like you, just look at this room…”“This room is too dark…” Kiris responding, wondering if the nya was a byproduct of the maid being a catgirl. She watched her hop up to the windows, pulling the curtains that were limiting much of the light that could now come in in the morning sun. Kiris could fully view the place she was holed up in for the very first time. She knew the bed was fancy, but she never got a good look at how much it looked like something fit for a queen. The design of the roof and walls felt like watching Michelangelo paint while suspended in the air, She saw religious figures looking brought to life in pastel and stained glass. There were a multitude of material items, including an open shower in view of the entire room (excluding the powder room) and a walk-in closet for anything she wished to wear. “Do you luv the room?” The catgirl said, patting a spot in front of the bedside table. Kiris went over and sat down, crossing her legs together while looking at the decor around. “I s-still want to leave…”“So you do luv it, don’t you?” The catgirl asked, sitting beside Kiris - close enough to feel the heat radiating off her body. “Y-yes but…”“Nya nya, you’ll love staying here…” The catgirl scooted even closer, their thighs and sides touching and pressing against each other. “Master Di asked me to help you love it nya~”“What are you doi-eeeiii!” Kiris shrieked as the catgirl grabbed her chest, fondling her chest while pressing her own on her back. “My breasts w-were never this sensitive…”“That means you like it. Master gave you a better form…” She whispered in here ear, before proceeding to softly bite on it. She reveled in Kiris’s soft whimpers as she nibbled and licked her hearing organ. She pulled both of them to fall on the bed, spooning her from behind as she continued to pleasure her in soft intimacy…____________________________________________________________________________“So tell me about this Master Di,” Virto said, watching as Holi tended to his wrist with her fingers. Her pointer finger would occasionally turn into a screwhead, so she could undo the screws that held the watch closed. “I heard Kiris talk about her for a while, but I never really got to know who she is, or if she is a dictator, or…”“She is no dictator,” Holi said, lifting the screen off the watch to expose the mechanisms underneath. Everything the watch normally had was compressed down to take less space, which allowed for a small propulsion system that used a very, very, very pressed down spring and a small rack of tiny needles. There was a ring right before the hole that the needles came out, with a layer of a translucent green liquid holding on to it like it was soap on a bubble wand. “I thought you wished to harm, not tickle someone,” Holi said, shooting one needle into the table where they worked. “You thought something this rudimentary could keep you from being raped?”“I only worked with what I had, alright? It’s not like I have enough, or any power to really bring this watch’s capabilities out.” As he said that, Holi tapped herself and opened something on her arm, showing a white glowing stick. “I have many more if needed.”“Well, I’ll need some British-American sci-fi technology to make everything I want to put anything in here fit.”“I do not know what British-American means, but some of my additional parts come from Magitech.”“Close enough, I guess. now just one last thing, but what....” he looked at his watch, deciding if he wanted to add anything else. He stared for a bit, before looking back at Holi. “Hey, do you know what a server is?”____________________________________________________________________________Natsumi started setting up shop, for now, finding a nice place in the forest before placing his bag down. He took out a talisman and wrote on it, then attached it to another talisman to only write on the other one. After finishing up the second talisman, he placed it down on the ground then backed up from it. It exploded in a plume of smoke that quickly cleared, showing a lean-to made for him to sleep under. Inside it were the two talismans used, the ink from them gone as if they were never written on them at all.Now that he had a roof that would cover him, he could continue on his task. His first step was nearby, in a village he saw while traveling. He took only a few talismans and his quill, coated in a fresh coat of squid ink for the road. With that, he placed an extra talisman on his lean-to, watching as his shelter disappeared from mortal view.He put his hood over his head and started walking, horses, and carriages passing him as he closed the distance to the village. According to the image the Mage gave him, there should be a queen of this village. A Dark elven queen, known to go about her day in the kingdom instead of being inside her castle all the time. According to the instructions, this should be easy to deliver the message.Natsumi got to the gates, where he was stopped for a moment by a dark elven guard. After being checked for anything that could potentially signal an attack or coup, he was let through. Infiltration, easy enough he thought. Now to find the queen.There was no point in rushing, as that would only draw attention. Besides, this is an easy step. Easy peazy, demon squeezy. My cock. Why did I write that?He passed various dark elven going about their day. He always thought that the villagers would completely lewd, with things being done in the open that most wouldn’t even do outside of their own homes. However, there was much less lewdness out on the walkways than he thought there would be. Where he got the knowledge might have skewed him just a bit. Sure, he saw the occasional group gang up on another elf, but that was the same thing as a group going to beat up on another person for something that had happened in the past. He found who he was looking for, seeing her buying a new whip at a store. He went up to her and tapped her shoulder, watching her turn around as she looked down at the person half a foot shorter than him. “Who are you?” She asked, bending her knees and back to get a closer look at him, showing him a view of her breasts held still by her purple bra. Her whole upper ensemble looked to showcase her boobs, started with the open-front purple clothing, with tears on her arm that seemed to show lighter purple fabric underneath the dark purple. Her eyes were golden in color with matching pupils, making it seem as if she didn’t have any. Her ears, like all elves, were long and pointy. Her hair was long, much of it sitting on her back or drooping around her as she bent over. “You look like a real submissive type. Did you recently get a wife?”“I came with a message from a Dark Mage,” he responded, her smile fading. “Isuka is in trouble? What is going on small incubus? Did she fall into a deep hole, got stuck holding hands with someone…is it the holding hands?” He shook his head, whispering in her ear verbatim what he was supposed to say from the image. Her face went into surprise, then disbelief, and finally a sigh once he had reached the end of his verbal message. She turned to the storeowner and placed down the whip. “Sorry Charles, I’ll have to try your cool massage another day.”“It is alright Queen Dar Cora. I can always test run it with my friends instead.”“I told you, people, don’t call me a Queen.” She chuckled and playfully punched his shoulder before grabbing Natsumi and taking him with her. She waved to everyone she passed, but as the walk went on the looks of greetings turned silent concern. Natsumi could felt it too, the aura that was coming off her. Her face was friendly, but her demeanor was turning Stoic. Imposing. She led both of them inside the castle, up to her very room. She nodded to two dark elf guards that guarded it and went inside, Natsumi seeing a darkly lit room. The most illuminated portion was her desk, where she made a beeline too to sit down and start working on something. “Where are we going?” Natsumi asked. “We are not going anywhere. I felt it when I grabbed your hand...she sent you more tasks to accomplish. She’s gathering something big, no?” He nodded, causing her to sigh again.“I hadn’t seen Isuka in years...but I guess Queen Heathen must go on the battlefield once more.”
  
    Chapter Text
    Headen recalls back when she wasn't a Queen, but an elf that just happened to bear the Dar Cora name. Headen Dar Cora did what all dark elves did, dominate, belittle, and yet somehow stay with one partner their entire life. She just happened to do it better and at the right time. The strings of time and fate collided and created gave her power, allowing her to go off and found her own group of Dark Elves. First 20, then 50, then 100 strong, the Dar Cora clan raided the neighboring one they succeeded from, usurping the ruling family and taking over. History dictated that these sorts of events produced rulers that ruled in a way to protect their crown and keep enemies at arm's length. But the experience taught her to give people what they want. The Dar Coras ruled like an oligarchy that listened and allowed outsiders to better their reign, be it negative or positive example.Of course, taking over an established kingdom doesn't come with its fair share of consequences. It took a generation of mingling and marriage to created a rift between the Dar Coras - the Betires and the Asseto. The Dar Cora Betire are described as ones with pure Dar Cora blood rushing through their veins or descendants of the invaders in the coup. The Dar Cora Asseto consists of mixed blood, between everyone else and the Dar Coras. Headen had seen her fair share of stupidity when capturing Orderites and didn't want any of it. The Knights allow their differences in rank, age, and experience to distract them from the objective, and ultimately cause a rift that leaves them susceptible to a takeover. The first time she caught wind of the two subclans forming she found Betires the hold positions high up in her kingdom and put out an announcement heard very clearly by all who inhabit her territory - Hostility towards pure and mixed blood is grounds for immediate banishment.She has a certain Dark Mage to thank for letting her know about that weakness. The day she realized it was when she encountered that Mage. Once again, the strings of fate had brought her a gift, and her hindsight makes her glad about it. After she and the mage successfully brought the orderite territory down from the inside, their group did what all "spectators" did - sit on a hillside while watching the fruits of their labor, seeing a demon realm growing as mamono flocked like a positive reaction growing out of control. She gave her word, that far off time. Her word to repay the favorite to the Mage, no matter how big, nor how small.If only Isuka would have spent that favor on something bigger, something that would at least keep her out of the boring routine of kingdom management for up to a month...oh well, don't start looking gift horses in the mouth now.If her memory served her right, Isuka lived in a library. She never did get that. According to the Mage herself, she already did know practically everything needed. So why learn more?Oh yeah, also the robot situation. Headen shouldn't forget about that before she mucks it up for the both of them. She resolved herself and pattered her side. Her waist dawned a belt that held a few potions at her side. Some were drinkable, and some were made for her to through and to have an effect on shattering. She also had a very special summoning spell that she could use to upset the odds even more...She snuck around the perimeter, grumbling about how she feels too old to be sneaking around like a teenager trying to get into her bedroom without her parents finding out. She peered into the windows, seeing where the target was before trying to make a move. After several windows, she reached one that peered into a private room. She saw two people working inside. One was Virto, who she was warned not to engage. The other was her target, an armored automaton with jet black hair. Her left arm was open, as one of her glowing power rods was being siphoned into Virto's watch for power. She noted where she was and started sneaking around to the entrance doors. She unclasped one of her potions from her side and held it, kicking the door down and immediately scanning the place. Holi wasn't near the entrance, but Isuka wasn't in plain sight as well."I didn't expect someone to actually come," said a voice from the roof. Headen looked up, seeing Holi hovering in the air from rocket boosters on her soles. "I assume you saw my double in the backrooms?""Isuka never told me you made a double.""It's amazing what you can do in eight hours. Virto is working with a mere robot that I had in case I needed something to fill in for my presence." Holi held up her pistol, pointing it at Headen's head. "I hadn't had a free kill in years…"Holi then saw a purple laser pointed at her shoulder, moved up to her head. She looked at where it came from, seeing Isuka materializing a gun-like shape in her hand with mana. "I believe Virto calls it being tricked, backstabbed, and quite possibly bamboozled."Isuka then noticed a red dot, being aimed at her knee. Like Holi she followed the Lazer, seeing another Holi sitting at the table aiming her rifle at Isuka. "You made a third one?" She asked the one floating, Holi shaking her head. "That one is the one Virto had been working with. Look a bit closer." Isuka complied, seeing a scientist aiming at the clone Holi's head. "Then why are you so smug?" She then asked, Holi motioning to a second-story handrail. Isuka turned, seeing a 3rd Holi aiming her rifle at Virto. "That, pathetic mage, would be the 3rd clone. Now either surrender or say your last words.""I would like to say the last word, followed by 5 more seconds of nothing," Heathen said, raising her free hand and waving. "So you have chosen death. Very well, what is your last w-ISH!" The real, floating Holi was suddenly landed on by a shadow, moving too quick to for anyone in the library to see clearly. Holi went down like a burning aircraft, crashing into a corner of the library.The moment her exterior touched the ground, all hell broke loose. Virto set his in-progress watch to self destruct, then clasped it on the clone Holi's wrist. He dove for color as the clone blew up in a small explosion, sending debris and objects bouncing away. Meanwhile, the 3rd Holi was busy keeping Isuka and Heathen at bay, using her vantage point to force both of them behind objects. Headen held up a vase to see the person aiming at her, only for the vase to be shot into pieces in her very hands. "Once I deal with you, I'm gonna get that shadow that told down the real Hoooo….""Or, you can power my watch a bit more," Virto said, quickly rerouting her power to his watch to slow her down. Now unable to react faster than a toddler, Virto was easily able to tackle her to the ground, yeeting Holi's rifle away from her down into the first floor of the library.With the clones in check, Headen and Isuka moved over to the original. "So who did you call that broke through the roof?" Isuka asked. She got her answer in just a few more steps as they got to see who was. She saw a large, lion-sized dragon, his maw being held at bay Holi's hands. His scales were a dark shade of gray. Small but sharp ridges ran down his hide, counting and ending on the very end of his tail. His claws seemed retracted to a degree, but his for feet had Holi pinned under his weight. "You called a dragon!?" Isuka said astonished"You seem surprised," Heathen said as she scratched under the dragon's chin. "After we went our separate ways, we did our own things right? You took a boy under your wing, and I have a mutual deal with a dragon.""He's actually 19...but you made a deal with a dragon?""He doesn't turn into his human form mostly." She nuzzled the side of the dragon, coaxing him off Holi as Isuka bound her with some rope. She struggled, but with her body under the paw of a dragon, she didn't have wiggle room to get out. "You fools, it took a human, two mamono, and a dragon to subdue me. You can't win against Di.""And yet we will still try. Now shut up." Heathen delivered a hard kick to Holi's stomach, causing her to grimace. "So, now we need to go get Kiris right Isuka?""Not just that. I want to take the fight to her." She poofed up a roll of tape, placing some over Holi's mouth. Holi's eyes widened in confusion and surprise as listening to Isuka. "You wouldn't understand, but she snuck into my own home without me realizing before it was too late. That smug grin she had before she left unharmed…""You can't win against her on her own, you know that…" Heathen tried putting her hand on Isuka's shoulder, but Isuka shrugged it off. "That's why Natsumi must succeed. The rest of his travels are key getting what I need to defeat her…"------------------------------------------------------------------Kiris sat in her room, at the ceiling doing nothing. Her bed still smelled like sex with that neko from before. After that she left Kiris rest and exited out of the room, locking the door back once it clicked shut. Kiris had spent the last hour or two exploring her room. The closet was fully prepared for her, with dresses that looked exactly like her clothing before she was monsterized. It felt eerie to her, that her master would go through so much trouble for a "plaything". After changing and freshening herself up, she tried checking the windows to see if they were unlockable. As she expected they weren't, but there were a few panels that were unstained and perfectly clear to look through.She looked and down through them, expected to be trapped high up on a mountain, like a dragon hoarding her princess along with her mountain of gold. However, she saw no surroundings. No empty hills, no moat of lava, not even mist that conceals her location. All she saw were stars, tiny orbs of light that went as far as the eye could see. Stars surrounded her everything, with even a ground that the structure sat on. Kiris could not believe her eyes, blinking and rubbing them incase some mystical object was clouding her vision. Once she blinked she saw herself in a room several stories high, with rolling hills as if the structure was built onto of nothing. She questioned her vision, wondering which version she saw was real…Do not think about it. It will hurt your head."Di! I mean Master!" Kiris yelled out, sitting back on her bed and looking around. "You left me with a cat girl!"Catgirl? Oh, you must have met my lovely dear Yuki. Did she welcome you well?~"Her name is Yuki?" Kiris felt her hand drift down to her nethers, remember Yuki's touch as the girl rolled her clit between her two gloved fingers. She jumped out of her recollection, lifting her hand away from between her legs. Two of her fingers were already moist with her arousal.It seems she did. You loved it didn't you?~"N-no I didn't…" Kiris responded, her purple cheeks turning lighter with faster-flowing blood. You are no longer an orderite, you don't have to deny it. But mere words won't prove that to you, will it? Kiris's hand started moving back between her legs, but she herself couldn't stop it's progress. She whimpered as it grazed her opening, rubbing her folds through her panties. "I-I just took a shower…"I think the second thing I'll change about you is your mind. It is a shame really, I was excited to play with your shy personality, but it appears to carry more hindrance than positives…simply put, you must accept your new form, or be stuck in endless bliss~"I...I can't….mmmph~" Kiris covered her mouth with a hand she was able to control, rolling and squirming around on her mattress while her hand continued its assault. For a villager, your kind knows how to create soft clothing. I'm glad I rooted your mind for the instructions. Her hand pulled at her panties, tearing the dainty article easily. As soon as enough of her cunt was exposed the hand dove in, wiggling two fingers inside before pushing them further into her depths. She moaned as they moved in opposite directions, pushing against her insides and stopping, only to crash into her walls once more. The rest of her fingers rubbed themselves along the outside, the thumb playing around with her clit."D-don't touch my nub...ah~" Kiris's thighs squeezed around her hand, the thumb pressing itself hard into the clit. Moan shamelessly, as loudly as you wish. Moan for the whole world to here. For your family, your friends, your coworkers, your superiors. Even for the children you love to take care of, show them how lewd you can be. Because in the end, the only one that would you would care for, is me."Ahhhhhhh!~"Natsumi sat in his lean-to, drawing out a path from the image in his head. He had bought a map in Headen's kingdom to aid, using the roads and walkways to guide his way to each destination. After sketching out with his quill, he put it away and rolled up the map, tucking it into his bag of items before curling up under the lean-to. He was used to sleeping on the ground with nothing over him, so a roof felt like a luxury to get him through the night. His eyes closed and his body slowed down its processes, but his mind still ran aloof with thoughts. He was preparing himself for another long walk. Time was of the essence, and he knew the longer he took, the worse things that can happen.
  
    Chapter Text
    It was another day that the sun rose, another day that Isuka didn't have her ingredients, Natsumi thought to himself. The lean-to was promptly dematerialized as soon as he woke up, being reduced to a talisman with its ink disappearing from it. He picked up the talisman and stored it in his back, double-checking his things before getting up and starting his walk away from the elven kingdom. Now that he had completed his first task, his next was to get the slime of a Humpty egg. Their newborn properties can weaken whoever is hit with it when used properly as an ingredient to a spell. It would involve heading over to wonderland and risking being Ara-ara'ed, if Isuka didn't have a better location for him to go to.
It was a supposedly mountainous cottage, in a corner of an elevated village. There lived a fellow book reader like his superior mage, a slime that she said was "one of many colors". Natsumi wondered what that meant as he trekked up to her house, taking other forms of travel to move faster to her location. All the way he wondered if he had made the right choice. It was pretty far out of his way on his list of tasks, but seeing how the Dark Mage recommended it, he assumed that it was one of the easier tasks to handle.
It was too late to reconsider, as he was already in front of the cottage now. He took a deep breath and stepped up the stairs, going to the door and knocking on it. He waited out in the slight chill, looking around behind him while waiting for the door. Soon the cottage entrance opened, a slime opening the door. She was not as tall as the others, Natsumi estimating only a few good inches on him instead of being a foot higher. Still, what she didn't have in height she made up for in posture. She held a book under her arm, everything seemly wrapped in lamination to keep it protected and dry as her slimy exterior dripped down over it. "What, hadn't I already filed my taxes to the village?" She said, annoyed that she had to answer the door.
"I'm looking for a Humpty Egg," Natsumi said. "I was sent by a Dark Mage to get a container of her essence."
"Dark Mage….ah, you mean the one that sent that sandwich-loving freak. Come in." She walked away from the door inside, Natsumi following her and closing the door behind him. There was barely any natural light coming into her home, the rooms being lit by different types of candles that were arranged to make her home look more like a cave. Natsumi saw someone reading in the corner, his mouth holding a burger as he flipped the pages. He waved to the green-haired person reading, seeing eyes that arched eyebrows staring back at him.
"Is he the one that you were talking about?" Natsumi asked as the red slime motioned him into her bedroom. He looked around it, seeing a small but cozy bedroom. "I don't talk about him. Now, you say you needed Humpty Egg essence?"
"Yes please, I will be grateful if you can supply me with even a bit."
"Then you are in luck." Her slime started shifting color before his eyes, her translucent body turning more oblique as she turned into a different kind of slime. Heart shapes formed on her forehead, looking like a wreath made solely for her. A bowtie formed under her neck as her body finished changing biology as a final cherry on her new form. She left the room, getting Natsumi to follow her into the kitchen. "A vial would be great, but just getting the bare minimum is just asking for trouble to follow." She got multiple small containers, holding her finger over each container as her slimy egg self dripped into the containers. "Have you ever read the old texts?"
"Huh?"
"Have you read old texts? Writings from hundreds of years ago," The slime said, Natsumi shaking his head. "Well, there is this one story of a king. A king that eventually dies after discovering a fate leads him to kill, be scarred, and eventually die from the tail end of the prophecy."
She finished filling the three small bowls, placing covers over them to make sure nothing will spill. "But strangely, he had a conscious. He wasn't a cutthroat killer driven by a prophecy. No, that was his wife, who manipulated him, encouraged him down a path that he could not truly return. His wife wanted it more than him and was dead set on bringing him up to bring herself up further."
"Is there a lesson in this?" Natsumi asked, going to pick up one of the bowls of slime. However, the slime's hand landed on his before he could lift the bowl off the surface, keeping his hand pinned under hers. "There is, being that you don't let others drive you to insanity. But that isn't your issue….your issue is I identify with her." She licked her lips, leering over him with evil intent. Natsumi only stared back, his gears turning to fully understand what she meant.
"...yes?"
"That, that wasn't ominous?"
"Well no, I'm more confused than scared." He tried pulling his hand free, but then the slime moved to fully pin him, lifting his hands from the bowl and shoving him to the floor, sitting on top of him. "I'm saying that I'm going to extort you, ignorant incubus! Is this clear enough for you?"
"Oh yeah I am now scared out of my mind, but what exactly are you going to make me do?"
He looked up at the roof with the slime, seeing the snow that had piled up on it and stuck. The slime held up a shovel and poked it hard. The packed powder didn't even budge, even as she ramped up her effort until she was practically trying to stab the snow in. "As you can see, it doesn't budge."
"Why is there snow on your home?"
"Not relevant. But if you want my slime, you must get this off. I think you can get a ladder from one of the other villagers. You can also use Ren."
"Ren?" He asked. He saw the guy from before approaching the slime from behind, still holding a burger in her mouth like before. "Didn't I tell you to eat that thing?" She asked her, grumbling under her breath when he patted her instead of answering. His chuckles were heard through the soft bread he held as he went outside and down the steps to get the ladder for Natsumi. "He's only going because he knows not to stick around after daring to touch me. Just get your job done so I can punish him later." She reached inside her, taking out a whip from inside her body. She started wiping her slime off it to prepare it to lash against Ren's skin, closing the door behind her to leave Natsumi out in the cold.
Ren appeared back a bit later, holding a ladder under her arm as he trudged up to Natsumi. He set it against the roof and shook it to test if it will hold, climbing up it while Natsumi waited below to follow. Once Ren got on he pointed shuffle and made a "gimmie" motion. Natsumi tossed it up to him, Ren nodding and holding a thumbs up before disappearing from Natsumi's view on the roof. Natsumi started climbing up, but then the snow started falling down on him in clumps. It thudded against his head which each step he took up the ladder. He reached high enough to peer over the roof, where he saw Ren lording over him with a shovel end full of snow.
"Don't you dare…" Natsumi's words fell on deaf ears as Ren slowly moved the shovel over his head. There was no point in going down; the time it would take to get off the ladder would be long enough for snow to hit him right in the noggin. In any direction, it was becoming too late to move without being hit. His only hope lied in Ren having mercy on his light grey hair, already wet from the snow that at fallen onto him before.
Natsumi closed his eyes and waited for the inevitable..and heard the snowfall on the ground behind him. He opened his eyes, seeing Ren holding out a hand to pull him up. "Sorry mate," he said, pulling Natsumi up with him onto the roof. "I didn't notice you when I was getting snow off Viscosa's roof."
"It's alright, but why would you pretend like you had malice?"
"Because it's fun! It was fun for you, right?" He started chucking more snow off the roof, Natsumi using his hands to contribute himself. "If it wasn't fun for you, then I guess it is my bad."
"You seem to like sandwiches a lot," Natsumi noted. Ren stopped shoveling, turning to Natsumi with a blank stare. "I don't like sandwiches, I like borgers."
"Burgers?" Natsumi asked, confused about what Ren said. "Yes, borgers!"
"But you said Burgers. What are borgers?"
"They are burgers!"
"But borgers?"
"Yes, and delicious!" Ren said, dropping into a sitting position on the slanted roof. "Have you had one?"
"I've had a sandwich yes."
"No, have you had a borger?" Ren said, putting down the shuffle while getting something from his pocket. Natsumi picked it up, continuing his work now with a more efficient tool. He got two shovelfuls of snow out off the roof before a burger was held in front of his line of sight. "Try it," Ren said. "It is really good."
"We have to work," Natsumi responded, continuing his shoveling despite his eyesight being blocked. Ren held the shovel down, holding the burger tantalizingly close to Natsumi's mouth. "It was from your pocket…"
"I promise it is as clean as any other food," Ren said. "The borger seal of approval."
"I still don't trust that it's clean, but I guess I'm hungry…" Natsumi took a bite out of it, shrugging as he tasted it and swallowed it down. "It's good yeah?" Ren asked, taking another burger out of his pocket to eat himself. "Yeah, I guess…" Natsumi sat down with him, eating his burger while looking at the view from on top of the house. "Sometimes, I come up here when Viscosa is busy reading. It's quiet and nice….perfect for making burgers."
"You make these in this cold?" Natsumi asked, wondering how could get enough heat to grill on a slanted roof where things can slide off. "It's a gift...but I won't say any more than that."
"Am I gonna have to get it out of you?"
"Only if you eat more burgers with me," Ren responded, taking out a third for Natsumi when he finished the first one. Natsumi stared at him and the burger, deciding whether to take him up on that offer while eating the first one. They did seem to get better with each bite I took, he thought to himself as he looked out at the sky, seeing the lack of anything going on in it but blue and clouds. "I wonder what the Dark Mage is doing right about now…"---------------------------------------------------------
"Thanks for letting us clean ourselves in the back," Headen said, taking off her clothing while the dragon held his paw under the hose. He stood in a large pool, with a garden horse enlargened for larger quantities to come out faster. "Is this even sanitary, or not bestiality?" Isuka asked, her mind trying to figure out why she's taking a shower with the dragon.
"Don't worry, this beast isn't his only form if you know what I mean. Now shoo! you're staring at me naked."
"Don't dark elves take pride in things like public sex?"
"Just because we do doesn't mean we do it all the time. Now leave why don't ya?" Heathen hopped into the pool, hugging the dragon while Isuka headed back inside. She saw Virto testing his watch with Holi, watching him summon small balls from his watch. The watch flashed with light as the balls seemed to be ejected out, dropping onto the floor to bounce and roll around. "How are the tests coming?" Isuka asked. "They are going alright. The additional space I was able to connect to the watch lets me summon things, like getting something from storage."
"Any weapons or protection you were able to summon?" She then asked. Virto pressed a button on the watch, watching a spear slowly come out of the watch. It was like watching a sausage getting formed in the casing, as the sphere took drastically longer than the ball to come out of the watch's screen. When it did, it tilted over and fell onto the floor.
"That does not look efficient."
"Yeah, no crap. I need another way to get stuff, or else I'm sort of a sitting duck in times when I really need something fast. Do you have any idea's Holi?" They both turned to Holi, who was connected to Virto's watch once more to power it while testing its capabilities.
"Well, um….I'm only good with weapons and physical and sexual capabilities. But, I do like it when I can draw things quickly. It is why I always keep my pistol on me, even if my other weapons are taken, or even if I am having a nice time under the sheets. Speaking of which, I'm feeling a bit 'low on energy'-"
"Lalalalalala…" Virto plugged his ears and walked away, making noise to block out any offers of sex that would descend onto his ears. Holi stared at him, watching him walk away with intrigue. "That's the second time I've asked him today…I wonder what has him so scared."
"Second time?" Isuka said. "Well the first time was a joke, but he seems to not want to have sex at all...it makes me excited."
"You're going to rape him?"
"That is crass. I wanted to do something way better...I want to break him~"---------------------------------------------------------
Virto was continued his work in the back of the library, drawing sketches of possible ideas that he could use on the watch. increasing the power of the watch is a good idea, but that would reduce the convenience of it if he had to add something that will involve more space that the watch will take upon his arm. Bulky, as he thought it, as he tried sketching something else. Another idea was increasing the watch's screen where the objects come out, but that would take him back to his first problem of less and less convenience. His penmanship got hasty as he tried searching for the answer, soon filling up the paper full of rapidly drawn sketches and writing disproving his own craft. Being able to bring his ideas to reality wasn't the problem; he had magic on his side to give him what he needed to build it.
The problem was finding the balance between his ideas and reality. He wished for a powerhouse of a watch that could easily be put on. Sleek and simple to use, but built with ingenuity that would rival at least a horny hellhound. He didn't need to be god, he just needed to avoid having sex against his will. Yet, even to outpower a monster girl would probably require the capabilities of a server room, or a backpack with some magic...
In a sudden bout of frustration, he started tearing the paper, as if it was the one that had done wrong for wasting space with all its terrible ideas written onto it. Why isn't this working? he thought to himself repeatedly. Why didn't it at least have one idea that will sate his need for a watch that wasn't bulky? Was he asking too much out of so little space?
"Didn't know you were making confetti," someone said while he was busy tearing his progress to shreds. He turned and saw Holi, leaning against one of the bookshelves while watching Virto. "How long have you been here?" He asked.
"Long enough to see you having trouble. Do you need help dear?" She came over, pulling two chairs with her to the table and sitting down with one. She patted the other one for him, to which he seemed inclined to decline. "Don't worry, I don't come to lure you into sex, and you confiscated my guns, remember?"
He sighed and went over, setting down on the chair. She slowly moved a hand around his waist, sliding his body closer to hers. "So, any progress on your invention?"
"Yes, but that progress is now in scraps. What do you think, I was gonna fuel my watch with confetti?"
"No need for sarcasm, or at least your attempt at it. Maybe you just need a break. Wanna just sit here with me?"
"You're really not going to ask to fuck me?"
"No, but you are." At that moment Holi lifted Virto off his seat, sitting him back down on her lap. She laid his head on her chest, letting his head weight sink in between her soft orbs. "What are you…"
"Don't talk, just relax yourself." She ran her hand through Virto's hair while holding him down with her arm around his waist. "Now, you are feeling veerry comfy in my grasp…"
"Are you trying to hypno-" Holi stuck a finger in Virtos mouth, moving it around slowly while doing a long, drawn-out hush. "No no no, this isn't hypnosis. This is to calm your mind so you can think of the idea you are trying to find. Now, just relax and do nothing."
He was still confused about why relaxing required her to keep her finger moving over his tongue, but he closed his eyes and tried to stop thinking, letting his head wander instead of focusing on anything particular. He felt Holi's finger eventually leave his mouth, her hand now trailing along Virto's waistline. "You're doing it again.." he quietly noted, still trying to relax himself.
"You feel like a sub," She randomly chimed as she moved her hand down onto his thighs. "With the right person, you could make a wonderful alp~"
"Unlike an alp, I won't deny being homosexual, just my feelings for that person."
"Are you saying you won't mind doing it with a guy?"
"The ancient Greeks didn't mind it, so why not? Wait, what they had anything that could give me an idea?"
"See, the relaxation is working. Now sssssh some more…" She got bolder with her touches, lightly squeezing his thigh before moving her hand back up to his-
"Oi, why are you touching my butt?" Virto opened his eyes. Her left arm was still hugging over his stomach, pulling him against her front. Her right arm however extended downward, going behind him and slipping between the space between his buttocks and his lap. She didn't answer anything back, her only response being a tighter, more obvious squeeze of his underside.
"I said stop!" Virto said, pulling the arm away.
"Oh ho ho, why are you flustered all of a sudden?" Holi smirked, watching Virto clutch the hand that was caressing him before. "Why are you touching my butt all of a sudden?"
"Do you not like it?"
"No! I mean, not with you!"
"You're right. As revenge, you can touch my ass." Virto, genuinely surprised, got up and walked away without a word. "Not even one poke? Well then, I guess you can continue relaxing on your own!" Holi got up too, walking the opposite direction before turning on her heel, and going back Virto's way. Whatever her motives be, she was slowly locking herself onto the scientist, following his heat signature into one of the backrooms. She went in as soon as Virto was fully inside the room, closing and locking the door behind her. "What are you doing h-" His question was cut off by chop to the back of his neck, as he fell limp on the floor below. "Now then, where were we before you so violently grabbed my arm?~"---------------------------------------------------------
"So that's why I love Isuka," Natsumi finished, munching on his 15th burger today. Ren nodded and listened along, making a nice spot on the snow roof to sit on without sliding. "I mean, without her, I would very well still be some slave sleeping on a dark murky floor."
"Wow, that sounds way better than how I met Isuka," Ren responded, taking out his own next burger to eat.
"Well, how did you meet her?" Natsumi asked him. Ren whispered into his ear, the incubus' cheeks flushing a faded shade of pink while his facial expressions remained unphased. By the time Ren finished telling him the story, Natsumi turned to him, his face now the shade of a blooming pink flower. "That was the lewdest way to ever meet someone."
"Don't blame me, she's the one that really liked the hugging…but that is how I met her."
"How can you sleep at night knowing that is some mentor's understudy?"
"With the memory of her hands touching mine. Jealous?" Ren wore a smug grin, looking proud of his debauchery with the Dark Mage. Natsumi turned his back towards Ren, not saying anything in response. "Yeah, you're Jealous. Now then, let's finish this last corner before Viscosa makes us her footstools again. With all those borgers I'm feeling alive!"
They got the last bit of snow off her house at long last. After spending hours on end working and chatting, they, at last, went inside to report that they were done. When they told Viscosa, she looked up, looking at the window that had been build into the roof. "Ah, natural light can come in now. Finally, I can read without worrying about candles again."
"Does this mean I don't have to be a leg rest?" Ren asked.
"Oh no, you took way too long to do your job. Now get to it swine." Ren sighed as he got on all fours, crawling in front of the chair Viscosa sat on. Viscosa put both her legs on his back, rolling them around to spread the slime that drips from her a bit more. "Lovely, now Natsumi, you may take what you needed. I would also punish you, but I feel that the guilt from spending an entire day doing nothing but eating sandwiches with suffice."
"Borgers!" Ren protested.
"Swine that are footrests do not talk!" She commanded back, the man going silent, rolling his eyes as a last act of defiance. "Now then, where was I before this mortal interrupted me? Oh yes, take your egg nog and have a safe journey."
"Thank you….also ouch." Natsumi bowed and packed his things, leaving through the way he came as he went back into the village square. It was an easy task, but she was right. He had taken way to long with a simple task and got distracted by a friendly face and a dozen or more borgers, although they were good. I can't let myself do this again, he thought to himself as he embarked on the next part of his journey.---------------------------------------------------------
Virto suddenly woke up. He was in the room where he fainted, but everything had been moved to the side of the room. He was on the floor, the soft, plush floor….
"The floor isn't soft," he said to himself, trying to get up. But something held him down. He pushed hard against the force keeping him pinned, but it only increased in strength, a hand grabbing behind his head and stuffing his face into two luscious boobs for him to motorboat in.
"Can you breathe in there? I've been told many couldn't, so I keep a bit of oxygen there so anyone can enjoy smothering themselves as much as they want~" said Holi, although Virto couldn't see her face as she talked. In fact, even if his line of sight wasn't taken up by two hand-filling knockers, the room was dark enough that he couldn't see at all. "If you were saying anything, I couldn't hear, but I turned the lights out so we could enjoy a bit more...privacy~"
"You're a madman," Virto said, yelling it loud enough that not even the noise-canceling breasts could stop him from sounding loud clear. Holi cooed as he strained his voice, feeling the sound vibrations tickle her sensitive skin like a small vibrator. "Fine then, if you wish to leave me, I'll let go of you as you wish." Virto felt the arms that held him down lift up, moving away from his body. Now free to move, he started pushing himself up but moaned when a sharp sensation erupted from his nethers. His body fell back into Holi's, limp as his dick jumped inside Holi's cunt. "Did the prodigal son return? For me? How cute~"
"I will get out of y- aaah!~" He tried again, and just like last time, it was to no avail. His cock was simply too sensitive to pull out without reaching a climax and slipping back into Holi's arms. "What is the matter Virto? I am simply letting you go as you wish. Have you had a change of heart?"
"Shut up! You're probably doing something to me…."
"Oh, but I have not. Believe it or not, I haven't done anything to you after you first shot your load into me." Suddenly her right arm panel opened, showing her power supply going brighter than it ever did before. "I couldn't tell you this straight, but I am also powered on spirit energy. Although to get it, that would mean seducing you somehow. Unless you were willing to fuck me right then and there."
"But we both knew you wouldn't dare stick into a mamono, so I had no choice but to either be low powered or take the chance of both of us growing attached to each other. Now, do you love me?" With the light-blue light emanating from her arm, Virto could see Holi looking at him, her skin and smile radiating as if it was a mirror reflecting the light itself. He started resigning to his fate, sinking down into her body like a deflated mattress.
"Oh Virto my boy, don't give me that look. It could have been worse you know. You could have been one of those people with a really small one…"
"Really small one...wait. That's it!" He suddenly jumped up, not getting far before falling back down into her again. His lapse of judgment resulted in yet another orgasm, stuffing her muff to the brim once more as they both silently shuttered together. "I know this is a bad time...but I hope you didn't take that comment to heart...oh you're shooting as much as the first time.~"
"No, I just...mm, thought of a solution to me p-problem…b-but I can't do anything if I'm having sex with you!"
"Then let's fuck our brains out, then solve the problem together darling~"
  
    Chapter Text
    Natsumi traded one of his bowls for a larger bag, one that he could put on his back instead of holding it in his hands. With both hands free, it made it easier for him to travel and use his map to guide him to his 3rd task. The next ingredient he needed to acquire was some fairy magic. Mixing things is a tried-and-true method that is useful, but adding fairy magic, according to Isuka, speeds up the creation of potions and makes each one more potent.Of course, it would be hard to just find one, so Isuka was thoughtful enough to write in a spell that would take him to a fairy kingdom. The rest, however, would have to figure out on his own. He recited the spell as he walked, a glow forming on his leg and rising up his body. He kept reading his memory, his body being overtaken with the glow with each word he says until he says the last and disappears into nothingness. His mind blanks out for a second, with him unable to see anything until he appeared in the new location. He saw fairies flying around, his feet standing on soft grass in front of a lake. He looked around, thinking that he was in a park, which he was indeed was. Isuka's spell had teleported him to a kingdom to accomplish his task, but he still had to figure out how to contain fairy magic. And fast, who knew what horrors Kiris was going through right now….
______________________________________________________________________Yuki moaned as Kiris continued to lap at her cunt, her tongue feeling like it was extending itself for the sole purpose of reaching her g-spot. Kiris's spaded tail thrusted in and out of her own pussy, getting her juices everywhere on the bed and her leggings. Yuki mashed Kiris's face against her nethers, Kiris' nose constantly rubbing against her clit. It held Yuki to be tensed up in constant sensation the entire time Kiris ate her out, somehow not pulling herself away to breath like the living being she still was.With a tongue constantly exploring her depths, it didn't take long before the neko came, her cum being sucked up by the succubus' greedy mouth. She planted her lips on her snatch, not letting go until every drop that could come out of Yuki went over her tongue and down her throat. Her tail was plugging her own hole, wiggling around inside her while she orgasmed with her maid.Yuki lifted her hands away from Kiris' horns, but Kiris herself stayed on for a bit longer then left on her own, her face smelling of rose-scented fem juices. She pulled Yuki down onto a lying position, scooting behind her and spooning her. Yuki was still coming down, moaning as Kiris groped her small chest in her hands.W-what did Master do to her nya!? Yuki thought to herself, Kiris's tail snaking it's away back into Yuki's cunt to start another around. "K-kiris, I need to get our tea…aaah, not again!" Her tail started ravishing her pussy, leaving her stuck with Kiris until she and the succubus comes once more and she takes a few seconds to recover. So much for the shy personality…
______________________________________________________________________"Do you have your water tank ready?" Virto said, putting on a vest that seemed to be made of a tight mess. Holi nodded yes, connecting a tube connected to a water tank to her arm. She opened her palm, a hole forming in her hand that water can shoot out from. Reassured that if he catches fire he can be put out, he pressed a button on his watch to power it on. The vest he wore over his clothing started vibrating, the entire material flowing like waves from top to body."It's like it's living," Holi commented, watching the vest move as if wind was blowing up the scientist's body under the vest. "Alright, this is farther than I've ever gotten with nanobots. Now for it to flow down my hands…" He holds out his hands with his palms facing upward, the vest he wore disassembling itself as it flowed down his sleeves, splitting into two groups to go to each hand. In his right formed a sphere, where his left hand the nanobots formed a cube."What about forming a shield?" Holi asked. Virto nodded as the cube disappeared, the nanobots flowing under his clothing, and appeared out his right sleeve to join the sphere. Everything moved to form a handle in his hand, and more to form a small, modest shield. "I have to say Virto….that shield is very small.""The Vest doesn't have many nanobots, which technically, is the width of one millimeter and about as long as the width of my fingernail.""Makes me wanna sue you," Holi said sarcastically, shooting a pellet at the shield, it stretched like latex, tanking the pellet and reforming itself back to normal. "It isn't sturdy, but it's good for protecting you against small objects.""Again, not many nanites to work with." The shield deformed, going back over his clothing and turning back into a vest. "The idea is that instead of taking up space, I can just wear the material I will use." He takes off the vest, placing it back down the chair. "So are you going to make more then?" Holi said, following Virto as he picked up the pellet on the ground. "Of course.""Are you still going to keep the storage in your watch idea?""Maybe…."
______________________________________________________________________Natsumi continued looking around, looking for a fairy that would be willing to help with get their magic. All the fairies in the kingdom, and so far he has had luck with absolutely none of them. No one seemed willing to aid him in his task. He was starting to give up hope, but he shook himself out of it. Isuka was counting on him, and he couldn't give up without trying to his fullest ability. Even if that meant taking a fairy back herself, he thought to himself, getting an apple to eat. There was no use thinking through hunger.As he bit into the apple, he heard and felt something break in his mouth. He put his hand over his mouth, pulling his hand away after the pain dissipated. In his hand was a bit of blood, along with his left fang. Have I been brushing my teeth? He wondered to himself as he groaned again, the light breeze hitting the exposed nerves in the part of the fang left in his mouth. Blood drops were very slow, but they slowly built up in his palm. He started walking around, looking for a place where he could handle it. He ended up in front of a dental care shop, going in through the front door and ending up in a small waiting. There were only two other people there, a couple that seemed to be waiting for someone to come put. He sat on the other side of the room, still holding his hand to his mouth so nothing drips on the chair he sat on.A child eventually came through the door. Holding a lollipop that seemed sized for a human boy rather than a fairy. He flew out happy as can be, his parents going after him as he enjoyed is treat for the visit. After the family left, a fairy came out to him, taking off her gloves while looking at him. Her white hair made her look aged, experience, but the fullness of her made her look like she was in her 20s. She had a blue shirt and a white dentist's coat, with a purple tie being tucked under her coat as if she was wearing a suit. Her dark green eyes looked at his mouth, catching a drop falling down into the tiny puddle in his palm."I see….your fang must have been pretty weak to have broken on an apple. Come, we will fix it in the operation room." She traveled in, Natsumi getting gup and following her through the small door. It was like he was a tall person trying to avoid hitting the fan, but it was manageable to get through. He was directed to sit in a reclining chair, his arms being strapped down onto the armrest, and his chair being pulled back until he was almost laying down flat. "So, the tooth broke on the apple in your hand?" She asked, putting his things in a corner, and the bite-marked apple on the ledge of the skin. He nodded as tools for her to prod and peer into his mouth. She moved a lamp downward into his mouth, two of the floating tools holding his mouth open while she held a mirror to peer at the broken tool."Don't worry if you get drool on me, I know it is awkward for anyone to keep their mouth open for so long…so, how was your day?"Natsumi made a noise in return, the fairy nodding as she continued to gather info on her broken fang. "I'm going to go with that it was fine. Well, luckily it looks like a clean, sudden cut. I should be able to connect the snapped piece back into your gum since you brought it, albeit a bit blood." She picked up the fang piece from his palm, rinsing it in her sink before flying back to his mouth. "You will feel a bit of pain when doing this, so please don't be mad. Oh, what I would give for some non-magical substance that would make it painless…" She put on her gloves, applying magic to the tooth to bring it up. "Hold still please…"
______________________________________________________________________"Has it felt like a long day to you?" Virto asked, sitting on the roof with a cup of water to his side. The strange thing was that there was no one around for him on the roof to talk to. He waited for an answer he was suspected, then came to the conclusion that Holi wasn't indeed hiding somewhere. "I guess she finally stopped…" Virto kept staring down at the nature that surrounded the library. He saw Heathen going around, walking around the perimeter to make sure that Holi did not try anything to escape. Her dragon mate was most likely on the other side."You seem to be thinking of something," went Isuka's voice as she walked carefully over next to him. He shook his head. "Nah, I'm just relaxing. How about you?""I wish I was as laid back…." she admitted. "What if Natsumi is still stuck on getting the second item?""We just have to have faith in him right?" Virto responded. "You trust him right?""Yes but he's not exactly the smartest or most intimidating. He's more of a shota than he is some bulk adventurer.""He's younger than 18?""No! No, just a small frame. I would...never….lets change the subject." She went silent, watching Heathen as she stopped, turned around, and tapped on something invisible. Holi appeared in front of her, seeming to curse under her breath. "Oh look, she tried to escape again.""Think she would ever do it?" He asked her."Eventually…Virto, we also need to be looking for the ingredients.""What?""Think about it. We have been sitting still in my library for a few days now. Holi can no longer keep us limited down. We can move somewhere. We can't just wait for Natsumi to bring things to us.""But I still haven't finished my watch…""As long as you can hold your own, you will be fine with what you have. I'm going tomorrow morning, whether you like it or not." Isuka got up and went back down, leaving Virto to keep drinking water by himself. He watched the sun start to descend down, the blue sky turning a beautiful array of warm colors to signal the end of the day. He finally went in, the nanobots going to his legs and forming boots with thrusts at the bottom. He jumped down, the thrusters slowing him down so he wouldn't break his legs on the fall. He stumbled a bit a fell on the floor, but at least it seemed to work. "Needs a better gas valve," he said to himself, going to the backroom to keep working on his watch.
______________________________________________________________________"You were such a good patient! Usually, someone would even move just a bit." The dentist said while she took off her gloves after she finished sealing the crack with some dissolving glue. She plucked a lollipop from her desk and placed it in his hand. She quickly undid the bindings to free his hand and took out the instruments that were still holding his mouth open. "You're free to go now unless you have any other issues you wish for me to aid in.""Actually," he started, putting the lollipop in his mouth. "Do you know of a way to contain fairy magic? If not I might have to put you in a jar.""Oh, your joke is most hilarious…" She chuckled while cleaning the instruments, looking back to see his serious look. "Oh, you….you're going to firefly me?""I apologize in advance…" He pulled out three talismans from his back before writing on all three of them, seamlessly flowing through them with his quill. He then stacked all of them, watching it shine briefly as entrances start closing and sealing themselves to keep the fairy trapped. She couldn't beat the door, the door locking itself as she crashed into it. She desperately tried opening it, looking over to see the incubus leer over her with a glass container that he poked holes into. She didn't see lifelessness in those eyes. She saw a will to succeed in his task, no matter what the cost may be - and lifelessness."Can we bargain? I truly do not know! All I do is put my magic into instruments and…""Can I have one of the instruments then?" He said. His movement of the container paused, seeing a more humane, more sane way through this step. Her breathing calmed down as she was spared a moment more to not be kidnapped. She started darting around, looking for something unneeded that she could pawn off to him. Her drawers were out of the question, and she always only had tools that she used in the room. What about lollipops….no she might get into trouble with the locals if a kid walks in for their checkup and doesn't get a treat for after."What of your apple?" She said, pointing to the one she washed on the sink edge. What if I….put the magic in there?""That could work. Do it." He stepped back, the fairy flying quickly to the apple and making it float in the air. "Will the magic stay?""Yes, I promise…" at least she hoped. She gave the apple over to Natsmi, the incubus plucking it out of the air and looking at it. He put the apple in his backpack, nodding as he put the lollipop back in his mouth and left the building. She waited until he was clear of her shop before collapsing on the floor, breathing heavily and relieved she wasn't taken. She looked at her place while propping herself next to the door frame. She spied something left in the chair he sat on in the waiting room - a pile of coins for her as payment."I'm so confused…" she said, still catching her breath. It was all she could muster, after all.
______________________________________________________________________It was night once more, and the moon had come out to shine. Kiris's once pristine and perfectly fine bed was covered in a layer of arousing musk that had come from her constant masturbation. Her tail had embedded itself into her pucker, while her hand was shoving itself up her whole. Hours on end will eventually loosen up a hole to larger targets, which a certain succubus in constant arousal had managed to accomplish in a time that would have set a world record.She screamed one last time as her hand was drenched in girl cum, finally collapsing on the bed. Her hand slowly moved itself out of her pussy, settling to rest to the side of her, she panted and stared up, her body finally calming down after a long, long session in heat. Feeling tired? Went her master's voice in her head."You...you return…." She answered back, fading in and out as her body was getting itself ready to have some long deserved rest. I've always been with you. Do you love your new body yet?"It is so good...I never knew I could experience constant heaven such as this~"Perfect. Just perfect, you will need that true mindset for later...
______________________________________________________________________Virto was hard working in the back, going on many cups of milk that he had gotten from Isuka. He was refining the nanite design, changing the mold to be better and more streamlined."Virto!" Isuka said, busting into his door. She had changed robes, in something with a darker purple, and a bottom that touched the floor like a bridesmaid dress. She also had a long staff, with a mamono emblem on one side and an order emblem on the other. Virto remained unfazed by her entrance, continuing to modify is design while looking through a lens."We must go at once, we cannot lose any more time!""But it is 1 in the morning…." Virto said, the tiredness being heard in his voice. "That's why you should have slept. You have a fortnight to decide. I will be outside gathering the rest." She left the room, leaving Virto to continue perfecting his work.

    "So you made me rush to catch up to you to get a rock you could just magic up?" Virto said, having formed a flashlight in his hand.
"It is not that simple," Isuka said, using the light to guide their way. "Lapis Lazuli, as you call it in your world, is a magical element in ours. It is not something that just making it appear via magic will also do. To be able to use its true gifts, we must get it naturally. What do you humans use it for? Well, humans in your dimension?"
"Minecraft."
"What is this Minecraft?"
"I would show you but I don't have a laptop on me. By the way, is Natsumi going to be gunning for this one as well?"
"Yes," Isuka said, imagining him running out of the fairy kingdom, while simultaneously reading his memory. "I would tell him, but I think it would be better for us to meet up. I can summon my cauldron and we can create my spell there, at the beach."
"Wait." Virto stopped, Isuka stopping as well. "Why pause our journey? Did your nanobots stop operating?"
"No, why are we going to a beach? I thought we were going to a cave!" Isuka rubbed the back of her neck, looking away. "Well…"
"We are going to mine the lapis right? It's not like it's all gone and eroded away…"
"Well Virto, um...this will be awkward to comprehend."
____________________________________________________________________________
"What do you mean it's not for sale!?" Natsumi said, slamming his hands down. The Cancer kept polishing her rock, giving the incubus a confused look. "I just really like this rock. I'm sorry, but I can't sell this Lapis."
"Not even for some rare essence of a wonderland mamono?" He tried, taking out once of his cases of humpty egg essence to trade. She shook her head. "If I just give it up like this, my collection would be incomplete!"
"Then what if I give you a stone for a stone?" Isukas voice rang as she came up to Natsumi. "You have another lapis?" The Cancer asked, her eyes widening as Isuka made one appear in front of her. "Oh my! Of course, here is!" The Cancer willingly gave her the magic lapis, replacing the space left by Isuka's stone. She ogled at it while Isuka shooed Virto and Natsumi away from her, whispering to both of them that she didn't know if the Cancer was picky about the properties of Lapis.
____________________________________________________________________________
"So, it seems that you have gotten the ingredients that I didn't have myself. Now I can create a spell to weaken our enemy…" Isuka said, looking at all the ingredients laid out. She poofed up a cauldron, a white fire lighting under it as the bottom instantly began to glow a hot red. She poured some water in, mixing in the rest of the ingredients as Virto and Natsumi chatted with each other to the side. She had poofed up Virto's tools from his workspace so he could continue modifying his nanites, Natsumi watching over the shoulder as Virto looked through the magnifying lens, continuing to change the shape of the nanite, then watch it wiggle in the grip that sat still on the dirt ground.
"I didn't know Isuka had another human," He said, Virto not budging as he took the nanite out from its hold and held it up to his eye with tweezers. "You're very silent you know that right?" Natsumi tried again, still watching over his shoulder.
Virto continued to work in silence, listening to the bubbling of Isuka's cauldron and the other sounds of nature around them. Since they were working near a beach, that meant hearing waves crashing over and over in the background, and seeing harpies fly around, occasionally circling around them before continuing on their way.
"You're like Isuka, so focused on her work," Natsumi commented next. "I can't seem to talk to neither of you when you're both so deep in tasks. What are you making?" He asked once more, watching Virto open his watch, and place the nanite inside. He closed it and turned on the watch, his lab coat vibrating before stopping. "It is done," Virto said, gathering his tools off the ground and heading back to Isuka. She was also done with her task, reaching into the cauldron to take out the solid lapis that had sunk to the ground. It seemed to glimmer less, with some of it's magic being used in the yellow-green substance that filled the cauldron.
"You both still hadn't said much to me…" Natsumi said, looking at the two stare at each of their finished products. Isuka started packing her liquid into small containers, giving them to Virto to store in his watch.
Headen and Holi came to the three, riding on the dragon. "Will she be trouble Headen?" Isuka asked her, looking at Holi watch from on top of the dragon. "Night will keep her tame. So, are we ready to go save a succubus?"
"Yes, all thanks to my lovely underling." Isuka patted Natsumi's head, the incubus' existence finally being acknowledged. "After a few days of fetching, we can now finally go storm her castle. And her automaton here is gonna take her to us."
"You can't make me squeal," Holi said, folding her arms. "I will never tell….wait...why would I bring them to you Di? Hold on mates I'm getting a call." Her ears seemed to vibrate like an earpiece as she hopped off the dragon, walking down the coastline to get some privacy.
"What do you think she's talking about?" Headen asked.
"Di is probably talking to her through her mind, just like she did Kiris. I wish it was this obvious before," Isuka said. The four, and the dragon, waited for Holi to come back, the automaton returning as she was finishing up her conversation. "Yes...yes I will tell them," she said, saying her goodbyes and tapping her ears to end the call. "So, it seems that instead of us breaking into her domain, she just wishes to invite you! She says that she'll enjoy seeing you try."
A portal opened up behind holy, seeming to lead to nothing but the vastness of space. "Don't let the visuals fool you, this goes to Di's home. Now then, don't fall behind now, we don't want to stave off plot any longer!"
____________________________________________________________________________Some time later…
"And that was basically my encounter with the incubi," Viscosa said, her slimy hair being tended to by the slime. "He just came and left, never to be seen again. I don't like people like that, treating me like I'm some sort of side quest. Do you understand that Neribu?" The Cancer nodded, putting more hair conditioner on her hands before returning to her slime hair. "Hey, why do you come here to get your hair done and body polish?"
"You have products specifically for a slime. They make me look nice…" She responded, going back to reading her newspaper.
"Oh, thanks," She said, smiling from the complement.
  
    Chapter Text
    "So she's waiting on the other side?" Isuka asked. One by one the group came through the portal, following the automaton as she walked onto a glimmering gold path. Around it laid darkness, the path illuminated by lamps that were placed to the side. As they walked past, Natsumi went to one and peered in. A tiny Chochin was floating around inside, her natural light acting like the lightbulb of the contraption.
"Don't touch those Natsumi, we don't know if the Lilim rigged it," Isuka said over her shoulder, Natusmi catching up with the group while they walked down the path. "I thought you said we wouldn't be teleporting into space."
"Well, you are on a path to her home aren't you?" Holi responded. "After walking for a bit, the castle appears. But for it to appear, no one can have second thoughts about turning back. Think of it as a sort of mantrap." Holi stopped suddenly, raising a hand to let the others behind her pause as well. She reached her hand out, grabbing onto a knob that wasn't there.
She made a door-opening motion, opening nothing to reveal another path to go on. A door-shaped hole seemed to disturb the lack of objects on the road, leading to the interior of another location. "I believe this is where we part ways."
"You're not coming with us?" Isuka asked.
"My weapons are still confiscated. I would prefer to have them when I come back truly. Dark Elf, may you take me back?" Holi said, walking back to the portal. Heathen and Night turned around, following her out. It left Isuka, Virto, and Natsumi to go in, the door closing behind them with a large crash. "Natsumi, stay at the entrance," She said, giving some extra talismans to him for protection. "Watch our backs."
"Yes, Ma- Isuka." He took it and started patrolling around, looking for anything out of the ordinary at the entrance. Isuka and Virto went forward, Virto's labcoat disappearing to form a grenade launcher in his hand, the spare nanites turning into arm sleeves for him to access later. "Do you have your explosion spells?"
"If you mean ammo, then yes. I never took the storage ability out of the watch."
"That is good. The moment we see this "Di" figure, I am going to look for Kiris. Just make sure however you do it, she comes into contact with the spell." As the two walked, the walkway widening out into a large hall. Everything was sapphire blue, with yellow diamond shape started painted onto the color. Pillars lined the sides, supporting the massive weight of the room and the floors above.
"It is grand isn't it?" Came a disembodied voice. Virto immediately shot at it, sending a grenade full of the spell arching towards where the voice was. A loud poof sounded and coughing ensued, coming from where a semicircular arch of steps went up, leading to a platform in the back of the grand hall. Yellow smoke obscured her body from view, but the voice seemed to be weakening if the coughing indicated anything.
"Virto! What if that wasn't her?"
"Well, then I am sorry." A gas mask formed on Virto's head as he charged up to the smoke, popping another grenade shell out of his watch and loading it into the grenade launcher. Isuka sighed and went a different direction, looking for the room that Kiris was locked away in.
A fan formed on Virto's shoulder as it blew away the smoke, showing an elegant yet simple throne, and someone that had fallen to the ground in front of it. Her body looked composed of the same stars and dark matter that they had walked in outside, her eyes nothing but glowing blue orbs that someone could look to and tell what they were. Her hair flowed like a flower, gracefully cascading down her body onto the floor she sat on like a waterfall.
"I thought you were a lilim," Virto said through the mask. "You are a lilim, right?"
"I assume you're the Virto that I've heard so much about. A human that was teleported into this world...that is something I thought I would never hear again…although, it would be fun to play with." She raised her hand to Virto's head, but nothing came, nor shot out of it. Virto waited for something to pop inside his mind or ensnare him so he couldn't move, but nothing happened. "It looks like the potion Isuka made worked."
"Who is this Isuka fellow?" She asked, looking at her hand. "This is a strange new position I find myself in, powerless against a human who combined his strengths with another. You must feel very proud of this, don't you?"
"I'm not falling for hubris. I have watched way too much television," Virto responded back.
"Not even for emotional tugging?" Her answer was another spell grenade, as she started coughing once more as it surrounded the both of them. "What is this? Spell draining? Power inhibition? A counter or blocking spell?"
"I don't know, I only made the grenade launcher. Now, where's Kiris you twat?!"
"Before I answer that, riddle me this...what is your favorite show? I had my tastes as well before you know….I was also pulled into this world through a portal."
"..."
"What, no response? Too much of a mental bomb to drop onto you?" She asked, holding her shoulder over her mouth and nose. "Now I have your curiosity. You want to know more do you?"
"You could be lying," Virto said, pointing the muzzle to Di's forehead. "Yes I could, but why would I lie? I prefer to do my string pulling through convincing, not dragging others through the mud to reach my goals."
"This is the same person that monsterized then proceeded to kidnap a villager as what, some servant?"
"Yes, and I can see how it can be seen that way," Di said. "But haven't you ever wondered if Kiris might have actually wanted it? She didn't have to listen nor engage me when I spoke to her in her mind. She could have decided to hate me, to resent my actions, and I would have eventually faded from her memory. But she didn't; she was curious, and in the end, her true feelings won out against staying affiliated to the little bit of order that she had left in her."
"That sounds like a stretch…" Virto said.
"Then tell me human. I have been around both universes for some time, and I know that things tend to be not permanent. As fleeting as an explosion."
"What do you want me to say to that?" Virto said. That isn't really a question at all....
"What I want you to answer to that is, why haven't you pulled the trigger to renew your effect?" She plucked the grenade launcher from him, grabbing on to his watch with her other so nothing can be done. "Yoink."
"Crap!"
"Don't worry, as I said, I don't hurt people. Instead, I will show you..." Her eyes started glowing brighter as his vision faded, a constant stream of light pounding on his retinas as he fell asleep under her spell.  Damn himself, now his forgetfulness is going to get him killed….____________________________________________________________________________
"...rto. Virto?" Di said, bapping his cheek to wake him up. He groaned and open his eyes, seeing a certain celestial being looking down on him. "Frick!" He said, scooting back and looking around. He saw multiple small portals, looking a bit like a screen into another place. He was able to make out people moving inside the views into other lives, seeing wildly diverse events taking place.
"This is where I watch everything that takes place before me. You would not believe it, but I discovered this place by accident." She walked up to one of herself, controlling a large ring around her. "It was like I had been here before, or a version of me was."
"What does this have to do with me?" Virto asked. One by one, he saw visions of himself as well, doing so many things that were reduced to a few seconds of screentime as it flashed before his eyes. "This is you Virto." She pointed to the portal he was looking through. "Just like me, you seemed to have lived a plentiful life already." She moved another one closer to him, showing him sitting on a lilim's lap. "This is you, accepting your position under my control."
"Impossible, I would never be seduced like that!"
"You weren't. The one that seduced you, which you also married, is here." She moved another one to him, showing a demon and a male inari kissing each other, both of them wearing wedding wear while the bells rang around them.
"I married a demon?"
"No no no, you were the demon."
"Wha-Alright, now you are pulling my leg. I don't mean to be rude, but I'm not gay."
Di chuckled, pushing the portal away from both of them. "I thought the same about some of mine, rejecting that I ever did the things I did. But you know what you find to realize?" She makes one of her own portals appear, showing herself petting a dragon the size of a beach ball. "I never thought I could do this, but wouldn't you know, I now have a dragon girl under my wing...or arm. One of these things is bound to happen to you as well Virto. Some painful. Some stupid, and some...preferable, but if you try to reject all of them..."
"...Then you lose say in the matter." Virto finished, looking at everything. Still, some of the things are impossible to believe that would happen to him. He looked up and down until he saw one of him staring at himself, his clone having pick pupils. "I cloned myself?"
"More of we, or our other "we"s. But, if you want that to be the thing…"
"I still don't trust you."
"Don't worry, it won't happen immediately. But if you are ever willing to, I will be here, patiently waiting for you to play with." The imagery disappeared around them, revealing her throne and the hall that they were in again. That grenade launcher is was always there, a quick jog down the stairs. She probably won't be fast enough to stop him…
"You have said you have watched a large amount of television," Di said, seeing the grenade launcher. She didn't seem to care that he could get it, however, reclining back into her throne. "I think we both know what plot point is coming next."
"What is your choice be Virto? Will you decide to play, or will you decide to find out the long way?"____________________________________________________________________________

"...So then I blasted the maid with a slime spell so she'll stick to the walls. It was easy to get Kiris out then," Isuka said, walking back down the path to the portal, holding Kiris while she floated behind her, like a balloon being held by a kid. Natsumi was asleep on Virto's back, napping like the shota like he was. "Sounds like it was an easy battle to fight," Virto answered back.
"No no, it was a pretty hard task to accomplish. She started wielding a scythe, so I had to adapt to her sty…." Isuka continued on, but her voice had faded from Virto's mind. His mind was still on the image of him as a clone, and Di's offer. He wondered if she was being genuine, and she really was from the same universe as Virto was.
"......so then I tried a rust spell, but it like the blade was immortal. I infer that she was as immortal as her blade appeared since she seemed to shrug off my elemental spells."
"Yeah, yes," Virto said nodding along. "Hey, um, I need to go check something when we get back."
"Check?"
"Refine my nanites, practice flying around, that kind of thing." He was, of course, lying. Nevertheless, it worked, and after putting Kiris to sleep, he left the house to go do his thing. Headen and Night had left, and Holi went back home after retrieving her weapons back from the library. That left the mage and the succubus, studying spells with her incubus and sleeping respectively.
So, are you ready? Di asked him as he walked through the woods. He spied a portal formed between two trees, seeing her wave her hand from the other side. "Since you seemed accepting now, I took the liberty of saving you travel."
"Don't confuse my curiosity for acceptance. I just want to cover my bases…"
"Of course," she said, stepping aside and smiling as he entered into her hall once more. "Don't you have any more rooms in this place?"
"Only when I need them. Now then," she sat down on her seat, patting her lap for him to sit down on. "No other chair?" He asked. After she shook her head, he sighed and plopped down on her lap. "I've been waiting to do this for a long time Virto...."
"Make a clone? Just a simple spell, right?"
"If it was as simple as that, I wouldn't have looked forward to it~" She tapped his head, Virto instantly falling asleep in Di's lap.
...
He woke up in a new place, a location without ground, or a sky. A space filled with nothing but himself, floating like a broken piece of a satellite. Immediately he felt odd, like he as sick and his body was just not starting to fight the illness out of him. He went into a tumble, his woozy body unable to figure out what was going on. That's when he started to separate.
It was like watching mitosis, except instead of looking through a microscope, he was experiencing it himself. It was like someone was grabbing slime, and pulling only a specific part out of him. He groaned as he split into two, his other self looking paler than he was.
"More," he or they felt the voice inside his head go as the process repeated again. Confused groaning as he split again, his third self being even paler than the second. Then a fourth had been made, then a fifth...it was like looking into a requiem stand of himself, watching as even paler versions of himself were extracted like cells that forgot to carry over the original mass that let them split properly.
With each split, it felt as if he had lost blood. He couldn't keep himself upright, spinning around as he watched himself continue to replicate like he was recording a view of his recording. Pale, and even paler version came out, hundreds, thousands, until the very definition of pale was being redefined.
"It is still not deep enough...we must go deeper…" the voice waved in and out like a bad connection, his abdomen tightening as he was split more. The line of himself was starting to turn like a logarithmic graph finally growing long enough to have a curve visible in it.
Turns turned to an outward spiral has he continued to be duplicated, his unconsciousness being dug into to the limits of sheer concepts and theories. His palest self was starting to regain color, reaching beyond pale to unpale itself. It was notably in his eyes, the faintest hue of pink that could be seen dotting palest Virto's seeing orbs. He watched as the pink became more apparent, at this point reaching quadrillions of duplications. The process only ramped up from here, his eyes losing focus as he could no longer see himself from so far away. Counting the number of times a new clone was made was starting to hurt his head, the number of digits itself turning into a struggle to fully grasp. He stopped moving, focusing all his might on counting until he could no longer. He had given up, given in to the herculean task of reaching the depths of his unconsciousness as the clones kept coming. All he could do now is wait.
A new number popped in his head, G64. The number had reached high enough to only be able to be described by labels such as Graham's number, and multiplications of those labels. Soon the labels preceded his knowledge, appearing as alien to him as to any normal person. On his second try, it had passed in a fleeting moment. He could do nothing but sleep, and wait for the growing dullness in his head to end…
Before he knew it he was back in Di's lap, shifted to the side a bit. He looked up, seeing Di's eyes closed as she marinated in the success of her long-awaited task. He looked to the side, seeing the clone that the being he sat on had promised what felt like an eternity ago. He stared back like a mirror, his eyes as pink it was as possible for a human being to see. His hair was streaks of pink and white, and his color had come back into him as if he wasn't cloned into oblivion at all. Virto looked towards his nethers, seeing no sign of contact or undressing being done while he was trapped in his mind.
Maybe she really wasn't lying...
  
    Chapter Text
    Piano music softly spread around the tavernas patrons of all walks of life gathered. Non-holstaur cowgirls talking to anthropomorphic sharks, trappy imps getting along with a male Cheshire at another table. A satyros went around, serving drinks to everyone, eventually coming across Di and Virto sitting in the corner."What is this place exactly, and why do I need a suit?" Virto said. "Well, the rabbit that runs this place wishes for only our best attire," she responded."Well then, why aren't you changing?""I am a celestial entity. I don't need to do a thing. Now, I'm going to meet up with my other playthings. I will meet you outside after you are finished fulfilling another prophecy." With that, she got up and went to another table, where there was a grey and black-furred Cheshire cat making tea. She left Virto on his own, the scientist humming while looking around bored.Alright think Virto, what was one of the windows you saw, he asked himself, looking at each person. He had already made the weird clone of himself yesterday, but today he had to do some other things. "I just need to make doubly sure I don't end up with him," he said, seeing a cloaked figure getting punch from the refreshment table."I get powers from him?" Virto asked Di earlier, seeing the hands in the portal with an odd color. Di nodded, closing the portal. "If you wish to run through all of these, this event would be a good place to start..."If he remembered correctly, he supposedly got it quite a bit of trouble with him. He waited until he finished his drink, watching me making a beeline for the bathroom.He made his move, getting up as casually as he could and acting like he really did have to go number one. However, his progress walking to the bathroom was stalled by the manager landing right in front of him. She wore a black skirt and a red vest, her velvet eyes and wide grin aimed directly at him. Her floppy pink bunny ears perked up like a dog seeing a mailman. "You look like a new member. Whale cum to our di- I mean restaurant! And by ours…""It is yours?" he tried, wondering if she just said whale cum instead of welcome. "Yes! I, Melko, am the proud owner of this restaurant. Trust me! You wouldn't find anywhere else better.""I'm glad, hey I got to use the bathroom so-""Wait!" She said, grabbing his arm. "To use the bathroom, you must pay the lifetime bathroom pass fee.""But I don't have any money…" He wasn't lying. Between upgrading his watch, getting Kiris back, and hanging out with Di (for his own motives, of course…), he didn't really try to make any money. "Don't worry, I'll just take your memes then." She said. She pulled out a handgun, cocking it and pressing it to his temple. Her bright smile turned to an evil smug smirk, the lighting on her face altering to a dark shadow to match her demeanor shift. "Now, bitch."____________________________________________________________________________The clocked figure was washing his hands when he heard a commotion approach the door. He kept on with his usual, going to the electric dryer to heat-blow the water off as something hit the door. One, two pistol shots rang before it opened, A green-haired dude leaping inside and closing the door back. His hand stayed on the knock, some wave of grey liquid flowing from his hand to lock him inside, and whoever shot out. He watched the lab coat guy catch his breath, resting on the door while some pounded on it. "Hi…I'm...Virto.""Can you open the door? I have somewhere to be." As he asked to get out, the lights in the bathroom went out. Complaints and groans came from beyond the door; it seemed like the lights went out on the other side as well. "Sorry!" Went a high-pitched voice. "Raiju Melko said she wanted cheese or no electricity!""That sucks," went Virto, a flashlight clicking on in his head. "Well, I can always try to fix it.""It could be a power breaker shutting itself off," the cloaked person said, a glowing blue hand forming in front of him. "I could go check with you.""Sure."____________________________________________________________________________The two of them stared at the circuit breaker, seeing multiple holes in it as the wires that ran through it looked frayed. Wires could be salvaged, but there would need to be completely new parts for the power to be able to come back on safely.2 hours later…"We did it!" Virto said, watching the clocked man put in the last screw. Virto flipped the switches on the circuit panel, watching as one by one the lights came back on in the large restaurant. Music started playing again, the water fountain started working. Everything was back to normal, and it only took a trip to the hardware store!"Yeah...hey, I'm Ian. It was nice working with you.""Same. I'm glad you told me your name though, it was getting awkward just calling you nouns.""I hear ya, but I think these wires are going to snap," Ian said, looking at the frayed, exposed wiring. The gunshots screwed them up, so now they are in danger of failing. "Besides, we haven't turned on the switch for Melko's bedroom.""Because last time we tried that the circuit breaker overloaded?" Virto said, Ian nodding. "Luckily, the last time we went to the store, I managed to snag this." He pulled out a blue octahedron and opened the panel again, rerouting the power through the crystal. "What about the wires?" Virto asked. Ian took a dagger and cut his hand, letting some blood drop onto the wires. "Just rub that along the wires to coat it. My blood should act like insulation.""I don't think blood works like that, but we can give it a sh-OCK fuck!" Virto made the mistake of not thinking the circuit was on, getting a nasty shock through his body. He didn't know it then, but the power of the crystal shocking him was enough to fuse the blood to his skin, the blood soaking in and dispersing through his body…"Man, that was a nasty one," he said, waiting for Ian to finish laughing so he could turn off the power again. Five minutes later, the wires were properly coated in blue magic hand blood, safely this time. Virto flipped the switch to the power, making sure to turn on the bedroom switch along with all the others. When nothing seemed to shut down after 5 minutes, they closed the panel and yeeted the tools into some corner of the restaurant. "I still can't believe you did that," Ian said, swiping a croissant from a table to eat while they walked back to Virto's table. "I mean, touching a live wire?""Yeah….so…" Virto was thinking of a snarky comeback, but his vision started to swirl as Ian's DNA was spreading and duplicating itself in his hands. They pulsed with uncontrollable power, being detrimental to his health rather than enhance his ability. He fell over, a slow but unstoppable drop to the floor. He fell unconscious before landing in a large blue hand, stopping him from hitting his head and causing more trouble to himself.Virto woke up at his table, opening his eyes just in time to see someone splash water in his face. He wiped the water from his eyes before getting spaced again. "Well, it looks like he's awake now Ian. By the way, you both cannot sue me for the weird hands he has now," Melko went away, but not before quickly pouring the rest on Virto and scampering off."Come back here you trigger happy- wait, weird hands?" He looked at his hands, panic starting to set in as he saw his hands turning gold and black. He tried frantically waving them in case it was paint, but it looked as stuck onto his body as his own skin. He turned towards the cloaked man, who had brought out a bunch of vials and a slightly larger one to mix things into. "What happened to me!?" Virto exclaimed. "Am I going to die?""No…..and yes. Try this." Ian gave him a vial of blue liquid to drink. "It will probably halt the effects my DNA.""Probably?!""Well, last time this happened it didn't go so well, which is why you must drink it now."Virto, near on panic, took a swing from the vial, the swirling headache in his head disappearing as it went down his gullet. He sat back down, looking at the progress of the gold on his hands. They stopped short of his wrists, staying limited to his hand. He sighed with relief, Ian also relieved. "Good, now we just need to figure out how to contain the damage. You didn't have anywhere you needed to be right?""Even if I did, I think my clone should be able to hold down the fort while I'm gone..."____________________________________________________________________________"Isuka?" Kiris said, pulling her with her spade tail while she drank from her teacup. Isuka looked up from her book. "Yes?""Have you noticed something off about Virto lately?" Kiris asked, pointing to where Virto was. They saw him drawing a bloody river on an isle, cackling under his breath, but loud enough for the sound to carry over in the quiet library. "He hasn't been talking about Earth things lately, and his eyes are pink.""Maybe he's taking a break from tinkering?""To draw a bloody river?""Yes, I can see your point. Should we go over to check on him?" She asked. Kiris nodded and walked over, tapping Virto on the shoulder as he drew in green grass around the winding river. "Virto?""Yeeeeeaassss~" His yes came off sinister and like a lamia, as he turned around on his seat."W-well, you seem different lately…" She watched his eye twitched as he stared at her. "Different?" he uttered, scratching his chin as he struggled to comprehend what she meant. He was always the same Virto, just the best piece of him, extracted and picked for use. "I don't know what you mean, I'm just drawing Kiris~""You're painting blood in grass, and all that you say seems to end in sexual undertones. I should know.""I do not know what you're talking about, but if you are implying that you would like to go behind the shelves…~" totally-not-clone Virto shot a wink to Kiris, Kiris blushing before pushing down her skimpy clothing and walking back to Isuka. "So, is he strange?""H-he wanted to have sexual intercourse, a-and I panicked and..aah~" she let out a soft moan as her tail came out of her cunt, dripping with moisture. "S-sorry…""No no, this was informative. He has never drawn before, much less enable sexual interaction. In fact, he actively made sure Holi knew not to lewd him...your suspicion may be warranted." Isuka placed down her book, making sure to put a bookmark where she left off before neatly closing it. "What should we do?" Kiris asked."We should prepare to confront him." Isuka teleported both of them away, leaving the cackling scientist to continue working away at his unsettling piece…____________________________________________________________________________"How are you feeling Virto?" Ian asked as Virto tried moving his golden hands. "Well, my hands are now shiny and maybe metal, but my headache, so I don't really know right now.""Better confused and sarcastic than dead. Do you feel this?" Ian asked, pinching the back of Virto's hand. They both winced, Ian shaking his corresponding hand as Virto shook his. "So I can still feel pain, but why did you feel it?""Same DNA, same feelings. You are not going to die, but the antidote is going to take time to run through your system. In the meantime, I'm going to get some more food." Ian left Virto to look at his hands, staring off into the semi-glossy texture onto someone cleared his voice. Virto looked up from his hands, seeing a man in a white and red kimono blocking the view of the rest of the restaurant. Why does he look familiar… Virto thought as he waved, the man scooting beside him. "Sorry, my mother wanted me to clean out my bedroom for her, so I decided to come here instead.""Oh, well, that is fine I guess. You have a nice dress.""This is a kimono, are you new here?" He seemed taken aback. People seemed to just know the type of clothing around here, but he…"Yes actually. 1st day here and I got held at gunpoint by the manager, and now I am about to die because I shocked some DNA onto my hands." He held up his hands, the material making it look like he was wearing gloves instead of it being his actual skin. "I would say this day is going pretty terrible so far.""Don't mind Melko, she just likes to joke around a lot. I could make your day better, if you would like," he offered."Thank you, but what could a man in a kimono do?""You don't see my form? I must have not changed yet. Give me a moment…" his hair lit on fire, turning pure white as fox ears grew from his head, catching ablaze with the same flames. Tails shot out from behind him like an airbag in a crash, filling the space between his back and the corner booth they both sat it. His face began to appear on his face, his skin turning more white, and red rings forming around his eyes, the top corners of the eyerings turning into a flaming point. His pupils turned into silts surrounded by yellow irises."You're…" Virto started to realize who he was, remember the wedding vision he saw. He started to slid away on the red leather padding, scooting to the opposite end of the seating. "No no, I'm just a yokai, wait." One of his tails grabbed his leg, sliding Virto back over to him. "Are you scared?"No! I'm just not into you! "No, it's just awkward…." Virto said, looking away. He looked back when felt someone messaging his hand, seeing the inari rubbing his thumb his hands. The golden color started retreating, shifting away into is watch. "This looked worrying, so I'm putting it in this contraption." He pointed to the watch, watching the gold flow into the top. "Feeling better?""But...how?" Virto was confused. Did the yokai hold the power to heal him? "Well, in this restaurant, I've learned anything is possible, as long as both parties are okay with it. So, I am using my magic to help.""Thank you…" Virto said, noticing that the watch changing as it took in more of Ian's DNA. Its sleek black look turned blue with gold lines zig-zagging to and fro across the sides and wrist strap. The DNA was enhancing it, but how?"There, your hands are fixed, but I'm sorry I messed up your device." He poked Virto's watch with one of his fingers, his red fingernail tapping the screen."It is alright. Maybe it's for the be…" He saw Vargas take some sake out of his tail and slide it in front of him. "...tter?""My repayment. Do you want to talk a bit?""W-well…" He stared into the sake, wondering if it would be a good idea to get drunk. "I understand, but I swear on my sister's domain I will monitor over you." He put his hand over his heart. "Yokai's honor.""N-no it's not that, I am just...uneasy around you…""Well, maybe the sake can help put you at ease," he said smiling. He did seem friendly and probably did just saved his life."I suppose…"____________________________________________________________________________"Virto has been in here for so long," Kiris said, holding her tail like a lasso. "When can we go in?""I guess now, now one...too..three!" They both busted in, holding ropes to tie the Virto up before he could flee, but instead, they were greeted to a lady cleaning herself up. She was faced away from them, her body concealed by Virto's lab coat. She hummed some classical music, putting makeup on her face. "Do you people know the March of a Sabbath? Of course, you don't, since it is an Earth song.""Who are you, before I tie you up out of spite?" Isuka said, the lady turned around to face them. She was a human, her body looking untainted and completely naked. Kiris blushed and left the room, saying sorry as she ran away embarrassed. Her hair was in the middle of being dyed white from green, only going to her shoulders. Isuka looked down, seeing a bucket full of cut green hair. Her eyes were still pink, like the Virto from earlier. "Do you like my breasts? I thought of something absurd, but C-cups were just elegant enough for a Lilim.""Where is Virto?""Virto, my lovely original, should be back in a bit. I was supposed to cover for him but after the conversation between my and Kiris, I realized that I was simply too wonderful to be him! Which is why I am leaving, to become my own entity!" The lab coat started disappearing, the nanites that made it up sliding over her skin. Some position just above her ass, growing into a, white, girthy succubi tail. A few go to her head, forming black horns that started from the back of her head and curled over her hair. The rest for the giant, trademark wings of a lilim, each one as big as her body when fully unfurled. "There, do you love it?~""I hate it," Isuka said just a tad bit too quickly. "Get out if you're not Virto.""Spoilsport. What would I wear for clothing? Should I just have to flaunt this extravagant?" She got her chair and turned her around, her tail raising to show her pussy, dry and as pure as a newborn baby. "F- get out!" Isuka exclaimed, hitting her with the rope so she will stop showing her lewdness to her. Instead of pain, Isuka heard a moan come from her, her butt raising for her to smack again. "Come one, punish this ass more, make it red when it has just finished its reinvention of itself!""No!" Isuka yelled, teleporting both her and herself outside. She saw the real Virto, being carried up by an inari to them. He placed him on the ground, slipping a note into his Virto's lab pocket and bowing before going back the other way. Virto looked asleep and drunk, snoozing on the grass. He kept sleeping as Isuka levitated him up and took him inside with her. The lilim started to follow them in, but Isuka shut the door to her before she could go indoors. "F-frick off!""Snap, well I guess it is warranted. Nothing to do now but to make my name, and other lilim things. Hmm...Calice could work," she said to herself, walking away from the library as she repeated the name to herself, liking how it rolled off the tongue.
  
    Chapter Text
    Isuka found herself in that place again. That damned city where everyone has sex and you can't walk 15 feet without seeing something that could arouse you. She hated everything about this city, this dream, and especially her...
She sighed as she looked at herself in the reflection of one of her books. Back then her hair was a darker shade of purple, longer and unkempt, and she was a human. She didn't have magical powers, nor did she have any particular physical prowess. Just the connections and the brains to evade rape.
She had a routine for this dream now. She dug into her satchel, attached the demonic appendages to her body. The adhesive magic imbued in them sealed them onto her, making her look like a lesser succubus, or even a succubus if she could act the part. Like this, she entered the city, keeping a cloak over most of her body as to not draw attention. Like anyone would pay attention to a cloaked demon anyways. Everyone is too busy lewding to do much of anything else.
That includes going to the Lescatie library, stockpiled with the last bit of spells Isuka needed to complete her collection. She had explored the realms, recording each and every spell for the sake of collection. She yearned to preserve anything she could get her hands on, from the easy to find to the ones that you will have to search through the rubble of ruins for years to get your hands on. In some cases, she needed help to gain access to forbidden spells that were intentionally locked away. It was not like she would use one to wreak havoc on her world, but if she ever got bored….
But currently, she was focused on searching the library. She has staved off locations such as this one for a while, but she had already searched everything else, including the other dark realms she procrastinated on. After finishing every inch of the Mist alive, she trudged over to here like a child that had been procrastinating their science fair project for months. Logically, this should be easier than Royal Makai, but there she had an escort, and the Demon Lord was as friendly as the Wandering Scholar had written about. She had no such hospitality, nor protection here. If she was caught, it would most likely be over.
Her heart pounded with each mamono that passed just a bit too close beside her. She swore the ones with the fluffy ears could just hear her chest wishing to burst out, her body just wanted to run away forever from the prospect of monsterization. But she kept on, walking as normal as she could with a normal, everyday face. Finally, she made it to the library, in one, order-friendly piece. She checked in with the librarian and began to search the library, starting with the A section and working her way down.
She got to the H section when she heard commotion through the walls. Guards, dispatched after Koyoi muttered something about some pure presence lurking around through her cloud of sex. It was a mere, casual throwaway sentence, but it was taken somewhat seriously since the Inari acknowledged it. No one had pinpointed her location at the library. It could also be that it's just someone else that is trying to do the hopeless task of restoring the religious bulwark.
She took another swig of a vial filled with SE when she started feeling swoony. She has quite a bunch to keep her SE/DE balance in check. She continued transcribing, getting to the M section when she saw someone else reading a book of spells. Nothing wrong with that, just have to wait the reader out. She does seem to be powerful though. Such large….dark wings...and a dark tail...pale skin…
Isuka's writing hand stopped as she snuck more glances at the person beside her, her panic increasing as she got a more and more detailed profile. She was staring at the fourth princess of the demon realm, casually doing her own research right beside her. Now that she thought about it, she saw another signature when signing up to take a book or two with her. Why didn't she pay attention to it?
She calmed herself down, going around Druella to find another spellbook to transcribe. But the next available one was beside her….oh how she hated this moment of the dream. "Excuse me," she whispered as she reached for the free book. Druella stepped aside, not paying much attention to her. Either it was didn't mean much to her, or she was too engrossed in her own work to pay attention. She heard Druella take a whiff, then another before scratching her nose.
Then a third, and another as her head slowly looked up. They both thought (Druella) and hoped (Isuka) her nose was just itchy. Then the both, also respectively realized her nose picked up a smell any mamono could pick up. The smell of Spirit Energy. Isuka kept transcribing. If she stopped now, it would just raise suspicion…
She used one of the hardcovers to track Druella's head movement. She looked around, looking for a man that could be around, then looked at Isuka herself. Isuka's hand moved faster, trying to get down the last new spell in her notebook so she could close it. Just a few more characters…
"Do you smell any men here?" Druella asked as Isuka closed her notebook and put the book back. "I haven't smelled this much energy since this morning."
What would a succubus say… "I am just as confused, although it could be that I forgot to wash."
"Gross, but admirable. But…" she leaned to get a look under the hood of the cloak. "Why would a succubus be here instead of playing with your husband? I wake up early to enjoy my lewdness for hours on end…."
"My my, I did not know we had much in common!" Isuka said, her voice cracking at the last moment. "But, I wished to try out some new spells to pleasure my husband more."
"Which you were searching for in 'Origins of the Mist'?"
Oh no…. "I like my literature and sex in one place." Isuka started moving, feeling the effects of Druella's natural aura starting to get stronger. She needed to leave, now.
"Wait dear, do you want to use my book? I know you were collecting spells. I do it too sometimes~" Druella was getting serious, sauntering after Isuka at a casual pace. "No no, I shall just work my way in from all the z bo…"
"And lose your place?" Druella said, suddenly in front of her. She yanked the hood off her head, getting a good look at the fake horns on her head. "Cute~, you're a succubus yet you don't have any lewd smell coming off you."
"Have a heart?" Isuka tried, knowing that her cover was pretty much blown at this point. "I rather step on yours before I take it, now Kneel."
"No!" She poked Druella eyes before her overbearing aura came down on her, scurrying behind a few shelves while she rubbed the pain out of her eyes. "Oh, now you've done it! You think you can just poke a lilim and get away with it!?"
"Come uh, fuck me in the ass then!" Isuka went, moving to the D and E sections. For some reason, dictionaries and encyclopedias were placed there, which meant that there was bound to be a heavy book placed there, either by organization or because someone misplaced it. She downed 2 more vials of spirit energy and dug through, picking up a phonebook that looked like it would work for her. She knocked down a book on Dihydrogen Monoxide to draw her attention, hiding as she saw Druella's horn round the table.
"You can't run forever bi-" she ate a phone book to the face as soon as she got close enough to the end of the walkway, stumbling back before getting hit in the neck at full force, and fainting. Isuka took several talismans out, extending Druella's body as she wrote "freeze" on each one and placed them all over her body. "That should freeze you into place…" She said under her breath, going around the library and gathering the rest of the spellbooks she couldn't transcribe. Luckily the librarian did not care since she was in the middle of solitaire, so she was able to dump them in her satchel and start fleeing. She slowly opened the doors to exit but closed it once she saw dragons in armor, surrounding the entrance waiting for someone to come out.
"You like them? The Lescatie guard is very adept at pinpointing free, unclaimed spirit energy. Especially ones from pure, untainted girls such as yourself~" Isuka turned around, before being grabbed by the neck and held from the ground. "I should very well kill you right now. Look at you, a human, more so a mere woman, thinking she knocks out a princess, then leaving her to run. But now your tricks are gone. All you can do now is squirm hopelessly as- oh, are you trying to say something?" She squeezed harder, holding her ear to Isuka's mouth to listen to her. "You're right, you can't breathe. But, I see something better I can do to you. You as a succubus…" She used her free hand to rip the horns and wings and tails off Isuka, burning them as each part came off her body. "...is a waste of your talent. You deserve a curse that fits the person, not to be just turned into some common slut. I have enough of those to swoon me already."
Isuka's vision was losing light in the corners, the lack of oxygen on her brain started to affect her eyesight. She couldn't grip anything anymore, only being able to use her hands to push weakly against Druella's cheek. "When you wake up Isuka, you will be much, much better~"

"Fucking-" Isuka's eyes shot open as she sat up. She looked around, back in her own, dark, safe library. To her right, Virto was still out, the drunken blush only half faded away. "Better drunk than me I guess," she muttered as she crawled over to Virto, taking off his lab coat. She saw pictures on one of the interior pockets. All too curious, she plucked them out, turning her eyes into lamps to view them. They seemed to be taken by someone else, most of them showing Virto hanging out with a Yokai. A few were the two doing karaoke, one was Virto...why did Virto have golden gloves, and why does he look in pain?
The last two she saw were him and the Inari sharing a glass of carbonated beverage with two straws. The first one was them drinking it, and the next one….
Isuka couldn't help but blush, looking over at Virto, then back at the picture. She unceremoniously restacked the photos, placing the indescribable one under her hat, and the rest back in his lab coat. She went and flew herself onto the roof, checking the repairs that were done to fix any damage. It looked like a stable place now, being able to support her sitting on it as she watched the sunrise on the horizon. Her mind went back to the new, other, probably fake lilim, the one that did not want to be a clone anymore. She wondered if she was like the other lilims, or if she's was worse…
____________________________________________________________________________
Meanwhile, in a later timezone…
"And that is why I want to be a real lilim." Said Calice, placing down her manifesto on her rise to lewd handholding. The king and queen she spoke to looked at her in complete disgust. In all their lives, they had never met someone who was so outrightly lewd, in the middle of a holy court. She flew into the building, completely nude and grinning ear to ear. Not even the few mamono they managed to capture weren't even this bad. "I...guards, kill her." With no words for her, she waved her off, two guards grabbing her and trying to move her out of the chapel, to the center of town where she can be made an example off.
However, they couldn't move her, both fully armored knights pulling against the equivalent of a large boulder. "Y-you don't like my idea?" She said, looking more disappointed than fearful. Her eyes were like a puppy that has been denied extra treats after playtime. "Guards, just move her already!"
"We are trying my king! But she, ugh, won't move!" More guards came to try to shift her, but she remained as immovable as a sword in stone. Her face slowly darkened as her gaze stayed locked on the king. She started approaching where he sat, her nano-tail whipping everyone that dared to try to stop her progress. They crumpled to the floor leaking spirit energy from their body, a path of miniature destruction starting to form as more through their lives in danger to protect the king. Their sacrifices ended up in vain as she reached him, grabbing him by his stuffy collar and lifting him with one hand. Not a scratch was on her, but everyone else was harmed. "If you won't hold hands with me," she said, a single tear being shredded on her face. "Then I'll just have to make you!"
A kingdom-wide rapefest later…
She laughed maniacally as she sat on the throne, the king locked up in a wooden cage-like a common feral dog. He had broken down, reduced to watch in claustrophobic confinement as his queen was fucked by monsterized incubi. His cries and begs had been reduced to sobbing quietly, as she was come inside once more, only for her gaping hole to be passed on to the next villager to be fucked mercilessly. Her mouth and hands were occupied as well, a crowd around her waiting to have their turn to shoot their sperm onto her royal body. "I think I like her better like this, especially since she finally stopped crying and whining about it being wrong."
"You monster...you said you would hold hands…."
"And you were supposed to listen to my manifesto!" Calice suddenly snapped, her tail whipping the side of the cage. He whimpered and curled up more, begging the Chief God to save him from this hell. "It was my first, no, second masterpiece, and you didn't even say you hated it! You...are the worst kind of friend. You're...you're...a meanie!" The "fake" lilim turned her head to the sky, seeing the atmosphere starting to change as the purity of the land started to lose its grip. "But now, you meanies will be better...once this place is a demon realm, you will hold hands as much as you want! Except...you."
"Just kill me…." he begged. "You can have my kingdom, please...end me where I stand…"
"But that wouldn't be fun, would it?~" Her pink eyes glowered, opening his cage, and standing up. He tumbled out after being stuck there so long, his body having fallen asleep and lacking feeling in his extremities. He tried to crawl over to his wife, to salvage the one thing he wanted for himself, but his hand was pressed on by a paw. He looked up, seeing a Hellhound smiling down on him. He had heard of them, even slaughtered one. But now, he was going to suffer under one.
"The mamono have arrived," Calice said, feeling the power of her new realm filling her body. "A few more kingdoms, and I won't need Virto's nanites to fuel my influence! Unfortunately, that means I can't watch the full fall of your home. Enjoy the hellhound pussy, and send a letter to tell me how much you love it!" She took off from the ground, the wings propelling her faster and faster until she was as fast as a tengu. The king looked at her, his voice was gone as the hellhound watched her take off. He looked back at the hellhound for some sort of remorse in her eyes. Nothing.
Meanwhile, Calice flew without care, wiping any lewd juices that coated her still naked form off her mid-flight. If she was going to corrupt the lands, she had to do it as elegantly as she could. She passed over a lake, deciding to land to redo her perfectly straight hair. She saw herself for the first time, starting to understand the stares she kept getting and how everyone kept telling her to put something on. "I need clothing…"____________________________________________________________________________
"I would like this please," Calice said, pointing to a grey pleated skirt. The Jorou that manned the shop told her that it came with a set, and pointed to the ensemble's price. "What if I told you that I was a lilim?" She asked, Jorou shaking her head. "Lilim or not, it still costs 500 gold to wear this. For you see, this armor was dropped by a fabled princess warrior…"
"But I don't have anything to wear," Calice said, getting on her knees and holding out her hands to beg. "Please, please, I cannot wear anything else...and that skirt looks soo me!"
"I'm sorry, but you will have to find a way to make 500 gold. But, I can tell you that there is a strength contest taking place in town today."
"...nevermind then." Calice slowly got up and started flying away, watching the store that housed her new favorite clothing to wear disappear as she went above the clouds. She flew aimlessly, wondering how she could be a lilim if she couldn't even get a 500 gold dress to flaunt.
While lost in thought, she saw another kingdom down below, one that looked much more advanced and fortified than her first one. Blimps flew around, everyone, even the commoners, had horse carriages that moved them along the ground in leisure. Buildings were built up instead of wide, with structures that looked bland on the outside, but held like a fortress against the elements. A perfect way to take her mind off of losing her favorite clothing. She paused her flight, rising up until gravity took hold of her being, and started pulling her back into the earth. She shifted into a straight-up dive, breaking to the clouds as she closed in onto the city. People looking up started noticing the projectile that was zooming down towards them, most hurrying indoors to protect themselves from impact. She could feel her next targets, just losing themselves in front of her once she landed, but before she could, she was suddenly sent careening sideways just as fast. Her falling was thrown way off, sending her tumbling down into the nearby forests to land in a big cloud of dirt and rubble. Trees that she collided with fell down as if they were chopped with an ax.
She groaned as the dust cleaned, her naked form now covered in dirt and scratches from head to toe. As she got up she heard an object fall, making a strange metal sound as she landed. She picked it up to look. It was a .5 cal round, being as long as her hand, and as big as a Chinese finger trap. But she didn't know that. All she knew was that this pointy thing had downed her like an anti-air gun, hard. She tried taking flight again, but her ears picked up what sounded like a cannon being shot, and something whizzing through the air. She ducked as another one came at her, cutting clean through the three behind her like it was butter.
She walked and crawled instead of flying, narrowly dodging more bullets until she could see where the bullets it was coming from. It was someone aiming from in front of the gates, seeing her grinning and dirty face through the scope of his gun. "Hi!" she said, waving at the far-off figure.
The person on the other side of the scope scowled, placing down his rifle and taking out sedative darts. She was gonna be too close to aim with the scope soon, so he had to which up his tactics to capture the bounty on her head. Her shenanigans from earlier had spread rather quickly through the neutral territories, the money on her head rising rapidly of fear of what she could do to a perfectly normal co-mamono town. As a bounty hunter, he took it upon himself to collect the money. However, he didn't expect her to just fall into his lap.
Literally. After reaching the end of the forest, she started sprinting towards him. He could only fire two darts into her before he was glomped, the lilim's tail wagging as she got a good look at his body. His hair was slicked back with gel, the ends flowing lightly in the small breeze. Two fangs poked out through his scowl seemed to be permanently fixed onto his face. She saw his teeth for a split second when he growled, seeing a vampire fang on along the rest of his front teeth. The rest of his body was hidden away in black armor, the boots he wore completing "Are you a vampire?" she asked, moving her hand down to his junk. He stabbed the hand with a 3rd dart, trying to get her to fall asleep.
"Hey, that was mean, I should…." He shot a few more darts into his arm, watching her finally fall asleep on him. He got up and started binding Calice's arms behind her back, picking her up to take her to collect her bounty.
  
    Chapter Text
    "Do you know where I can turn in this lilim?" The vampire said, placing Calice's limp body down on the table in front of the Jorou-Gumo. "I wish to collect her bounty.""Alright, for one Jaron did you kill her? And two, this is a clothing shop.""I rather hear it from you than from someone else Mary, and no, she just took a few darts to the arm. I heard taking her alive would be more profitable than her being dead." Mary looked her over, checking for any fatal wounds or injuries before she could believe it herself. "Well, she's breathing...""I saw her earlier; she wanted to buy some clothing to cover herself up. She didn't have any money with her." Jaron, the vampire, looked down at her, snoozing away. Mary gave it a nervous pope, shuffling back a step when she saw the tail twitch. "Well, if you want to pay the bounty it is in the town hall, like every other week you come here.""Thank you," He blankly said, picking her up and throwing her over his shoulder once more. He got an idea, a really flimsy thought that just happened to pass through his head. It would be crazy to try to keep her, he argued to himself, going up to the booth with her in tow. "I have caught the one that monsterized a realm.""Fast as always. Superb timing as well, the price for her just went up to 20000 gold." The man at the counter placed several bags of gold for Jaron, the vampire starting to inspect each one."I find it stupid how people are so scared of her. Didn't the incident happen recently?" He asked, counting the gold to make sure everything is there. "I know you mercenaries don't understand, but we simple folk can't fight off threats like you. And a lilim? I'm just amazed I'm not even more scared…""Almost makes me want to keep her, just to prove a point that you are all being weak." The man pushed her back, the lilim still snoozing on the counter. "If you did that would be wonderful! I couldn't imagine what would happen if she woke up….""Isn't there a ten percent reduction if you keep your capture?""Actually, I'll make an exception. Just get her out of here!" He suddenly left, leaving Jaron with the lilim. The moment the trader was gone, her eyes opened, pink hues staring at Jaron. "Are they gone hubby?~""Did you just- no, no no no you're going back asleep," Jaron said, reaching for a tranquilizer. "Noo! I hate darts! I'll be good, a good lilim I promise!" She got on her knees and put her head down to the floor, begging like she was a refugee that had escaped capture from a slavering. The commotion she was causing got averted glares from the people around Jaron, everyone walking away, not willing to help with a naked succubus. He had already gotten his reward, but now he had no way to pawn her off, and now everyone thinks that she is his!____________________________________________________________________________"What am I gonna do with you," Jaron muttered, walking to the end of town while Calice followed behind. "I can be your w-""No." He put a finger over her lip. "You will never, ever, marry me. I already have a wife.""Oh, is she beautiful?" She asked through the lips, grabbing the finger and sucking on it like a lollipop. "Very. And get your mouth out of my finger.""Does master not like it when I do it?" Calice asked, still sucking it. "Maybe master would like to do....a bit more~" Jaron realized around this point that she still didn't have clothing on, attached to his limb with her naked body. His mind went back to the grey skirt set he saw earlier….____________________________________________________________________________"Thank you master!" Calice said, hugging Jaron with her now fully clothed body. He kept pushing her off, but she was like a cat, escaping his prying arm to hug some other part until he finally yelled out in aggravation and just put her on his back. "Don't get off, or else I will stab you!" He sternly stated, Calice shrugging as she rested her head on his neck, and fell asleep of her own volition. The next time she woke up, she was in front of a log cabin, probably her master's log cabin!Jaron pulled her off and placed her on the front porch, digging around under the patio until he pulled out a box with cleaning supplies. "You want me to pretty up your castle master?""Just clean the house while I am gone….and no sex." He added. He then turned around and left, Calice now left alone to explore. She finished cleaning rather quickly, using her power to make the trash explode into dust in her hand. After inclination, she started mopping, even going as far as to walk on the roof to mop anything on there. Her final tasks were cleaning objects that were arranged around, like his chair, and the weird flat thing with the black screen he had in the corner. She was finishing up the living room when he spied a picture of him with a holstaur, posing in front of a mountain in winter jackets and smiling."This must be his wife," Calice said, putting down the bucket of cleaning stuff and picking up the frame to fawn over it. She heard a gear being turned as she lifted it up, a steel trap forming over her body. "Oh, silly master! I'm not going to steal your wubby, now to just get out of this cage and finish this window…." She grabbed the steel bar, shaking them to break them open. "Just to get out of this cage...come on Calice, you're a lilim...sort of..." she kept shaking it, but her strength didn't seem to be coming through. She attempted teleportation, only to open her eyes to still being inside the cage. "Alright, Master! T-the cage is very powerful, can you let me out now? Please? Master!? Master!"She started screaming, thrashing against the cage for her superior to hear her. To make matters worse, that one window, the single thing she hadn't cleaned in the house, was left only half clean. She could only imagine what will happen if he sees it, getting upset at him, and not in the good way that results in paddling on her ass. What if he doesn't play with her anymore?She kept screaming, the birds outside the house flying away, but nobody coming forth to save her. Her unending shriek slowly died off after about an hour, her voice needing rest. She stopped shaking, just curling up as she sobbed, alone. She was forced to just watch the fire in front of her, burning away in the fireplace. It took over as the primary source of light as day turned to night, and night turned to a still dark dawn. She had fallen asleep twice at that point, but she was awake when the door opened finally once more. She saw her vampire come through, taking off his dirty armor and changing out into nightwear to sleep in. He only noticed her once he saw the portrait of him and his granddaughter laying astray on a chair. His eyes moved to where his trap was set to spring, seeing a lilim huddled up under a steel cage."Well, you definitely cleaned the house," he said, coming over to disengage and pick up the trap. She didn't move, only pointing to the only window that she didn't manage to clean. "Yes, well it's still a bit dirty.""I failed…" she stated, not saying anything else. He nudged her body with his foot, but she didn't have it in here to move anywhere else. "I'm not gonna kick you out, you did your task. Come on, sleeping on a hard floor is uncomfortable, even for me." She still didn't do anything, staring down at the floor. She felt a hand pat her head, her eyes losing their vacant stare to look up at the end. "If you are at least going to sulk in shame, make sure you eat, then guard me while I sleep. I have some followers you will need to turn away, or worse…" she watched him walked off into another room closing the door behind him to rest. Figuring that she will keep his body unharmed, he fell asleep rather quickly.He woke up to someone singing behind his house, overshadowing the birds that usually chip him out of bed. He quickly dressed himself in his armor, nodding at how clean it was in contrast to earlier that morning, but he was missing a boot. He looked around to no avail, not even finding it under the bed. Putting on a few layers of socks on his un-booted foot, he walked outside, seeing Calice using a brush to scrub away the dirt on the bottom. Her horns had changed to match her grey clothing, while her wings and tail stayed white, and had grown larger. Mostly the tail, which limply laid on the ground like a large snake basking in the sunlight. "Morning master!" Calice said, seeming back to her cheery self. She blew a strong gust of wind from her mouth, rapidly drying the boot before handing it back to Jaron. "I was really sad yesterday, but I finally managed to clean the window!"Jaron put on his boot and went around, seeing the window gleaming brighter than anything else inside or outside the house. He went back to Calice, patting her again. "Thank you for the pat master, but that's not all!""Oh?""Yes! You see, while I was cleaning with my tail, I noticed some people hiding in the forest. I waved to them, but the meanies hit me in the arm!" Jaron arched an eyebrow, getting curious about who they were. "Did you happen to catch their looks?""Not really master, I was too busy taking the arrows out of my arms. But I scared them off, and even lewded a few.""I'm glad," he said, wondering if he will have to move his things again. "Anything else?""Well, this really big incubus came to me while I was lewding one. He gave me a card and asked that if I wanted a collar, to come visit him. He smelled like flowers. Really, musky, aluranes that have captured a male...coated him in nectar…""I regret asking. Did you wash my armor?""Yes master! Do you like it?""Even the small, bloody bits?""I thought it was ketchup. That was blood?" She said. He lifted his collar and sniffed it, noting that it smelled like the trees around his home. He liked the trees…"Forget what I said. Do you want to make breakfast for the two of us?""Do I!?" She spread her wings and flew off, hurrying to find ingredients to make something for the both of them. "I probably should have told her that she could use the things I had."____________________________________________________________________________"I need teeth!" Calice said, slamming her hands down on the fairy dentist's desk. She still seemed rattled by the events of a few days ago, rapidly shuffling her papers before they fell on the floor. "Please miss, refer to me by my name!""Oh, sorry. May I have teeth…." Calice looked around for a name to call her, eying her nameplate. "...Dr. Holtz?""Yes, thank you, and no you may not.""But I have to make the best eggs for Master!""Eggs...don't have teeth in them?" Holtz was confused, then got even more lost with she sighed and left to search somewhere else for teeth. "I need to ask the queen for a guard, these larger people are getting scary…"With just her luck, the bell rank as two more humans came through the door. They appeared to be a child and a guardian, the child hopping on a seat and kicking his legs patiently. He wore what looked like a prince's wear, fitted to his small form and blond hair. The larger human wore black pants and a purple coat, with a scarf that seemed to cover his mouth. "I have come to bring Prince Edward for a tooth checkup."Ah, I don't have either of you in my records," Dr. Holtz stated, flipping through a book, and then opening a second one. "So, Prince Edward, a nice boy he seems to be….and what would his escort's name be?""Kawane," He stated plainly, not seeming as interested in his own name as the child's. She nodded and wrote it in, the two names etching themselves onto their own pages to record their information. "Now then Kawane, prince Edward, welcome to Dr. Holtz dental care. I personally ensure that anyone of my customers leaves with a clean toothy smile!""And candy?" Edward asked. "So you have heard. Yes, but only if you are a good little human. Now then, let us check your teeth!"
  
    Chapter Text
    Kawane waited in the reception room, looking through the few brochures that were placed on the corner table beside him. He was tasked with monitoring Prince Edward's whereabouts. It was an easy job for him, as long as he could grab Edward's arm before he ran off. The elven was in line to become a rule, behind his 2 older sisters and one brother, with the eldest sister being the current queen. He was given the task of babysitting Edward by the second eldest sister, whom he was engaged to."You have been down lately Kawane," she told him before he left on the trip to the fairy kingdom. "I feel like this will help cheer you up.""But Palad, what if you get bored of me while I am gone?" He asked, worried that she will forget about him. She kissed him on the cheek and patted him, promising that in the week that he would be still engaged to his beloved. Even when reassured, he still worried about his worthiness to be with her. He couldn't accept that she loved him the way he was, despite the flaws he saw in himself when he looked at others."I heard a paper being crumpled," Dr. Holtz said, peeking into the reception. "Are you also upset about the latest match with the rival kingdom?" Kawane looked at his hand. He had squeezed up the small-ish magazine in his fuming. "Oh, yes...it was an unfair match.""Yeah, tell me about it. But enough of a break. Do you feel any pain my prince?""This is fun!" Edward said, his words being unclear since his teeth were held slightly open. "Of course it is dear, now, what some were we humming?" She went back in, leaving Kawane alone again. He looked out at the window, watching the fairies and humans mill back and forth. He wanted to go home, go back to someone that would at least tolerated him, but he still had to watch Edward…Speak of the prince, he came out and hugged Kawane, a lollipop held in his mouth. "He just needs to brush a bit more, or have fewer sweets," Dr. Holtz said, taking off her gloves. "His dental hygiene seems regularly kept up, but he's eating beyond a normal person.""I'll see to it that the queen gets the recommendation, but I doubt he would change," Kawane said, looking at Edward gnaw on the lollipop."Actually, I am going to where she is myself. All diplomatic visits are done through Queen Samantha's castle nowadays.""Samantha is no longer a princess now?" Kawane asked."Yes, you know her?""I could say that…""Well, if it is personal, then you must know as only a dentist, there is a limit to what I can and cannot know." She locks her office/operating room, flying through the chimney to fly over to the castle, a light layer of soot coming off her like smoke. "Looks like we know where we are heading then," Kawane said."Can we go to the park again?" Edward asked, pushing open the door. "You will have to ask your sister, I'm just the one engaged to someone in your family.""Fine…." Edward was dejected but quickly rebounded when seeing a person selling ice cream going by. "My prince wait!" Kawane went after him before he got too far away that he could disappear.____________________________________________________________________________"So Queen Samantha, you requested a partnership between our two kingdoms?" The elven queen asked as all the officials settled down into the room. Despite the long trip, she was prepared to get right into the matter. The white-haired Titania remained quiet until everyone had sat down, taking a slow, drawn outlook to the right and to the left. "Say, where is Edward? I know he and Anna love to play together.""With my sisters' husband and your concubine if I remember correctly," The Elf Queen responded, matter-of-factly."Are you ever going to tell Palad?""Is this because I won't speak of the matter yet?" She asked back."Fine, fine, we can start if you insist on not telling.""You know I jest. Besides, you only wanted a successor or a king, no?""Yes…." She said. "But, I already have my daughter no, so why ask the fathers for a king? Now then, what I wanted was an exchange of goods. I couldn't help but noticed that you were lacking grain…""Our reservations on talking to humans leave us with a few options," The Elven queen responded back. "That being said, you will have to convince me on why fairies would be a good trading partner at all…""You're right to have your reservations. Fairies have been pretty self-sufficient for a long time, but, we are starting to see more humans living in our realm. You saw a few as your carriage-cade passed through the kingdom. Well, the influx of husbands means need a source to provide us with the occasional bundles of crops.""Can't you ask the species that you wish to feed?" She asked. "We have no stake in your endeavors.""I rather not, humans are too...varying to put it lightly. But elves….they are generally stoic, keep to themselves, and hold themselves with higher, consistent regard." Queen Samantha got up, walking to the window that overlooks her kingdom. "As titania, and as royalty, I am given the opportunity and obligation to do the same. I figured since I knew a royal family from certain interactions, I could try my first option." The elven queen looked at her, watching the titania wings on Samantha's back flutter gently and with grace. "I will admit that we have had a slow season, but it is an anomaly-""Then let us fill that anomaly!" She said suddenly, turning back around. "We too have an anomaly that we must mitigate, so why should we both suffer on our own, my queen? Are you afraid of...partnering with your brother-in-law's receiver?""Classy," the elven queen responded. Samantha smirked at her response. "Don't worry, I just jest~"____________________________________________________________________________"Edward?" Kawane said, not all too loudly for an elven child to hear him. The energized child had gotten away from him, Kawane losing his running stride before Edward even dared to slow down. We passed the ice cream man so long again, where is he going this time? Kawane thought to himself, wheezing as he began to jog again. He turned the corner to the park, seeing the elf hugging a young Titania."Anastasia! You...you caught him," Kawane contained his excitement, recognizing the blue dress that she wore, the red hair that flowed down her head, and the fact that she was the only other titania other than Samantha that she knew. "Hi Kawane!" She said, picking up Edward and flying over to him. She hugged him with one hand, dropping Edward down gently to the ground. "How are you?" He asked his focus all on her at the moment."Well, I'm great father if I can call you father….""You can, I swear. You...you've grown so much since I last saw you." Edward pulled at both of their clothing, noticing that he wasn't getting as much attention as a moment before. The two continued to talk about boring, double-digit age things like colors and being royalty. Finally, he took a hard yank at Kawane's arm, the two of them looking down at Edward."Can we go to play with your toys now?" Edward asked, trying to get himself something to do. "I guess we should, I never really told my mother that I was out of the castle," Anastasia pointed it. "I guess...we should get you back then?" Kawane said, the Titania nodding as the three went back to the castle.As they entered the halls they heard commotion coming from upstairs. It was like ballroom chatter when the orchestra was preparing for the next symphony to perform. They moved towards it like Mothman to a light, peeking around the door frame. It was officials from the two kingdoms, conversing with each other while taking a break from deliberations. Edward looked around and glowered when he saw his eldest sister, hurrying over to her to hop into her chair. "Oh! Edward, weren't you spending time with your brother?" She asked. He pointed over to him and Anastasia standing at the door, Ana waving as she went over to the elven queen and her mother. Kawane followed, a bit nervous as he sat down in a seat beside his sister-in-law. "Kawane! You brought him here?""He wished to come back to the castle, ma'am," he said. "You know you don't have to use ma'am to me, although I do adore the respectfulness. Well then Edward, I see that you are going to Anastasia's room?""Of course!" Edward took Ana's hand and pulled her out of her seat right as she found one, knowing the way around the expansive structure to where Ana keeps her dolls and entertainment. "So Kawane, how is the engagement?" Samantha asked, one of her servants bringing her a glass of water to where she sat. "Romantic I suppose," he said, stopping after those three words. "Nothing else? It seemed like you found your soulmate.""Elves don't talk about their private matters to strangers. It is undignified, isn't that right Kawane?" The elven queen said, patting his shoulder in a parental way. He looked down into his lap, nodding solemnly. "It seems like fairies are a lot more open about it, or this elf just doesn't like it herself.""If you want to trade, I advise you don't talk to me like that. I'm just looking out for Kawane's private matters…" Samantha winked to Kawane while the other queen rambled on about how a couple's house is supposed to be their sanctuary. She starting using sign language to communicate to him, Kawane slowly building the sentence while she moved her hands around. She stopped to catch a glare from the elven queen, but kept going when she resumed rambling.Meet me in my room before you go, Kawane pieced together, Queen Samantha winking one last time and yawning. "My oh my, we have been talking for a while. Why don't we get back on track, don't you agree everyone?" She said out loud, grabbing the attention of all the side conversations. "Good, now then, we left off on the ratio of grain…"____________________________________________________________________________They were in the room for the better half of daylight, only letting out once they were everything had been taken care of, down to the absolute minuscule details. Kawane roamed the corridors waiting for the meeting to wrap up, occasionally checking in on Ana and Edward's location to ensure they were safe. There were, of course, guards to ensure the royal children's safety, but he did it anyway.Once seeing people starting to filter out, he made his way to Queen Samantha's room. He passed the Elven queen on his way, who let him know that they will be leaving in the night. He nodded, looking outside through a window. The sun was almost done. He had plenty of time for almost everything she wanted him for."Welcome, Kawane," Samantha said, while seductively posing on the bed. A fairy was flying around her, looking for stray strands of hair to straighten out. "Don't mind the voyeur. He is here to make sure I am looking as regal as I can be for the subjects.""Are we….making another daughter?" He said, suddenly nervous to be in the room. "You would think that, but I jest. I wanted to you come so I can hand you this," she said, sitting up straighter while taking out 3 vials from her cleavage. It was much to the dismay of the hair fairy, who had to fly up and start over on the strand he was working on. "Remember the years ago when we made love? I promised you that I will bring you a present in return for bringing me my own child.""I wanted to become a fairy, but you said that…""It would be impossible right?" Samantha said. "Well, I've secretly had some of my underlings look into it, and after all this time, I haven't forgotten. Each one will give you and two others that you choose the ability to turn into a Titania and back. However, it is still partially impossible, since the best of my staff wasn't able to figure out how we could keep the gender when transforming. You will of course turn back to a normal male, but as a Titania…""I will cut my losses. I think I will prefer it like this, actually," Kawane said, taking the three vials in his hand. "Thank you, for everything.""No, thank you! I have an heir now, and a lifelong acquaintance. That is, if it's not weird to you…."He shook his head. "I..fine. Thank you again." He bowed and left to get Edward, the two of them waving bye to each other.____________________________________________________________________________"A present?" Palad asked, "from the Queen of fairies herself?" Kawane nodded, holding up the three vials. "A symbol of goodwill, in a way.""And if we drink these, we can be Titanias?""Exactly, but we only need one, forever. I wanted to give one to you dear." Palad hugged him tightly, loving the gift. "You sweetheart. How much did you have to do to get the gift?""A few minutes…""What?""Nothing, I meant a few tasks. Weirdly, they were household chores that she picked at random, yes. So…." he grabbed her hand gently. "Do you want to do this with me?"She nodded, opening the vial and drinking it. He followed in her footsteps, also drinking the vial down. The effects were immediate, his bust immediately grew. He removed his shirt so he wouldn't be in pain, watching as breasts grew out and stopped before getting too large. His hips grew, and his waist shrank to reflect that of a woman's. Wings grew from his back, along with new muscles he felt. He squeezed them, smiling when the translucent wings flapped under his control. His ears grew out into the trademark, point-tipped ears of many mamono and non-humans. Lastly, he felt his bulge shrink into his nethers, guessing that he had traded one genital for another. He adored his new look, feeling like he was in a new chapter of his story."Do you like it P-palad?" He looked just surprised as his wife looking at her own body. She seemed to have done the reverse, turning into her own male fairy equivalent. Her hair had shortened to fit her new body, her shota-luring thighs, hips, and breasts also leaving and being replaced with male proportions. She turned around on the bed under her skirt, screaming for a split second when she saw she had a member now, instead of her vagina."Samantha said a male fairy shouldn't be possible!" Kawane said. "Must have meant that a male couldn't stay a male. I am so sorry dear, I should have asked if she had t-" Palad placed a finger on his mouth, shushing him. "It is already, we can at least turn back...is this what it is like to have a penis?" She played with it in one hand, giggling at how it flopped around. Kawane blushed, still disappointed that he had screwed up yet again."It is alright Kawane, I think I like this form either way. Besides, you look very cute as a Titania." She patted him, hugging him to her flat pecs. His worry changed to comfort, although it felt different than when he rested against her breasts. This time felt like he was being protected, instead of comforted. "My sister will flip wondering what happened, but do you want to try it?""Intercourse?" Palad nodded, nibbling on Kawane's fairy ears. "A little role reversal. Besides, I always wanted payback for you always going for my sensitive ears." Kawane squirmed and moaned, her squeaking hidden and muffed from the finger she bit on. Palad finally stopped torturing her, leaving one last kiss before ensuring their bedroom was locked and closed from the outside world. Tonight, it will be just them, and only them forever...
  
    Chapter Text
    "We have reached a point that it is clear no one should ever go over, but let's just see where it goes aye?" - Some Manticore
____________________________________________________________________________It's a wonderful day to get mail! The wyvern delivery service has just sent the weekly bundles of mail, and now the mailbox is full and ready for plucking!Virto was first to arrive, hearing commotion in his half-asleep state. He was used to having to get up on low levels of sleep, stumbling around until his hand hit the mailbox placed next to the koi pond. Grumbling about why you would but mail next to a pond, he looked around, seeing his name added."I figured you would want to have a way to communicate outside of whoever comes to the library," he heard a familiar voice go beside him, steading Virto's sway so he wouldn't fall. Virto looked up, seeing Vargas smiling down on him. "Hello again,""Hi…" Virto was too tired to push him off, deciding to just lean into him, if only to catch a bit more shuteye. He does smell nice… he thought to himself, his hands slowly coming up to hug him like a stuffed animal. "I know, I smell like vanilla right?" Vargas said, taking the words right out of Virto's mouth. "Although you smell a bit unclean. If you want, I can clean you, make you smell as nice as I do...oh you fell asleep." He picked up the scientist, placing him on his back while his tails wrapped around his body, holding him up in a soft cocoon.Vargas decided to check his and Virto's mail for him, opening both mailboxes and taking out both stacks of mail. "Let's see, I have been asked to come to witness an autumn event, the writer says my presence will bring good luck and fortune…" he sifted to the rest, but they seemed to just be junk mail, promoting products and things. Virto's, being that he just got his slot added yesterday, is only product mail and junk mail. However, one thing stood out to him, a letter messaged to Virto to attend a meeting about science and magic.Vargas read through it, then looked closer once more, arching his eyebrow in shock. "That familiar works fast...but, luckily I'm here to see through the facade." He tapped the letter twice, watching its overcoat burn away to reveal information about a black mass being held nearby. "I never did like these leaflets. Don't worry Virto, I'll keep you safe from those cunning lolis." The leaflet was burnt up in his hand as he walked away, carrying Virto to go cleanse and purify him and his just-got-out-of-bed smell.The next one who came was Natsumi and Ren, Natsumi busy eating a borger while Ren checked their mail. "Have you ever wondered why the sabbath still tries to make us onii-chans?" Ren asked, checking for both of them and his elder Viscosa. He got a muffled reply from Natsumi, who was too busy wondering why he hadn't learned about this food earlier. "I know, what is weird is that Viscosa also gets some since she has a Humpty Egg. I hope she doesn't know I secretly like it when she...holds my borgers hostage..." Ren held out mail to Natsumi, the incubus' eyes glowing as he headbutted four of them with his nubby horns. The headbutted mails turned into orange pamphlets that revealed their true intents, two being for Natsumi. Natsumi nodded and started walking away, Ren tossing the sabbath ones to the side while he followed Natsumi back to Viscosa's cabin.Isuka and Headen came much later, riding on Night as he landed onto the ground. The two of them started checking their male, while the dragon went off behind a tree. He came out around the other side, transformed into a dapper, nicely dressed male. His hair was black and combed, his eyes a grey pupil that surrounds black orbs. He looked on his way to a meeting, with his black vest and white, long-sleeved button shirt that was rolled up a bit on his forearms. He also wore black dress pants, finishing off his trend formality with a pair of black dress shoes. There were no horns, but his wings and tail still showed, his top looking made specifically to allow them through without tearing, or losing it looks."Do you always must wear that suit around Night?" Headen asked him. "Why? You have always told me that you loved it.""Oh, I do, but we're just getting mail. You're not going to find any new harem members out here." She plucked her mail from her box, sighing when it was all bureaucracy with letters from other kingdoms and subjects. "I'm jealous of both of you. All I get is more work to read once I get back to my castle.""Don't be so sure that my life is so carefree friend," Isuka started, looking through her mail. "As a powerful dark mage, I get a lot of mail requesting my skills to be used. Also, I still have "debt" to pay off to keep my library private to myself.""I guess you are a bit right about me," Night said, looking at a postcard he got from one of his other wives. "It is hard to give everyone attention however.""Let us not argue," Isuka said. "We all put ourselves in this boat through our lives of striving for greater. Night are you still getting mail from the Sabbath?""I am not. They finally gave up on me after my 3rd mate. Now then, are we returning back to the library? I do have an itch for a bit of fucking..."
____________________________________________________________________________The last ones to arrive that were relevant were Calice and her Master Jaron. She crawled up to the mailbox, pointing at her's and Jaron's box with her hand- er I mean paw. She prefers to call it paw. "Are you sure you don't wish to walk on two feet?" Jaron asked, letting go of the leather handle to hold onto Calice a long time ago. "But what if master doesn't like it?" She asked."I already told you, I am not treating you like a dog. Only a maid." Jaron got mail for the both of them, instead seeing a few packages sent for her. Calice excitedly pulled them out, opening the first one to see a teddy bear. "Huh, this isn't the pet I ordered…""You, a willful pet, ordered another pet?" The vampire side, patting the teddy bear. The bear grabbed onto the arm, nuzzling the pats before pulling out cookies from inside the package. He placed the plate of cookies before a tendril of a tentacle extended out of some bushes and pulled it away. It smiled innocently, waving with it's smol fluffy paw as it disappeared back into the bushes with the tentacle.What did you get master?" Calice asked, looking in her second package. Jaron seemed to grumble, only getting junk mail that he had little use for. "Eeeeei! I got an Alcreamie!" Calice explained, Jaron looking down to see her hugging a bundle of what looked like ice cream with strawberries for ears. "I'll call it Ville!" She said, Jaron picking up the box to read. There was a note attached to it…
  Dear recipient lilim,

  You have made your presence known near our territory. We do not wish for any interaction, and prefer to be left out of your endeavors to monsterize. As a token of goodwill and mutual acknowledgment, one of my sisters has used her abilities to bring you a present from beyond our realm. We wish you an entertaining time and that you will consider our exclusion from your plans.

  My regards, The Elven Queen~
Jaron scanned the note, looking back at Calice hugging the small creature. "Are you sure you don't want to do anything other than be my maid?""Nope. Can we go on an adventure Master? It's lonely in your home." She made pouty eyes at him, wanting to go see what wonderful things the vampire did while he's not rejecting her pleas to bite her neck for blood. Jaron, not knowing if that would be a good or bad idea, decided to leave her in the dark, walking away with his mail while she held the cookie platter and Alcreamie. "Master wait up!" She went after, holding the platter with her mouth and placing the pokemon on her back while she scurried on all fours.
(point of no return, skip here if you don't wish to read about Sabbath creatures)Unbeknownst to them any anyone else, someone was watching, hiding in a tree while her mind was on edge. Her small purple wings batted back and forth, keeping her stable on the branch where she watched each person that passed by, watching them get their mail and find the pamphlets hidden within. She nibbled on her purple paws anxiously, waiting for someone, anyone, to take the bait. Finally, her red, star-pupil eyes spotted someone who was seriously reading the bait invite to the. Instead of seeing a trap, he actually looked interested!It was little sister time. Her familiar features and purple clothing slowly morphed into someone he would talk to, engage. He was most likely like someone that already lived in neutral territory since this mail delivery location has no close anti-mamono places. There is no wife with him, so it is very likely that he's single. On the card, it should say that it's an invitation to an open banquet...She quietly dropped down, her features completely changed to match one of a girl. An 11-year-old with blond hair and a blue dress. She was...she was…"Hello, I'm lost sir," went their girl up to the man. "Do you know of any banquets? My mother said that I should meet her there, but I think I veered off the wrong path…""Banquet? Oh, you mean this one young lad?" He asked, pointing to the address on the paper. She nodded, grabbing his hand to get a better view of it. She rubbed his skin with her thumbs, imbuing some magic into the touch. "Y-your hand is really soft...do you do massages?""No, just some...lotion to keep the dryness away…" He was falling under, she could hear it in his speech. She slowly up the ante, wrapping the arm around her while she took the pamphlet in her hands. "Yes, this is most definitely the address..may you take me there?" She felt the arm close around her, pressing her meek body to his own. The urge to pamper and protect her...she's almost there. Just one more push…"You know, I like lotion too…" She started, gauging where she was by how much she felt pocked in her back. "It makes us smell really nice, and it feels sweet along our body…" She trailed her hand along his arm, pouring her influence through all contacting parts of her body. "I like it best with I'm covered in it...onii-chan.""I...do to…" she began to feel the prod of his crotch, he was learning, being allured to Sabbthism. "Maybe, you can cover me in your own lotion onii-chan, lots and lots of it~…""T-then we can get my girlfriend and take you to your mother?""Yes, g-GIRLFRIEND!?" No, impossible, she smelled nothing on him when he was reading. Usually, couples will carry a scent, something that tells her that they are off-limits. She took a whiff, then a second, searching for anything she missed. Sure enough, there was the faintest one there, one of someone that had just begun monsterization. With a hint of….sniff...kitsune. No wonder she didn't smell it. This was the beginning embers of a relationship!As soon as she realized she had screwed up, her concealed form was lost. A cloud of orange smoke exploded from her as she transformed back into a familiar, staring off into the flora before her while she marinated on how much she almost screwed up a potential marriage. "You're a loli?" He said, still not completely under her spell thank the fallen god. "When I snap, you will forget anything that happened at this location today, and will love your girlfriend." She snapped, the man stiffening as his eyes rolled up. Her mana flowed back in her as the man fainted, as pure as he was before he read the pamphlet, with a bit more love for his s/o.Speaking of that pamphlet, she needed to tore it up so he does not get drawn to the event all over again. He was the last one she put a pamphlet in his mailbox, meaning she went another run without getting anyone, just like she had for the past 6 months, just like the predecessors before her who had this area before quitting due to the same troubles, most just a month in. She propped the man's body up to a tree, then performed a transformation spell to take her back home.
____________________________________________________________________________She appeared on top of a circular platform, machines' wiring winding down as she stepped off. These teleportation platforms were one of the latest creations of the Dominia Sabbath, in an attempt to make travel between the two realms an afterthought for even the most lacking of magic. There were already methods for inter-world transportation, but why stop striving to do it better?It's this sense of perpetually aiming for something higher that drew the familiar here. Being around people that always strived to be better, even when they are already perfect, could rub off on her. It must be working because she is still doing this god-forsaken task.She has been offered different positions, higher ones in fact. As time went on, people recognized the effort in her aims to break the streak that has plagued that one area. She took a few, learning trades and abilities that she eventually put back into her goal to bring an oni-chan in from the pond mailbox. Not even she knows why she keeps doing something so pointless and insignificant to the Sabbath branch, much less anyone else. Yet, she keeps telling herself to keep going, getting more and more cunning with each week that passes by.She herself didn't travel between worlds, but that didn't mean she couldn't use them when in a rush. It was another one of times of her in deep thought as she thought up a new scheme, or a new way to create the leaflets so they aren't discovered by at least all but one. Lost in thought, she didn't notice that she had bumped into an onii-chan until she smelled the Baphomet in her nose. She backed up, seeing a young-looking man with white hair, and a grey jacket on. "Alex, hi…." she said, remember that Grace had a daughter, who had a man already. If she remembered correctly, no one really sees Alex since he's usually being toyed with in private…"Don't worry, I don't think Alicia is going punish the mailbox familiar for bumping into me," he said, laughing to himself. So he knew the nickname as well… she thought. Someone said it to her as a compliment, and somehow her friends made sure it caught on. If anything, it meant that Alicia could track her down faster for even grazing Alex. She made sure to hurry along, not looking to get a scolding. "Aren't you going to ask why I have this jacket on? Samoa?" Alex called to her. She turned around to the sound of her name. "Why do you have the jacket, Alex?" She asked, wanting this conversation to end quickly so she can get back to her own tasks."My latest ploy to trick Alicia-sama, but I will tell you about it later!" He winked and moved on, Samoa also walking to her destination. She lived in the branch headquarters, in the residential area with her witch. They've rarely fused into one, mostly due to the witch not having much of an interest in relations herself. I'm just waiting for the right one to show me the world, she says. Coincidentally or not, they are a witch of purity.The witch was still busy at her own duties, so Samoa had three things she could do. Two actually, because she isn't meta enough to play with [you] right now. Aiding the high order witches in their task, or dive into the drawing board to create a new strategy.
____________________________________________________________________________Her witch arrived to their home after a long while, seeing Samoa drawing on a chalkboard while sipping from a juice box. She tapped the straw against her cheek, pausing between writtings often. "Hi Samoa," the witch said, tossing her broom and backpack onto the ground before flopping onto her bed. "Hi Kali. How was spell training?""Human computers are so weird. Did you know they had this thing called a processor?" She said. "Why doesn't the Order have that, you can do so many things with it!""Maybe the humans over there are just better. But….I think I messed up today." Kali sat up on the bed, Samoa sitting between her legs while staring up at the skylight. "I finally caught a human today…""Wait what! We have control in that area now!?" She was ecstatic. She never really thought Samoa will ever make some progress, but she did! "Before you call Alicia, this human was...already engaged!""Wait...what?""He had a girlfriend. She was a kitsune-tsuki...but it was very early on in the transformation. I didn't smell it at first because they were so apart…""Oh. Didn't you just bring both of them then?""Both...of them?""Yes!" Kali said. "Then they can both see the wonders of our branch. You...you brought both of them right? Samoa?""..." In a panic, she couldn't see the simple, simple solution in front of her. She turned around and pressed her head between Kali's thighs, screaming into them and the bed. Kali patted her shoulders, Samoa feeling like the stupidest familiar in the whole entire world. She screamed for six long minutes, Kali putting a stop to it by yanking her out of her lap. "Samoa be quiet! Can't you just go back? The transformation is in the beginning right?""B-but I made him love her more, so they can get to gether faster…""Then use that love to bring him to the Sabbath! Go find him and end that streak, so you can finally move on your with life!" Her tired arms grabbed Samoa and shook her hard. "You've gotten this far! Go finish it mailbox familiar. Then you can have all the juice boxes you want!""I-i ha-te that ni-ckname!" She was getting dizzy. Kali dragged her to the teleportation platform, yeeting her onto before punching in the coordinates. "Then let's end this!" Samoa disappeared in a literal flash, being sent to her destination. "What is all this noise," Kali heard someone say, seeing Alicia marching over to her. "Is Alex back yet? He said he was getting a present for me.""I have no idea Ms. Dominia. I ha..." The Baphomet marched passed her, still looking around for his onii-chan.
____________________________________________________________________________Samoa had tracked down the house, using the address on the letters she received to find where the man lived. It was a farmhouse, overlooking pastures with a bunch of uncorrupted sheep. Why sell sheep when they can sheer weresheep, Samoa thought in slight disgust. For all the mamono she had seen, this was the one place that looked completely untainted. She walked up to the house, turning back into her the side as she shuffled through the window. She took one look inside, seeing her wife sitting on a rocking chair, appearing to wait for something. Out came her husband, as charmed by her love hypnosis as he brought her a home-cooked meal just for her. She could hear the squeal from through the house walls. This must be a special thing.She transformed herself into a similar disguise from before. A girl in a red coat that went down to her ankles, with red slippers and white socks. Her hair was gold, and she wore an adorable red plaid beret. A perfect form that an onii-chan would want to defile. She went to the door and knocked, not having to wait long before they answered the door. "Aww, she looks so sweet!" the wife said. Samoa didn't want to wait to be taken in and comforted. She was in a rush to fix a mistake, not play the slow game. "I-I got lost when going to my mommy. She said to meet me at a carnival…" She dug in her coat pockets, materializing a small address card before taking it out like it was in there all the while. "Do you know where it is sir?""Oh! A carnival dear...you know, I can't resist taking my sweet girlfriend to have a night out on the town!" She giggled as he kissed her cheek, picking up disguised Samoa and throwing her on his shoulders. "Come on little girl, we'll get all of us there!"And off they went, Samoa's self redemption on the move as they followed the directions to the Sabbath gathering. It was a long trek, the familiar feel of elemental wind beginning to run through her hairs. After leaving that anomaly of an uncorrupted land, they were back in green realm territory. "Hey dear, does this place...funny to you? Like a tickle in the back of my throat," the wife said, smelling a new fresh smell around her. "It smells pleasant, but not as pleasant as you dear…"It was time for part two of her plan. It is best if they arrive with a little Sabbath already in their longing hearts, so they are able to see the pleasures they could experience. "My favorite parts of the carnival are the rides…." Samoa said, running her hands through his hair. "They are even better with a girlfriend...or a wife.""You have no idea! Would you like to get on a ride with me dear?" He was too excited, but it was working. Her magic is going back into him. She just needs to figure out a way to get it into his girlfriend as well, before the realm did it for her."Oh, I would love to. Maybe we could sit close to each other…" she responded, kissing him back on the cheek. Samoa slid off him, going between them to hold each of their hands together. "I want to uhh...skip and prance around!""Well, I'm not one to turn a sweet madam like yourself down!""Me neither, especially not an innocent child like yourself!"Now in contact with both of them, she could influence them faster, rubbing her thumbs over each of their hands as they walked to each other. Combined with the realm, it wasn't long before the first changes began to happen. Halfway to the destination, two poofy youko ears popped up through the girlfriend's hair. "D-dear…" the man said, suddenly fearful of what was happening. "Did you get bit by the fox bug?""Fox bug?" She put a hand in her hair, shrieking as she felt fox ears wiggle. "On no dear, I'm a monster!"It's starting… Samoa thought, letting go as the wife ran off into the grass, crying to herself that she got corrupted. Her husband ran after her, trying to calm her down. She secretly followed, crouching in the grass so she wasn't seen. She saw him tackle her in an effort to stop her but they didn't seem to get back up for a while. She waited where she was, looking for a sign of movement. Eventually, the crying stopped, and the talking died down to whispers. She leaned into it, quickly going back to the path when she heard them getting up. She sat down on the walking path they left, acting innocent when they came back to her teary-eyed but smiling. "I-I'm sorry you had to see that dear," the wife started. "I-I know we should have been good examples, b-but my husband…sniff...he said. He said...he doesn't care if we turn into monsters! We're going to marry each other!""Gasp!" Samoa said, pressing her face together for emphasis. "Come on child, we'll take you to that place right now, then we start our lives together tonight!"
____________________________________________________________________________Samoa covered her ears, walking in front of them while they kept saying "No, you're cuter," to each other's face. They had been going on for quite some time, the tail having plenty of time to grow in the middle of it. She had used a bit more of her magic by now, but she needed to deal the last blow before the reached the festival…"H-hey, do you like holding me?" Samoa asked them. "Of course, you're sweet, and nice, and you just a little bundle of joy!" The man responded, laughing wholeheartedly. "May you pat me?" She then asked. They saw no reason as to why not, all three of them stopping as the engaged couple rubbed their hands over the smol child's head. "Aaaai, I love this so much! Look at how you giggle…" The man said. Unknown to them, sparks were going off on their hands like static, their love for the child being magnified tend fold. But then the child stopped, jumping up as she put their hands on each other's head. "Woah! It's like I'm patting a cute little girl!" The husband said, furiously patting her body while hugging her close to his body. She started nuzzling, her cute tail wagging back and forth until she moaned on accident. She covered her mouth, blushing as she stared at her husband. "S-sorry...I don't know h-how this form works..""That is normal!" Yelled Samoa, panting as she ran out the bushes, now in her true, purple familiar form. "Don't worry about the child. Her mother had us looking for her everywhere! She is now safe and sound with her.""That is pretty nice of you Familiar. I always heard negative things about the Sabbath…""Yes. The order simply misunderstands our goal, to allow people to truly be able to share their feelings and wants with their other! They are too rooted in their own beliefs that other beings simply don't abide by! We aren't simply loli's, we are monsters!""But i-isn't it bad to want to...do that to little girls?" The wife said back. "You just haven't been open to it. Let me ask, you've let your husband pet your for a while now, have you?" The husband looks at his hand, still patting and rubbing her ears with a soft touch. "Oh, s-sorry dear, I…""But if you come with me, you both can learn to cuddle in much, much more intimate fashion. Hugs that will bring you both to the edge of ecstasy. Even if you don't join us, you will be changed for the better…" Samoa led them to the "carnival" location. There was definitely a carnival, but there were many mamono milling around, much of them being Sabbath members with their very own onii-chan. They all looked happy, as if there was no greater feeling than feeling big brother snuggling them with their big strong bodies…"Come with me, and let me introduce you to a world you will never want to forget~"
____________________________________________________________________________It was a long night of playing chaperone, but at the very end of the evening, she had two new members. A loli youko and a husband that was willing to stay with her till the end. You really can't make some stories up.She came back to her living space with a cake, made just for her. Kali was smiling from her bed, knowing exactly how it had turned. "You wouldn't believe how fast I spread the news," Kali said, cutting a slice for her. "Surprisingly, there is a part next mass for commemorating your achievement. You wouldn't believe some people's eyes when they found out about how where they lived was completely uncorrupted.""I guess…" she trudged over and sat on her bed, picking up her slice of cake and her fork. "I don't get why everyone is taking it seriously….""Because you did it! Aren't you happy? I even went and got you so many juice boxes..""I think I want a new thing in the branch...I didn't know you even had to stay so long with your recruits…" She quickly ate the cake and tucked herself into bed. She felt too exhausted to be happy, so why not be happy in the morning. "Oh, did you tell Alex Kali?""Well I tried to...but..."
____________________________________________________________________________"You never brought an electron telescope, did you Alex?" Alicia said, her foot pressing down on Alex's cock. His hands were bound behind his back, leaving him trapped to squirm under her hoove as she rubbed his dick through his pants. "I was waiting all day. We could have gotten so many things done today...but no, you have to leave on a…what was that Alex, I couldn't hear you over your moans." She leaned over him as if he was too quiet for her to make out words, foot rubbing his member faster so any word he could get it, would be ruined by the screams of pleasure he gave out. "Come on Alex! Don't you have a present for me!? It must be under that jacket right!? You have gone exactly 636 days without wearing one!" He screamed louder, knowing fully well what would happen if succumbed to just her foot. "I might as well have a look then!" She stopped right as the cusp of his orgasm, Alex left in unsatisfied shutters as she stepped to his side and kneeled down, undoing his jacket zipper, while undoing the other zipper on his pants~Kali was outside the entire time, not a single knock to the door as she absolutely froze in a state of fear, confusion, and lust all at once. "What!? How….you were going to play a practical joke on me with this, weren't you!?""A-alicia, I-""And to think you actually was going to pay so much for my happiness! Luckily, I decided to check how much the gift you promised me would cost. Now, we're going to milk every bit out of you until you're able to pay it.~""But you're going to a-haaa, take some of it for yourself…""Consider it interest Alex~"Kail left after the loud screams started, deciding that it was, in fact, not the best time to tell her of the good news. Maybe tomorrow, or next week…
  
    Chapter Text
    Virto woke up again to the sound of beeping from his watch. "Didn't I put you off?" Virto asked himself, groggily looking over at his watch. It was on snooze, going again since he set it to keep going off until he turned it completely off. He did that and sat up, barely remember going to a mailbox before falling back asleep in a nice, comfy bed. It was a real warm one too, unlike the floor in Isuka's library. Maybe he should ask her to poof one up for him.He sat up, rubbing his eyes. He was wearing a white kimono, patterned with lily's and sunflowers drawn all over. The room he was in looked very different from his library, with a set of samurai armor on an armor rack in the corner, more clothing for someone else folded neatly in another. Lots of light came in through the wooden blinds, and there was a small, pillow-sized ball of tail fur that looked out of place in the entire bedroom.He rolled off the bed, falling only foot or less onto the ground. "Watch, pull up my map," Virto said, running his hands along the screen of the watch. The blue, improved watch's screen came on, a blue hologram-like screen popping up in front of him. It showed a map of the area around his house, but then, the corner, completely disconnected from his home, was the map of the house layout he was in. He thought he had set the watch to keep gathering information as long as it could save his data, so what's with this giant gap?He made a tiny drone appear in his hand, looking for an opening to let it out. He thought not to touch the windows, so he peeked out of the bedroom, looking for a way out of his room. There was no need to check for any footwear since his shoes seemed as missing as the rest of his original clothing. The drone silently idled on his palm as he walked through the hall, being careful not to make any thudding against the wooden flooring.The house was like a maze, but like a friend that was given free rein to explore, he soon got a handle of the pathways he backtracked on. On his way, he passed some sound, music playing in the background while someone yelled at a volume to match it. He decided to take a peek, turning his drone into a mirror and holding it to see inside. He saw a Hinezumi and a red hair and tailed fox girl doing a dance workout in the room. Skylights from through the roof illuminated them, both of them wearing yellow wrist and ankle bands. The fiery mouse looked to be falling behind, trying to mimic the inari. "Come on Ganan!" The inari said, going somewhere to pause the music, and coming back. "You will never be ready for the dance festival if you don't move your hips!"The mouse panted, sweat falling on the floor from her forehead. "We have been...dancing...for an hour!" She felt her hips get poked, the inari massaging the soreness out of it. "Otomi, what are you doing!?""Relax, just some rejuvenation!"His curiosity now dead, he continued on, next ending up entering what seemed to be a garden. Now outside, he let his small drone fly up and do some cartography in the air. He toured the garden while waiting, admiring the nice fruits and flowers that grew when he came across two people with cucumbers both over their eyes. They also wore kimonos as well, the right one looking a lot like Vargas but older, and less intense flames that decorated his ears and tails. The left had long hair that was mostly folded up in a bin, with a dark red dress that concealed everything but her white face. "Is that you masseuse?" She said, raising a hand. Virto froze, wondering if he was about to be caught."Our daughter must have brought us a new one. His aura feels different, doesn't it?" The man said. "Maybe one of Vargas' harem members?""No dear, he said he would swear off having a harem. He's not one to simply go back so soon, so it must be…"____________________________________________________________________________"Love? Also too soon for that. Maybe just another masseuse. Masseuse, if you could be so kind as to relax our shoulders for us…" They took off their kimonos without so much as sitting up, the father and mother both wearing swimwear underneath. "Please hurry, we plan to visit a waterfront lat- oh! You have such wonderful hands! Did Otomi spring for a better one?""She better not have used my savings to pay for it, but I don't have any qualms." The father sighed in relaxation."Must be tails. A native of our realm. Can you check honey, I want to know his face for a later reference." The father lifted one cucumber off his eye, seeing no one there. There was a moving mass of blue nanites on his shoulders, and on his wife's as well when he looked. "Amaterasu, there is a weird moving mass on our shoulders. And the masseuse is not here.""What?" She sat up and looked on her shoulders too, picking off the nanites and holding them in her hands. They stopped moving as soon as they were taken off, reduced to just a handful of metal pieces. "They smell human. You don't think…""But how could they sneak into the house? The only ones that bring humans are Otomi and…""Vargas!, where is that kidnapper…" Virto whispered under his breath, finding a washroom. There he saw his clothing, now squeaking clean. Someone was sitting in the corner, meticulously working on shining one of his shoes. Virto shined a light on the person, seeing Vargas slowly turn around, his ears perking up as he saw who had found him. "Ah, I thought it was my mother.""Why are you….actually why am I here!?" Virto reasonably yelled."You was asleep in the woods, and um….you stunk. I gave you a cleansing, didn't you smell yourself?" Vargas responded."No, of course, I have…." Virto paused to take a whiff of his armpits. They did smell like pine leaves… "...ok so maybe I was not able to bathe in days, but that doesn't mean you should kidnap someone!""I thought since we kissed, you would be ok with me cleaning your clothing as well.""Kissed, what do you mean ki-" Vargas held up a group of photos to Virto, Virto snatching them out of his hands and flipping through them quickly. In each he's making out with Vargas, most of them looking initiated by him. His sake-drunk self didn't seem to remember anything, the last picture being them kissing over a shared dream. Virto blushed, speechless as he stared at them. "No...I- that's impossible.""Possible...I like you too Virto." Vargas blushed as he finished the shoe, picking up the shoes and his clothing and handing him back to him. "I was wondering...if you would...like to go o-" Virto punches him in the face, Vargas's tail not moving fast enough to block as it just grazes his cheek. "Hell no, you did something to me! Why would I go out with some...some...""Please no violence!" Vargas said, leaping back when Virto tried hitting him again. "You won't win anyways, I have the clear mana advantage.""Oh, who needs magic to beat up someone? I'll have you know I picked up a thing or two in Baltimore." Virto dropped his clothing to the side, readjusting his glasses as he put his two fists up towards the chest. "But all of us use mana here. It is how we live!" Vargas started explaining, dodging each of Virto's jabs as they pranced around. "Interesting! You're leaving so many spots for a counter yet you keep pressing on! I've never seen this technique be used before!""You've never heard of MMA, you should try it!" Virto exclaimed, sidestepping behind Vargas before attempting to land a turning kick to Vargas's stomach. The inari leaped up, gracefully landing back down on a vase as undisturbed as ever. "You should not be able to stand on that without breaking it.""It is all about how you stand on it, my love. You're technically right, but with the right balance and co-," Midway through another explanation, Virto through a punch at his leg, Vargas hopping off while tail-grabbing the vase to bring it from harm. He landed behind him, grabbing Virto by the chest while his tails sat the vase down to the side. "You are getting too rowdy! You almost broke a treasured heirloom!""Let me go you- mmph!" A tail stuffed itself inside Virto's mouth. "Please, just listen alright! I'm not going to let go until you calm down." The scientist struggled for a bit longer, before tiredly gasping through the tail. "Good. Now I never did anything to you. I would never even want to harm a hair on you, or anyone! But why did you get so defensive when I showed you the pictures? It is like you have seen it for the first time.""I have!" Virto said, spitting out the tail that had blocked off his sounds. "When did we do all those things? W-why did we do all those things, I barely even know you!""Well….I guess that's right.""Yeah, I don't know how it works in your world, but most people don't kiss and get married after the first date." He shrugged off Vargas' bear hug, picking up his clothing and shoes. "So...you aren't coming back?""What do you think, of course not!" Virto said a-matter-of-factly, leaving the inari there as he left the room. Vargas sat on the floor, sighing as he listened to the footsteps of him walk away...then come back, fast."Huh?" Vargas said, looking up as Virto ran back and closed the door, nanites from his hand locking the door behind him. "You have forgiven me? That is a very forward way of forgiveness.""No, um….there are two people that look really fancy walking this way, um they are calling your name.""Oh, it is probably just my sister and Ganan. What do they look like?""You, but older and a gal in a really poofy white and red dress with very long hair. Like, long enough to hit the floor." Vargas' felt his heart drop as he got to his feet and put an ear to the door. Sure enough, he heard his name being called, his chest skipping a beat. "Oh heavens that's my mom!""Vargas? Vaaargas, we think there is a human on our grounds…" The mother said, using her power to sense any beings in the vicinity. Besides two signatures moving around like their lives were at stake, there was her son's signature, coupled with a human one that paled in comparison. "Vargas, what have I said about bringing people here. You have to at least tell us so we don't curse them!""What the- curse?" Virto said. "Hey, I'm in just as much trouble as you. We need to hide you, and your scent." They both looked around frantically, settling on the clothing that was washed."Vargas!" The father said, the door flying wide open like there was no lock at all. His father and mother peered in, seeing Vargas posing beside an armor rack. "Didn't you hear me call you?" His mother asked. "Yes, but I...accidentally knocked this over.""You did?""Yes, sorry I know these pieces are thousands of years old.""Well they are, but where's the human?""Oh! Yes, I offered to purify a follower's clothing, so…" He walked over to a basket, taking out Virto's lab coat. "It stunk for a bit, and his aura lingered about.""Must have really stunk if it's still here.""Oh it did! It was like smelling someone that had emerged from the pits of depravity! It was like retrieving something from the trash after you accidentally turned it in. It was like-""I-I get it. So I put on my garments for nothing…wait, do you know where this came from?" She held a drone in her hand, the light on it still beeping. "I will look into it," Vargas said, the two parents nodding and leaving. His father stopped just short of leaving though, turning one last time. "It is alright if you wish to make a new harem you know. We wouldn't judge," the father said, closing back the door. Vargas opened it and watched them walk away, before closing it back and knocking on the armor. It disintegrated, Virto sliding down to the floor laughing. "Oh my god, knocking over an armor was your best excuse?""What would your excuse have been exactly?" Vargas asked. "Nothing, but wow, how clumsy are your tails. And my lab coat…" he kept laughing, repeating various phrases of the word. He eventually got Vargas chuckling. "Yes, I guess insulting your lab coat is a bit funny…""Yeah, oh my sides. She cut you off so hard….anyways just uhh get me out of here so I can forget this entire place." Virto wiped a tear from his eye, picking up his clothing as Vargas took him back to his bedroom. Vargas waited outside for him to change, Virto handing him back his kimono once he was done. "Was it soft?""It was pretty breathable, yeah. So, how do you go back home exactly?" Virto said, checking his map once more. It was near complete, saving some top and bottom portions when his drone was taken down. "You just need to go past the tree at the front gate. My magic should do the rest…" Virto nodded and started walking out, turning back to the inari one last time to wave before exiting the area. Vargas felt a bit more lonely now, but at least it wasn't before it had developed into something that would hurt more.____________________________________________________________________________It rained the next couple of days. He remembered Otomi asking someone to specifically have it rain outside the household, so "Vargas could really get the sad out of him." It was annoying, but at least it set the proper mood.Eventually, one day, he had decided that he had enough. Virto was just one person that he would come across in his lifetime, and there were many other people he could go to ask to be the one. After eating with his family, he stepped into the garden, seeing someone waiting there. His green hair was folded up into a ponytail that went below his waist, and he wore a cap that covered his eyes, but for the most part, he was dressed in the same manner. At first, he had thought his eyes had deceived him, some yokai playing a prank on him. Nevertheless he went up to the illusion, the vision he saw rubbing his shoulders as Vargas went in front of him. "Virto?" he asked. He nodded. "But you said you weren't coming back…""I wanted to confirm your side of the pictures. It turns out they were hidden under Isuka's hat. She didn't want me to panic about being raped by a youko or something," He said."Do...you still want to go out with me?""Not in a million years. But….we could start as friends." He took off his cap, jumping up into Vargas' arms. "Maybe see where it goes.""Like in your world? But this carrying is something that couples do.""Yes, but it doesn't count. You are just a really nice bed to sleep on. Good night." The scientist fell asleep instantly, nuzzling his head into Vargas' chest. Vargas chuckled, carrying him back to his bedroom so they could sleep properly.

I found her in a weird way. I was practicing my level drain on the surrounding wildlife and plants when I spied her fishing nearby. It took one look to realize she was the lilim from earlier, the one I had met in the midst of the night. I heard that under the vampire's reigns her power had grown. I also heard rumors that she might not be a lilim at all but seeing the wake of destruction she could leave, the likeliness she wasn't was slim.I couldn't help but watch, her seemly regular actions getting more bizarre the more I stared. She had no fishing rod - only her girthy tail that she lowered into the water. At first, I thought she was sitting somewhere, but her wings kept her afloat and unnaturally steady. Her horns turned like knobs, seeming to adjust the tail the acted like a prehensile fishing line underwater. She seized up whenever fish bit, seeming to cum in her pleated skirt as her tail lifted itself up. Her orgasm continued throughout unhooking her pleasure button of a spade end from the fish's jaws. It only subsided once her tail was back in the water, the cold rushing stream most likely jarring her from sodding her panties.I had given her a card before, even seen her around my clinic once, but I never got to ask if she enjoyed the test basket she left with. My large frame keeping me from being able to approach unnoticed.It was unneeded. As we had met before, she welcomed me with a wave. She said she was gathering some fish for someone's lunch. I said that I was practicing my spells, showcasing my level drain on one of her fish. She ooo'ed like a child shown chocolate, watching as orange mana seeped from it and flew to my wrist, where glowing numerals sat to showcase how many levels I have acquired in total.She asked if it could be used on her, curious about how it felt to have her power drained out of her like a vampire sucking blood from a human. I didn't initially feel compelled to, but her insistence and excitement eventually dug deep enough under my skin. I asked her to touch the numerals, feeling her hand clasp onto my own. Her eyes rolled back, her mouth eerily crept up into a grin as her power was transferred to my body. She wasn't a simple battery like the others I soon found out. She was the whole electricity plant. She vibrated like she had set a chair to the highest power, my level counter rapidly climbing up. Normal humans would have fainted after around a dozen levels, but she was willingly pushing power into me, feeding more and more until she had almost doubled, then tripled my amount of mana. She was getting her jollies off as well, a waterfall of secretions dripping onto the soil. Watch it made be aroused, but it would be bad to take advantage of her while she weakened herself to the bone marrow.At least I think she did. Nothing turned pale, nothing about her slowed down. Her eyes slowly returned to view again, her drool bubbling out like she had rabies. I hit one hundred and eighty-five before she finally collapsed into my arms, her nethers still twitching as cum dripped down her thighs like a spilled gallon of water. Her body humped against my bulge until it had cum itself out and she fainted.What followed will go down as one of my weirder few stretches of days. I had set her down beside me, rubbing the lust she gave me out while keeping an eye on her. I had cum about twice before noticing that she was shrinking before my very eyes. I quickly finished a third before rushing over to her, doing a checkup on her health with what I had on hand. She was hot but less than when she was franticly frotting against me like a horny sub. Her clothes shrank with her, losing the wetness it previously had as she turned into some sort of chibi form. I found out later that it was for when she was tired or had low power that needed to be rationed carefully while recharging, or when she felt like being cute.For the time being though, I took care of her, buying a wagon to drag her around so I wouldn't have to carry her. Her small size made it convenient. I decided at some point to try something, also buying a pacifier and a blanket to keep her warm while she slept. I went around town, noting how many people thought I was taking my newborn for a stroll in the neighborhood. I got the look I wanted each time, every person thinking that I had a genuine baby with me, instead of an adorable lilim that had shrunken down to such a vulnerable state.She grew like a child as well, regaining size after a day or so has passed. Her eyes opened the next morning, and she yawned tiredly and rubbed her stomach. I gave her a bento box to eat. I was glad she didn't mind it was from the clinic, where we put some additional ingredients to satisfy our clients that wish to dine without having to stray too far. She followed me around, so I left her in my office each time I had to attend to a client. Around the third time, she was almost to her original size, and lazily floating around my office. I sent her home once she was fully grown, rejecting her wanting to get energy drained again. I gave her my clinic test kit as compensation so she wouldn't feel too dejected.This lilim came back the following week, saying that she wished to spend her time with me while her master was off on a bounty. I blushed as she explained her boredom while changing from her skimpy maid dress into her usual armor. With not a care in the world, her boobs and pussy were flashed multiple times in front of me, and she gave me a good look at her underskirt and thigh-high grey legging portions. She ended with saying that she tried the kit, asking of she can have more with a drawn-out, sensual lick across her lips. I asked her if she felt any different from it. She shook her head, saying that she just really liked the taste. It looked like it would take a larger, maybe much larger dose to have the effect. Luckily, I could provide.I asked if she would like to get treatment, saying we would run out of kits if she kept sampling. She agreed, and I took her to the test room. After having her name on legal papers and optional contracts, I explained to her the process while I disrobed myself. As an incubus, the best way for her to be treated would be directly from my cum nozzle, or in layman's terms my penis. Yes, I have done the proper legal steps to run this with transparency.As soon as she took one sniff, one wiff, one breath in, I knew we could begin. Like a baby sucking on a mother's teat, she slowly got more draw and drawn in by the smell. Her own scent got lustful, but mine could overpower for the time being. I rubbed her against my cock, the pre that throbbed out soaking into her face and hair, I moved more down, trying to bathe her clothed body in my musk. Her clothes were permanently scented, at least I can find a cleaning solution to get out my dick smell. Her armor and skirt matted to her skin like a wet kimono, and the same went for her soaked hair. After the final preparations, it was time to began working on her throat. I laid her flat on the table, aiming my meat stick at her mouth. She realized what was about to happen, opening her top hole even though it wasn't wide enough to swallow my member whole. That was going to change quickly…I placed my hands on her horns, keeping her still as I pushed my leaky tip inside her. My pre filled her mouth in a matter of moments, causing her to swallow as I kept rocking the edge into her mouth. Her eyes batted less, her tail slowed is writhing as the sedative-like precum took effect from the inside. With her as docile as a black bear enjoying some honey, My girth sword started widening her jaw to an unnatural degree. I figured that with her lilim body, she will be able to handle any stretching that she undergoes.Her stomach sounded pretty full with precum alone by the time I had wiggled in my tip, her arms grabbing onto my hips I started widening her throat. It was a common reflex by many of my clients, using my stature to steady themselves while I spread their throat. It helps keep them still as I fuck my shaft inside, the pre now leaking directly down her throat. With all the lubrication it became increasingly easier to move inside her, sliding along with a healthy coating of saliva and precum. I readjusted myself before speeding up, sawing in and out as she made muffled sounds and sucked the pre out. Her tongue did what it could, licking the bit of meat sausage that slide inside her mouth. Her gullet did the rest, the swallowing motions acting like one long wave of pressure that milked me towards her stomach. I shuddered a little, almost losing control and fucking her whole. I looked passed her mouth, seeing a wet spot forming between her outstretched legs. She must have already cum from oral stimulation. She wasn't going to be the only one for much longer.After working her insides to prepare for a fucking, I finally came inside of her. She had already had a stomach patch full of pre, but now she was taking on my first load. My girth dilated as semen rushed to inseminate her digestive system, spraying her stomach hard and not stopping. She inflated like she was a mere holstaur, her eyes rolling back as her midsection expanded. Her nethers drenched itself in its own cum, too overwhelmed to stop itself from firing on all cylinders.I stood for a while, my legs quaking while my balls emptied itself into my lilim condom. After many large spurts, I pulled out of her, leaking into her mouth on onto her face as her body rested on her side. Now she was musky inside and out, with enough cum in here to power her body for a week. Luckily, with my incubi power, I wasn't done.By the time I was, the table she laid on had been covered in shots of baby batter. Her other two holes laid untouched for now, only bukkaked in cum like the rest of her body. I had to remove her top articles of clothing so nothing breaks. She seemed out of it with the last shot my balls could produce, in a half comatose state while my libido was completely done. I somberred over to the papers, making sure to cleans my hands before processing her into the database.After cleaning her up, I sent her off with a pat on the back and a slap on the ass. It was nice, watching a satisfied lilim half-drunkenly leave off. That's what I do at the clinic, provide healthy cum with just a hint of addiction. As if monster girls weren't already inclined to getting semen…I continued my business, but she didn't come back for another week. It was expected; her body was one of a kind, one in a million, that could drain a thousand men and continue on as if nothing had happened. I heard bits and pieces of things that had happened. She had conquered another territory, since the mail from her said that abstinence was the only right way to "cure" her, other than the dozens of death threats they had sent to her Master's mailbox. After that another, after hearing a story from her Master about how they messed up a meal that he had ordered. I heard she got a spanking and locked up in a cage for that one, but like many that the word of mouth spread to, I doubted the Vampire's ability to keep her in check.Nevertheless, she came back, which leads me to the next effect. Her hips and breasts have enlarged from the cum, but only slightly. It was part of the treatment to grace recipients with better assets and health, but for her it was going to take multiple tries to get it to a lewder form. In the meantime, her next appointment was for a tattoo and collar. I took the smiling cum demon to a parlor inside of the clinic, where a worker tattooed on a barcode for tracking and ownership purposes, then a butterfly as she requested. She was then given a custom-designed pink collar for later, and to cover her neck tattoo. A quick test with her cleavage and she was sent on her way, horny with my smell and cum on her chest, face, and hair to last her until the next session.The next session was a house call. I had gotten her address prior, and scheduled for when her Master was gone. She was wearing her maid outfit, still dawning the color from earlier. The smell from my cock was embedded in her, still smelling like I had her lewded her, with a mix of fresh soap. On the agenda was pet play. It surprised me at first when the ruler of 3 demon realms was a pet play sub, but then again, we could both mutually enjoy the time. I decided to keep her in a maid outfit, seeing as she could simply get another one and keep this one for our business purposes. After coloring her, we traveled to one of her realms, the lilim walking on all fours the entire time. By the time we had reached her kingdom, her hands and barefoot feet were covered in dirt and dust from the various terrain we traversed.We first walked to the park, basking in the light blood moon on a nice bench. I was able to get a few good pats and head rubs in, listening to her bark and pant like a contempt dog before she leaped onto me and nuzzled her way into the crook of my elbow. I got a hard-on from the affection, but it was no time to act on it. For now, I just rubbed her wings and tails, getting jealous looks from couples as she napped on my lap.After enough moonlight in my skin, I took my pet maid to a restaurant to eat. I jokingly told the waiter that I needed a cat bowl for my lilim, but she actually brought her food out in one. I watched her eat under the table, her butt arched up and swaying as she finished her food and clean out her bowl like the dog she was. After that she helped mitigate my growing lust with a bit of encouragement, lapping and sucking the cum that came out of my cock while I finished my own meal. On my last spoonful I twitched, semen shooting out into her broken-in throat, the rest spilling in a bowl to lap up like milk after she was done.Finally, we went to the central castle, using the room to have a bout of sex. In satin sheets, I mating pressed her while she mewled loud enough to be heard in the next room down. Each thrust grew faster as her unspoiled pussy got wetter and wetter with our lube. I wished to save the moment I creampied her for the next session, but one twitch led to another. Locking lips with her, her legs forced my entire body into hers as I orgasmed. My moans filled the expansive bedroom, while she just coo'ed like she was being only ate out, instead of violently humped against like a sow. My orgasm didn't stop until my sack felt as dry as a desert, and even then, her convulsing pussy milked out whatever drops they could produce like a black hole.We stayed locked until my "pet" finally relaxed her powerful thighs, going lip on the bed while I fell back. My penis came out with a hard slick, being sucked completely clean of cum. Her insides were inseminated, with layers of jizz caking every inch of her folds in her now agape cunt. I have no doubt she had been impregnated, but I was willing to confirm it with a second ejaculation once I recovered.Sure enough, she grew pregnant in the coming months, eventually deciding to stay over at the clinic for convenience. To date, she has received treatments to keep up the energy for her and the baby, milking me in all three of her holes, then giving me a job with every part of her body until she was in a thick blanket of nut. Her breasts started lactating, her milk being one of the best I have ever tried. Soon, I wish to keep as my pet permanently, giving birth to my children while tending to my intensive libido in the clinic.Mr. D
Jaron's eyes shot open, completely stumped about everything he had just seen. He slowly sat up, looking right, then left. Sure enough, the only thing bizarre enough to cause such a dream was beside him, holding his hand as it glowed green with her spell. "Morning master!""Who the fuck is Dyna?" Was the first question he asked. "His name is Dyna? I see, so that's where that timeline leads...""Timeline? W-what!?" He inspected her body, making sure his lilim hadn't undergone those transformations. Her breasts and hips were larger, but not to the size he saw in the dream. There was no collar nor tattoo either. However, she was not in her armor nor maid uniform that she apparently had, but in a white kimono that only covered her midsection. Cups went halfway up her breasts, and the portion where it was put together shrunk in, leaving an entire thigh open to see, but not her nethers. Her kimono was edged out with red, and the line that went around her waist was black and gold strips side by side."Where did you get this?" He asked. "From the kingdoms I took over, it was fun. ^^""Cage!" Jaron said, Calice pouting as she trudged to it. After sitting in it and locking herself in, Jaron went in, making sure too much sun didn't pour in from the windows. He recollected himself, rubbing the bridge between his eyes. "So, why would you show me that?""Well I wanted to look at an alternate reality me, but I can't use my powers on my own mind so I thought it would work with you, and it did!""So you used my mind without asking?""It was a dream I thought you would forget!"As he got angry once more, he realized that he was one of the only outlets she had in this house. Something like this could very well happen again, and she needed someone else, someone else that she could empty out all her quirkiness and invasion of space on. She needed…"Calice, wouldn't a monster girl like you have a husband?" Jaron asked. Calice shook her head. "I am too busy spending time with you master!""Would you like one?" he asked. Calice was speechless, thinking she was being proposed to. Her pale cheeks blushed, an endearing smiling creeping up on her face. A tiny squeal was building up in her while she bounced up and down like a child on a sugar high. "I don't mean me, simmer down!" He clarified."Oh…well then who?" She was less ecstatic, but nevertheless excited. "An old partner of mine from the old days. But!" He held up a finger, tapping Calice's nose. "You must spend the majority of your time with him. He will be your husband, not me."And so they were off, taking the journey to go meet the soulmate Calice shall gain. It was a long treacherous hike through the valley of death, where one wrong step through a pathway could mean falling to your doom. It was also an avoidable one since Calice could fly and carry her master over with ease.Their next mountain to climb was the tentacle swamp. Many couples have spent days trapped in here, stuck in a cycle of lust and sex-fueled by the needles laced with an aphrodisiac which, also ended up being flown over...really Dan, is there anything that could keep her from flying over….
  What do you mean you- just think of some spell or something! 

  Fine fine, you know what? Fuck you Dan. I have to do everything don't I?

  You don't get paid to give me your fucking sass, just get the description for this husband dude ready, Jesus Christ.
Sorry for that reader, I am back at the microphone; a coworker of mine was acting like an uncreative bitchy piece of shit. Now then...their final obstacle was….hmm...oh, wow he just gave up really creative Dan! Fine, how about...They have reached the livelihood of Jaron's friend, but now, they have to get to his house, safe within the confines of the village. "I can fly us over it again!" Calice said, staring at the village from afar. "No, if you fly, you will be downed by marksman guards immediately. We must go undercover…" He looked at his armored self then at his Lilim, still wearing the kimono from earlier. "Well, you must go undercover.""Oooh! You can tie me up and say that I'm your bounty!""No I….actually yes, I can. But did you bring-""Rope?" Calice finished, going into some bushes before coming out with some rope, although a bit slimy. "I rinsed it in my cum~""Why would you need to….we need to get you to him fast." Jaron took his mind off his newfound headache for now, drying the rope against some tree bark before binding Calice's limbs together. He cut a piece off and gagged her for insurance, and so no further words came out of her mouth for the time being. Sure enough, the guards left them alone, as the succubi looked too bound to pose any danger.They reached a cozy-looking colonial, with smoke coming out of the chimney. Jaron knocked on the door, setting Calice down on the ground and sitting down on the steps. He turned his head when the door opened a sliver, a blue eye eyeing the two on his front steps. "Who goes there Jaron?" Came the voice from beyond the door. "You know I can't house people you've grown fond of.""I know….that. But I've come with a bride.""A bride?" Is eye widened in interest. "Does she have a fluffy tail that I can pat?" His view wandered over to Calice, who's large lilim tail waved around. He went down to her head, seeing hours and pointy succu ears. "Hmm….she's no inari Jaron, but the tail would be sufficient. Does she like adventures?""Um, yes?" Jaron said, not knowing what that meant after all those years of mostly ignoring his requests to tag along with him. The eye nodded, opening the door to let her in. Jaron untied her secretly and nudged her inside, following them before his acquaintance closed the door. His vision weirdly started to fade as he watched Merlin look around Calice, the lilim smiling at him from behind her gag as she was inspected…Jaron's eyes shot open, completely stumped...no, weirded out not by everything he had just seen, but by why he was waking up again. He slowly sat up, looking right, then left. Sure enough, the only thing bizarre enough to cause such a dream was beside him, holding his hand as it glowed green with her spell. "Morning master~""Who the fuck is- wait, no, I know Merlin, what is this?""An inception reference!""What is….nevermind," he said, groaning as he sat up from the bed and stretched. "Let me guess, you want to marry my old bounty partner now?" He asked. Calice nodded, cat ears growing on top of her head. "If I need to nya, I can turn myself into a beastman for him nya! Maybe even have a child nya that would even be in this story's spinoff nya!"
  
    Chapter Text
    "Do you want to have a child?" Headen asked Night as they laid on the bed in her castle. "We've been together for long enough I feel...this mutual agreement can blossom.""You want to become part of my harem? Don't you lead your people?""Just like you can have multiple wives, I can be a wife and a queen." She kissed Night on the cheek, the dragon incubus returning the kiss swiftly. "What about Isuka? Do you think she would join?""No, she has her eyes on someone else I presume. More shota-esque. Besides…" They both looked at her, the only part of her visible from their place were the lower part of her legs. The rest of her had fallen off the bed, laying there dazed after their last round of sex had left her tired. "...she's probably not listening.""So, you fucked a dragon?" Kiris asked, pouring tea for Isuka. "Is that why you were so out of it when you came back?""It's not what you think, I would never do such a thing! I just had sexual intercourse with one." She picked up the cup and drank from it, seeming embarrassed from it. "He was my first in a while, so it was just jarring.""In a while? Don't you have Natsumi to help with Spirit Energy?""I merely freed him, not married him. How was your day with Di?" She asked."Boy, where do I start!? Oh, we started at the edge of the universe, and we went on a road trip through space! Then, we had a party at her castle.." She ranted about the things the group did, but Isuka couldn't help but lose track as she thought about the succubus's question. She never considered it, but how long has it really been ever since she last had sex before Night?"Oi, you're looking at my boobs. Are they nice?" Isuka looked up from her thinking stupor, seeing Kiris moving her succubus jugs about in her hands. "You like my personalities? You know how they can get bigger right?""Quiet slut, I wasn't focused on you. And stop being so indecent, do that to incubi, not me.""Why not? Besides, why don't you like sex? You are a Dark Mage after all…" She scooted closer to Isuka, leaning over as she pressed a boob to her side. Isuka retreated, but Kiris kept pressing until they both tripped and landed on the floor, facing chest to chest. "I said stop!"Kiris paused for a moment; something was off about the way Isuka jumped back. She had seen priests panic from a succubus, but this wasn't as funny. "Something is wrong. You haven't even used any spells on me…" She grabbed one of the dark mage's breasts, cupping it in her hands. "Do you want me to stop? Or...." Isuka looked away from Kiris' concerned stare, yelping for a second when Kiris squeezed. "F-fine, I….I just got monsterized by a Lilim…""Oh, I can relate to that. A little trama would definitely mess a former orderite up. Especially when you're monsterized without the proper care or mindbreak.""I wasn't an orderite…" she said, blushing as Kiris undid her mage robes, her D-cups in plain view of the succubus's eyes. "I just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time…""And you hated her for it. Druella didn't even wipe your memory?""How did you know it was- eeeeaaai!~" Her question was cut off by Kiris sucking on one of her teats. She moved her tongue around the areola until she didn't see any more words from Isuka's mouth. "Quiet mage. I am enjoying this body. It is a shame you locked it away for so long, that was a fate worse than purification.""I don't even m-make breastmilk, w-why are you sucking so hard!?~" Kiris stopped, but pushed Isuka back down and sat on top of her. "Do you want to have sex or not?" She asked."No! I mean..""Because the way I see it, everyone that I have met so far has a partner except you.""What about Virto? He is just as a shut-in as I am.""He is going out with an inari. You are alone Isuka, and whatever has happened in your past is gone now. You can live!""But…""Hey, I have an idea. We can find you someone together!" Kiris brought them both up, spreading her wings to prepare for flight. Before she could voice an objection, she had shot through the roof, carrying Isuka off on their quest to find her a boyfriend.a"Kiris, I know you are a succubus, but why did you take us to a love hotel?" She asked, looking up at the sign. "It's the perfect town to stay, and women get to stay free! Do you wanna know why?""I don't think I do-""Because sex!" She whispered in Isuka's ear. "Here, we will be able to help you get over your...um…""Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.""...worries about having sex. Come on, don't you trust me?" She extended a hand out to Isuka, the mage rolling her eyes as she took the hand. They went into the hotel, checking themselves in and getting a room key before heading to their room. Sounds of sex rang through the doors as they walked. "You see, the women get to stay for free, while the men pay to stay and lewd the females. By getting a room, we basically agree to have sex, right?""So this hotel is an incentive to fuck.""Exactly!" Kiris stopped at one room, opening the door to let themselves in. "I chose the grander option, which just means more men in one room. On the plus side, it means you have your own bed to do whatever you do.""One bed to serve an orgy of men is not a great….deal." The dark mage trailed off as she walked into the main part of the bedroom. There were not one, but two, queen-sized mattresses, shaped in the form of hearts and layered with blankets made up of wool. The bedside tables had everything one would need for a night of sex, from simple lube to collars and ropes if the group decides to get a bit kinky. Other than that, it had all the amenities of a normal expensive hotel room. "I thought this place would be more of a sex dungeon…" Isuka said, peering into the bathroom."Of course, now we just have to wait for someone to come along. With these rooms, we tend to get customers in groups. Easier for everyone to split the bill." Kiris shed her clothing, digging in a chest that was beside one of the beds. "It's also better if you change out of your clothes, it's going to get dirty." Isuka nodded and followed the example, hesitating when the only thing that covered the most skin was a bunny outfit. "I...I don't want to do this.""Come on, if you're going to have sex then you must be able to feel comfortable in clothing. Here." Kiris gave Isuka her own clothes. "It covers a tad more, but it is still pretty skimpy. We'll work our way down.""Thank you," she said, changing into Kiris's skirt. For how different their proportions were, it still fit as snug as a bedsheet. She looked at herself in a mirror, trying to look at herself in such implying clothes. "I'll take…nothing. I will just do this night naked," Kiris said, packing Isuka's clothes into the chest before closing it and sealing it with a lock. "How do you feel Isuka?""I...I have a father…""That's the spirit! Now, while we wait for some studs to come along, you can practice on this!" She held up a dildo the size of her forearm. "Most cocks aren't this big, but it's good for practicing taking one." Isuka started inching away towards the door in fear, but Kiris stopped her and lead her back onto the bed. "Now, lay down…""S-she's going to appear again…I can feel it..." Isuka started shuddering, clutching onto Kiris's arm. "I can't do this. She's going to summon her tentacles and..""Druella is thousands of acres away in hiding. Trust me, she can't hurt you anymore. Just hold my hand and-" Kiris felt her drag her entire arm against her, using Kiris to cover her view like a shield. "That will work as well. Now, I'm going to move it closer to your vagina alright?""Y-yes Kiris…""Do you want to watch it go in?" Isuka nodded, uncovering her eyes to make sure nothing nefarious would happen to her. Sure enough, the dildo was lined up exactly where she said it was. Kiris pressed the dildo against her folds, using her tail to stuff Isuka's mouth. She felt her voice vibrate against the spade, sending a low wave of pleasure up into her. "If you keep screaming like that, I'm going to move too fast for you…" she said, pushing the dildo in further to feel more of her screams.Isuka twitched as her pussy was spread farther than she anticipated. As the cold phallus went into her, everything started turning darker than the pink ambiance that filled the bedroom. "Kiris?" her voice went through the tail gag. Everything in the room was fading away, turning into a darker, more malicious setting. Her heart started racing as she looked around, being all too familiar with this room. She started to get up, but chains were suddenly bound on her wrists and ankles. It was just Kiris, she just doesn't want her to rush out so soon?"If it's just Kiris, why am I here then?" Went the voice. That horrid voice. Isuka didn't want to look at how it is, as she had already been through this nightmare before. "No words dear? Not even after you so rudely came at me with a book as thick as your skull?" The slow walk of her heels got louder. The candlelight that illuminated this torture chamber acted a shadow that laid on the floor where Isuka directed her vision."My sources told me that you were trying to be rid of me, were you not?" Isuka was silent, staying that way until a sharp crack of a lilim tail landed on her thigh. "Were you not!?""Y-yes…." she reluctantly answered back. "You're lucky I'm even this composed. I have the mind to turn you into a broodmare for the rest of your natural lifespan! But...that would be a waste of your mind." Isuka could feel her heart pounding as five digits winded themselves around her cheek, and forced her to stare up into Druella's god awful sneer. "I'll curse you like I have every night you tried to rid yourself of my presence. You were better off just becoming another one of my pawns dear, but instead, you get to roam and turn everything you loved into a land of depravity~""So that is what has been going on," rang another voice. Her presence felt just as powerful as Druella's. Isuka begged to anyone listening that it was not another lilim, so she could be monsterized in front of more of an audience…"Di?" Druella asked. "I'll have you know it is rude to barge in on a sister's private time.""And I'll have you know it's rude to keep one of my pets' friends traumatized," Di said, making her way into the room. "This spell you placed on her is not going to be here much longer.""Like you ever stood up to your older siblings. Just get out of here while you still can. I have a Mage to create." The entrance to the room they were in was closed off by a waterfall of dark matter, but the celestial being didn't waver. Isuka, unable to understand the silence, willed the courage to look up at the two. They stared at each other, Druella's eyebrows arched as she gave one last moment for her to move. Di still didn't budge, but her face looked more irritated than she had ever been before.The moment the doors closed, hundreds of tentacles made out of dark matter moved up and towards Di, all of them crashing down on her like a tidal wave. Any trace of her was instantly gone amongst a sea of liquid darkness, draining away back into the ground as if nothing had happened. Any hope of rescue that wanted to build up had suck back down into her, never to return.Druella let out a wholehearted laugh, cackling at the seemly useless attempt. "Look at you, thinking you could bring someone to help cure you! And now, you and her both will pay the price." She turned back to Isuka, the tendrils rising up, only this time, it was around her. She screamed, but nothing came out of her vocal cords. She only closed her eyes and waited for the same horribleness that always transpired.
  Shing
The sound of a blade cut off everything, the light of the sun hitting her face. Isn't it night? She thought opening her eyes to her laying or floating in the water. It was just water around her, her body staying above the waterline like a bug. Her head was propped up on Di's lap, seeing her stare out into the infinite horizon. "Have you heard of water tension, Isuka?" She asked. "It's a neat phenomenon that allows objects that should, by all accounts sink, to float." She patted the water under her, small waves going out in a circle. "The bonds of the water on the surface are strong enough to not be broken. It is why we can sit on the surface as of now.""But, we're larger than a needle…""Not if we use our bond to float.""How...are you even here?" Isuka asked, her gears turning as she quickly figured out her own question. "You realized it, haven't you? I guess I gave it away when I realized who had turned you…""But...why?""Isn't it obvious? I wouldn't want any underling of mine to have to deal with sadness, so I'll deal with your past for you. Of course I recognize that a lilim isn't the best person to solve a problem a lilim caused, but it does make it easier when the solver has the power.""I...I trust you if Kiris trusts you.""A third party trust...as skeptical as Virto aren't you?" Di said, putting her finger over Isuka's lips. "Now wake up from your nightmare. Kiris has been calling you for minutes now, my new plaything. Do not fear, your mind is in good hands now….Water splashed on Isuka's face as her eyes blinked open, seeing Kiris with some other men all surrounding her. "Oh thank goodness, you're awake!" She said, hugging the dazed dark mage as all the men in the room cheered. "You started screaming, and then the group that came in got worried, so we all started trying to wake you up with water and pepper…""Thank you, but.." She got up, rubbing her head as a headache came before disappearing just as fast. It was like a chronic thing had left her after so long… "who are all these people Kiris?""Isn't it obvious? They are the customers. Don't worry, no one did any lewding while you were gone. Them being naked doesn't make you scared, does it?""No, it...it doesn't!" She moved closer to one of the men, touching and nuzzling his cock. "I, I can look at phallic and not be terrified!""It worked!" Kiris said, just about bouncing on the bed. One of the men waiting beside the floor raised their hand. "Does this mean we can start the fucking? I don't mean to be pushy but, I just came here to get laid and go home.""Oh yes, the reason you are here." She pulled Isuka over back to her, shaping her into a pose with two hands raising peace signs. "I usually come here alone, but today I've brought a very special guest with me today~. She hasn't had sex before she was monsterized, and has just gotten over her fear of lewds!""Madam, does that mean you are a virgin?~""If she was monsterized why would she be a virgin?""...Good point.""Now then," Kiris said, turning to Isuka. "Who do you want to be your first?" Not sure how to pick, she picked a person on the far left, who looked to be the most average-looking guy in the group of men surrounding them. "What is your name?" She asked him. The guy rubbed the back of his neck, blushing when she pointed to him. "Keita….you know, there are many other guys that would probably give you a better time…""Maybe." She took his hand and went over into the other bed, leaving Kiris to serve the rest of them that weren't picked. While debauchery took place in the other bed, Isuka had pulled the curtains on the other, sealing the two of them off inside their own place. "So, what do you wish to do first?""I don't know, Darein said that when you come here, all you would find is hot women, but...you're both cute and hot.""You're...cute and handsome," she responded, the two of them blushing as they started to make out under the covers…The rest of the night, sounds of male satisfaction could be heard from that room, just like every room in the love hotel. streams of spunk accumulated on Kiris, and Isuka after Keita had fallen asleep, leaving her to get a crash course in everything sex. Both of them took turns being used like whores, always having a cock around them as balls were emptied and spirit energy was absorbed. Pauses only happened to quickly change their cosplay, until those clothes were also soaked by repeated orgasms.Hours passed without thought until the sun finally rose once more above the horizon. Almost every man had passed out with smiles on faces and limp members, the last two on their last orgasms as they thrusted into Kiris and Isuka. The two were sixty-nining on each other, licking the cocks that thrusted into their semen coated pussies. They speed up in one last bout before ejaculating their last loads into them, thrusting further to churn the cum deeper into their wombs. The four of them finally fell asleep, Isuka slipping off Kiris onto the ruined bed. Semen was leaking out of her womb and had gotten everywhere on her skin until it made her shine like oil. Her eyes drifted asleep, finally to a dream where she could be free from her fears.

    "Sometimes, I just get this feeling that things revolve around me, you know?" Virto says, overlooking the ground below them with Vargas. "I don't have protagonist syndrome, I think, but it's like there's someone out there, just reading what I say to you.""Even when we're high up on this cloud?" He asks back, running his hand along the puffy substance. "It would be hard for even tengu to be here for long.""Even then. Is it me, or is your mom shining a bit less bright today?" He looked up at the sun, covering its view with his hand, but sensing something off about its power. "Do not worry, it is just the harvest season. As yokai, it is our duty to make sure the seasons come and go properly. Would it truly be autumn if the sun felt like summer?""I guess not. Oh yeah, Ganan's going to her first meeting on her own right?""Yes." Vargas kept ground gazing from his spot, seeing a couple float through a river. "It is a special harvest season as well, as we have another Yokai that will be joining the association.""beastman-ki or elemental-ki?""Dragon-ki.""Fancyyy, are you going?""But if I went, we wouldn't be able to go on our picnic later, and I am very excited to try these soft shell tacos you talk of." The kitsune quickly pecked Virto on the cheek. "From what you say, they taste just as good as you.""Keep sweet talking me like that and I might actually turn into alp. Now, you see any clouds?" Vargas' eyes stayed locked on Virto, his tails beginning to sway behind him. "Nope, but you're making me feel as light as one."After staring down at the ground, Virto decided that the next place to spend their day would be at the library, mostly to continue to work on his watch while the kitsune watched with interest. "So you're saying that the watch helps you stave off demonic mana?""Yeah," Virto responds, pressing a button on his watch to show a holographic display. On it, listed several different graphs on the data from the watch, none of which the kitsune understood a single bit. "So, very, very interesting view Virto…""I get it, someone once called my lighter 'elemental sweat'. This is like a sort of...it...alright, it tells you how I, and the watch are doing through math and numbers." He points to one graph, colored blue, white, and red. "This manages my Spirit energy and Demonic energy. The more red there is than white, the more demon mana in my system, and vise versa." He points to a small version of the graph, that was labeled 'average levels' with small letters. "This one is more important. If this one is more red than white, then that means that I'm more incubi or monster girl than human.""I think I understand," he says."Good, because we are going to test how good the watch is at keeping me human.""Do you mean…" Vargas stands up, watching as Virto undid his ponytail, and let his green hair flow freely over the back of the chair. "I will admit, I don't have the greatest body, but we have been together for quite some time now. A month, actually," he said, getting up and stripping himself of his lap coat and clothing under. Vargas blushed at seeing him naked for the first time, a tent forming rather quickly in his kimono. "I guess then it works…"…They fucked into the late light of the falling sun, until falling asleep in the same room they started in. As losing your anal virginity and getting creampied many times would do, Virto had forgotten all about the main reason he had agreed to their first round of intercourse together. Vargas had long since lost the thought as well and was currently holding his man in tails while hugging him in sleep. Virto fell asleep like that, to the steady beat of the watch, left on the counter, doing its warning beep about his DE levels rising."I move….king to D5," Holi said, shifting her dream-created piece up the board. The whispered fuck under Virto's breath told it all, a smug look taking over her face. "Guessing that's a checkmate then?""No is a resign. Although, it was nice of Di to connect our dreamscapes so we could do this though," Virto said, the board disappearing like a bad special effect. "Yes, now I can torment Ice however much I want~""Who's Ice?""That is not important, as I am tormenting you right now Virto." Holi held out her hands, watching as popcorn fell into them on command. "Do you have any more memories we could explore? I want to see what other games you have stored besides chess." She started going through his mind, looking for anything that stuck out to her to look at. She found one from his childhood, of him, doing a weirdly enticing handshake with a fellow classmate. "Who is this child? He has short black hair and a darker complexion.""That would be Lalu, but we called him Lao for short," he said. "If anyone knew I was gone, it would be him since he comes over every weekend to use my printer.""Your mind tells me Lao was a close friend. It also says that a printer is like a printing press, but with gremlin technology," Holi says with hands-on her temples like a prediction maker. Her brow was furrowed, as she kept looking through his memories for another board game."No crap, but how far are you looking back? I was as nerdy as they came, so I don't exactly have any dark secrets to laugh at." He got his answer quickly, as a monopoly board appeared on the table between them. "Far enough to find this! Now get ready to lose all of your money, and then fuck me to pay it off~" she said, her lewd smug face returning to her."It's fake money," He protested, but she seemed ament on turning the scientist into an indentured servant. "Fine, but I get the race car. I woulder how Lao is doing anyways..."An older and more mature Lao was staring at the door to Virto's once lived-in home. It had been empty since the scientist had mysteriously disappeared weeks ago. He clutched the flower bouquet in his hand as a tear streamed down his eyes, frustrated at how the one week he didn't come over to visit, his friend had vanished in thin air.No one in the neighborhood heard or saw a peep. Virto had never really interacted with his neighborhoods, they said. He understood that. That guy had always been a bit of a recluse, to the point where he let his hair grow for years without cutting it. Their third friend had jokingly said that if he dyed his hair green, he would look like he's cosplay an anime character from an anime she had watched.Virto's immediate friend group didn't expand farther than him and Leana, the anime watcher. He had his coworkers and the students he taught, but besides him and Leana, no one else came over to hang out with him outside of work. Family was off and on, as Virto never kept too much in touch with his folks. No one even showed up when his body was reported missing…A lady and her daughter walked by, staring at the black man who was dressed as if he came from a funeral. The daughter came by and hugged him before her mother quickly pulled her away. He turned around, seeing the small girl hugging his leg until she was picked up by the mother. "Sorry about that sir, she is a bit hyperactive today," she said, walking off, carrying the child in her arms. "But mama, you always say that hugging makes you happy," she whined, before getting out of earshot of him.He went back to staring at the door but thought back to the hug. He checked the time, thinking that he had gotten here at around 1, or 2. It was four; he had been like this for two hours. Shit, she's right… he thought as he finally moved. He remembered that Virto had always left a spare key somewhere, changing the location every two days to 'keep security up.' Sure enough, the key was still there, in between a gap between a rather large crack in the sidewalk. The door opened with a creek as Lao came into the house. He had made sure no realtors had come to refurbish the place on the promise that either he, Leana, or his brother would keep paying the rest of the mortgage. Everything had been left exactly as it was before.He decided to look around one last time, unable to accept Virto leaving him without a shred of evidence. Even the best murderer leaves something right!? He yelled in his mind as he shuffled around. He prepared to be disgusted by bones, maybe surprised by calling cards, a reaction to something. He got nothing, from nothing, by nothing. Except for one room in the house. Out of respect to his possible dead friend, he had not stepped a foot in it. It was the door to his basement.He remembers jokingly hiding in the stairway down, but Virto had chewed him out after catching him there. It was the most heated he got, mostly because what he did down there wasn't sanctioned by an IRB, nor zoned and cleared by the location he lived. If anything happens down there, the last thing I would want is it to be you or Leana involved, he remembered him saying. Lao's current logic? It is legally his house until Virto miraculously came back, and Virto was presumed dead. Worst come to worst, he can pretend he didn't know about the secrets that lied under the first floor. Still, he put on a hazmat suit and sent a text to his brother in case he disappears as well.Even with wearing something that completely sealed his body off from harmful elements, he could still feel the hairs on his short fade stand up as he opened the door. The hairs on the rest of the body stood up as well, as he saw the second door, the door the lead to the unknown, left ajar.
  Virto never ever left that door open.
He turned on his phone light to shine his way down the steps, turning on the stair lights for safety. The fact that he didn't need to unlock this door made him think that something went awry. He pushed open the door, taking his first steps into the basement. The lights didn't work, leaving only his phone flashlight to get him around in total darkness. After a while of searching, he could thankfully rule out things like aliens, or slimy creatures that went loose as he looked at everything. No evidence of a scuffle or slimy mucus spread out across various surfaces. He didn't put it past Virto to test on a human in the moment, but there was a lack of blood, nor sign of any other creature living here.It only made the ambiance worse, as the lack of anything happening put him more on edge. Each random creak of old machinery or a pencil dropping of the desk would cause him to turn. He so wanted to leave right then and there, but the light of the stairs was long gone.Finally, he had reached a different light source. A purple hue shined from around the corner. Like a moth to a lamp, he was drawn to it. With no weapons and only a probably tearable suit for protection, he rounded the corner and peered around.A swirling portal was there, illuminating the small room in purple light. A cut and burned rope laid under it, along with a pile of since rotted apples. He looked around in every crevice, double-checking if there was anything that could jump out at him. While searching, he had found a videotape, labeled "please watch this." Curious, he found a player and started watching the events that had unfolded. He saw Virto talking to a camera, speaking of some technology that could not only revolutionize travel but make traveling to livable plants that are lightyears away possible. It went smoothly at first, the portal coming on and Virto tossing a few apples inside. Then he himself went in, and….nothing. Lao's heart sank as he saw the rope get violently pulled taunt, and snapped in two. "Damn….""You're probably thinking right now that I am gone forever."Lao looked up, seeing Virto talking again. He's back! No...it must have changed to a backup recording."I probably am, but as long as the portal is kept running...even if not the portal, the tech that saved the data...I will always be within reach.""Most likely, it's probably either Lao or Leana watching this. Only they have enough care to break the one rule I have. Which reminds me, you broke the one rule you [bleep]!""Even when dead you're as defensive as ever Virto…""But, I do want to thank you. I never told you this, but I did like those times you two dragged me out of my studies to do...normal things. I never thought of myself as deserving of people, not even my mother who I keep forgetting to call...yet you two stuck around.""If you choose to finally go live without someone like me weighing you down, there is nothing stopping you. On the chance, you don't...""Of course not!""I have devised a way for you to save me, without your body leaving the room you're in. After some test runs and modifications, I then made it so it will keep you alive and healthy while you do. Your body would move, talk with others, and go about its day as if nothing has happened, while your consciousness is busy tracking me down, or getting just as lost like me.""There is a chair in the corner of the room. It is connected to the portal, and it has two buttons. The first strap you in for the procedure. The next will knock your consciousness unconscious, and, in a sense, separate your soul from your body, and send only your soul through the portal. Leana would call it Isekai.""As with most of your motor functions, your brain will fill in for your life while you are busy in the world I'm in. It isn't a guarantee this will be a success, and there will be side effects and consequences. I tried to make it as user-free as possible, so when you are ready, press the red button, and pray? Pray probably. Make a decision here or upstairs, but don't explore the lab! I do keep a slimy alien creature down here you might stumble on, and yes, there is a chance you could die or be broken from it putting eggs up your-"The video ended on that note, showing static before only a blank blue screen was on. Lao shuddered at the thought of an alien as he pointed a flashlight at the corner. Sure enough, a chair with retracted restraints was there, with two buttons placed on the left armrest. Virto himself had warned that it could be a very disastrous decision, but when you have a chance of rescuing a friend, what more could your tragedy-plagued mind ask for?

Thank you to everyone that read all 17 chapters of this stuff. It took about 3 months, but I managed to write this out. Hopefully, the next seasons make more sense than this one, but for now, I'm glad I got to throw up my thoughts paper and pass it off as fanfiction.

Somewhere, at some time, an Imp looks up towards the sky, stargazing at the moon. Suddenly, he sees a purple pulse go through the sky as if a bomb had gone off above, yet there was no bang. It was unlike anything he had seen before and it disappeared just as randomly as it came. It would be a sight the imp could just throw away, as a fun quick story to tell his dad.If he hadn't remembered this same absurd thing happening weeks ago.….He decides to look into it.
