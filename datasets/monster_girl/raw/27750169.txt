  February 13, 2020. 6:30 AM
 
  
    And so, another day began…
  
 
  “GOOD MORNING, 
  
    GEORGE MASON!
  
  ”exclaimed Ian, practically 
  
    yeeting
  
   himself out of bed. It was a Thursday!
 
  “And you know what that means, don’t you, Eli?” Ian turned to face the nesoberi present on the other side of the room. The nesoberi was, of course, silent as ever, staring directly forward, unyielding. “Ike’s has 
  
    apple muffins
  
  !” He grabbed the plush, shaking it up and down. “Oooh, they’re mah favorite! They almost taste like 
  
    real food
  
  !” Ian put the nesoberi down and patted its head. 

  “OKAY!” It was time to move on.
 
  “Alexa, what’s today’s weather gonna be?”
 
  The machine clicked on.
 
  “
  
    Currently, in Fairfax County, Virginia, it is 31
  
  
    o
  
  
     Farenheight. Expect it to be partly cloudy all day. High, 42
  
  
    o
  
  
    . Low, 26
  
  
    o
  
  
    .”
  
 
  “
  
    Thank you, Alexa~
  
  ”, said Ian somewhat singsonginly.
 
  Ian went from his rather dingy room to the even dingier bathroom the dorm floor  shared. “Ah well, nothin’ much I can do about that!”, Ian thought to himself. Wilson Hall, floor two, could be described as having seen better days… if such days had ever existed in the first place.
 
  And thus, Ian started his morning routine. Shower, Shave, Take his vitamins, Brush his teeth, Get dressed (polo and khakis forever), and Head to Ike's dining hall for breakfast. Day in and day out, virtually like clockwork. The residents of President’s Park could practically set their watches to Ian, if any of them ever bothered to go outside for more than classes, meals, and Patriot Activity Committee planned parties.
 
  “Today is Thursday, so that means I’ve got Comms, German, Music, 
  
    and
  
   Astronomy.” Ian was alone in his room, packing his bag for the day. “Got all the binders, pencils, notebook, 
  
    no calculator required today,
  
   the laptop, and… Oh...” Was he forgetting something?
 
  “Of course! 
  
    I can’t forget Eli!
  
  ” Yes. The doll. Why did he need it? Ian had forgotten as to 
  
    why
  
   he started taking the nesoberi with him everyday, but at this point, it had become somewhat of tradition. Besides, it was college. You could get away with stuff like this, at least in your first year. 
 
  At precisely 8:40 local time, Ian headed out for the day, kicking out the dorm room door.

  Not much could be said about the bulk of Ian’s day. However, something was different about 
  
    this
  
   Thursday. Ian could feel it, but he couldn’t feel what 
  
    it
  
   was. He didn’t leave anything at the dorm, and he’d turned in all his work on time, so what could 
  
    it
  
   be? He asked his friend Matthew about it at lunch, again at Ike’s. 

  “
  
    I dunno my guy, that just sounds like a bad bit of anxiety.
  
  ”, said Matthew.

  “Yeah, I suppose so.”, said Ian.
 
  “
  
    Haven’t you checked out CAPS yet? They’re supposed to help us with that stuff.
  
  ”
 
  “Yeah, I did, back in November. Problem is, the lady there just referred me to professional therapists. And those cost 
  
    real money
  
  .”
 
  “
  
    I dunno what else to tell you, my guy.
  
  ”
 
  “Fair enough.”
 
  Ian looked to the side.
 
  “G u h.”, he spurted.

   There was some creepy looking girl standing outside of Ike’s, with deep pink hair in twin drills and an ahoge and somewhat of a scowl on her face. Ian wasn’t sure if she was ten or thirty. As soon as she looked at Ian, that anxious feeling multiplied by ten. One could practically feel the “ゴゴゴゴ” coming off of her.
 
   Matthew looked at Ian with a rather befuddled expression. 
 
  
    “My guy, is something up?
  
  ”
 
  “Maybe...  D’ya see her?” Ian gestured to the mystery figure.
 
  “
  
    Yeah… I dunno what her problem is, but she kinda gives me the creeps to be honest with ya…
  
  ”
  
    
    
  

  “I think I know her from 
  
    somewhere
  
  .”, said Ian.
  
    
  

  “
  
    Really?
  
  ”
 
  “Think so. Can’t say where from, though. Maybe she’s in my Comms class?”
 
  The two wrapped up their meal, and Ian headed back to his dorm to study, like some kind of NERD who actually. That same feeling of menacing dread still lingered around him. Later, on his way to Astronomy class, for no reason in particular, he found himself humming along to “Fukkireta”.

  
  

  10:00 PM
 
  “(Astronomy class is supposed to be my favorite)”, Ian thought to himself. “(So why do I 
  
    still
  
   have that terrible, MENACING, feeling?” He couldn’t concentrate on the lecture, something about the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and found himself come down with a bad migraine. Ian couldn’t wait to get out of class and go straight to bed, and probably sneak in a couple episodes of “Love Live! Sunshine!!”, like the degenerate. 
 
  But of course, it seems that nothing would go his way. It can never be that simple.
 
  As Ian descended the stairs of Planetary Hall, he found that menacing feeling climbing higher and higher, with each step towards the door straining him more and more, until he beheld a grisly sight. 
  
    Someone
  
   was there, in the Planetary Hall Eastern Vestibule…!
 
  “That chick from out in front of Ike’s… SHE’S BLOCKING THE EXIT OF PLANETARY!?”

  ] 
 
  She was certainly much more menacing up close, even though she had to be half of Ian’s size. (Ian was secretly afraid of short people.) He recognized what seemed to be a tattoo on her shoulder.
 
  “
  
    Oh-four-oh-one
  
  ” The girl spoke in a tinny voice that reminded Ian of creaking metal. 
 
  “
  Ian!
  ”
 
  “How th’FUCK do you know my name?”
 
  “
  I know a lot about you, but that isn’t important right now. I’m here on a … business offer, yes, let’s call it that.
  ”, said the stranger.
 
  “Eh? Business? Well then, why don’cha go over to Enterprise Hall! They 
  
    love
  
   business, and business accessories!”
 
  “
  Ah, but that’s the thing, good sir. My business tonight… concerns you!
  ” 
 
  Something was up with the whole situation. Was it because the stranger’s head was a bit too disproportionately big? Were her eyes too large for her face? Her cheery smile seemingly hid a thousand secrets behind it, and the twin drills on her head more so resembled steel than human hair. Maybe, just maybe, it was because Ian felt that it was an appropriate response to respond to her offer with
 
  “Watanabe?”
 
  “
  Ueh?
  ”, replied the stranger, dumbfounded by Ian’s brainlessness.
 
  “You Watanabe. Have you heard of her? Aquors?”
 
  “
  I don’t… know… what you’re talking about.
  ”
 
  “I know… that you don’t know…”, said Ian, trying to be like the one of the characters in JoJo’s (and failing to do so), “But what you don’t know that you don’t know,...” 
 
  “
  I’m not here to play silly games, boy. That isn’t gonna work out too well for ya…
  ”
 
  “Is 
  NIGERUNDAYO!!
  ”, Ian cried, knocking over the stranger, bolting out of the double doors like a bat out of hell! 
 
  “
  Well then. Running away, what an act of cowardice! Maybe Hatsune was right about Ian, a rare accomplishment for her, to be sure. Ah, but he’s bound to tucker out eventually...
  ”

  For someone as fat as he was, Ian was a surprisingly good runner. Of course, this was only when his life depended on it (a behavior typical of most humans). 
 
  He Naruto ran east behind the Johnson Center, the bustling heart of the George Mason campus. Ian dared not look behind him, for surely, his pursuer was right behind him at all times!

   

  Ian made his way into the music building, de Laski Hall, via one of the lower floor exits. He practically threw himself into the elevator and mashed the button to the top floor like an osu! player. To his dismay, the certain someone was already at the top floor, waiting for him. Ian mashed the “close door” button, followed by the ground floor button. Waiting at the bottom for him, again, was the twin drilled stranger. How did she get down here so quickly?
 
  “
  Ya do realize if I was trying to murder you, I would’ve done so already by now?
  ”, she said.
 
  Ian stepped out of the elevator.
 
  “No.”, he replied. Ian fumbled for something in his pants pocket, but the stranger didn’t seem to notice. Or care. 
 
  “
  Well. Now ya do. Now, back to what I was gonna say earlier, there’s-
  ”
   
 
  “PSYCH!” Ian pulled out a multitool, and rammed the knife part into the stranger’s eye! It made a strange “pink!” sound, as Ian grabbed her by the ahoge and 
  
    yeeted
  
   her down the hallway, much to a passerby student’s dismay.
 
  “Bahahahaha!”, Ian chuckled, getting into the next elevator, back to the top.
 
  “
  Aaand just when it was starting to go well…
  ”, she said, picking herself up. The other student looked at the stranger with a look of terror on her face… 
 
  “
  
    Are… are you okay?
  
  ”
 
  “
  It’s none of your goddamn business!~
  ”, said the stranger all too cheerily.

  
  

  Ian bolted out of the building, the stranger no doubt on his tail. Sure enough, as Ian turned back, she was! And she was 
  
    pissed
  
  ! So much so, in fact, that the long, pink ribbon on her dress unfurled into a tail of sorts, ending a brazen ring. Deep magenta, bat-like wings also sprouted from her back. Clearly, she wasn’t human. There’d be no outrunning her on foot… 
 
  “(On foot...)”, thought Ian, realizing a student in the circle outside booking a LIME scooter with an app. As soon as he stepped on, Ian kicked him off!
 
  “
  
    hey what the hell man”
  
 
  “PSSSH! Nothing personnel, kiddo!!”, Ian said, revving the e-scooter and speeding off, as the now-winged stranger followed right behind him. 
 
  Ian scooted past the Mason statue, accidentally running over the plaque. Any Mason Patriot worth their salt knew that that meant four years of bad luck, but the thought didn’t occur to Ian at the moment.
 
  He burst through the northeast double doors of the Johnson Center, scooting in and out of tables filled with people socializing and/or “enjoying” food from the various fast food restaurants in the food court, all the while as Ian was being pursued. The patrons seemed to be more upset than anything, as Ian recalled that no one in NoVA really gave a shit about this sort of insanity. Just last week, there had been a student roaming campus wearing nothing but a cardboard box.
 
  Ian revved the scooter once more as he drifted around the information kiosk (the workers there looked as uninterested and dead inside as ever), as his pursuer smacked into a pillar! Now was his chance to escape! 
 
  He sped out of the second set out double doors, into the J.C. East Vestibule. He turned to see his pursuer losing distance, to which, Ian triumphantly cried out!
 
  “Bahahahaha! Nothing bad, ever happens to m-” Ian should’ve watched where he was going. He 
  
    really
  
   should have, as before him, lay the long flights of stairs in between David King Hall and the Planetary/Exploratory duplex, the bane of students wanting to get from The HUB to Johnson. 
 
  The scooter got a good 2 seconds of airtime, before sinking like a rock! 

  “UUUUUUUYEEEEEEE!!!”, Ian cried out, tumbling his way down over fifty feet of stairs. Thankfully, there wasn’t anyone else around to laugh at him this time. Ian came to a rather uncomfortable rest at the bottom of the stairs, landing with a resounding “Damt.” 
 
  “Did I fucken’ break my ankle ‘r somethin’? God damn, how’m I gonna pay for 
  
    that!?
  
  ”
 
  Just when he was about to come to the terms of his crash landing, he heard a voice come from behind him.
 
  “
  Like I said, that isn’t going to work, buddy. Ya took quite the fall there! Are you well? Do you have brain damage?
  ”

  ] 
 
  “uhhh, no. But more importantly, 
  
    who th’FUCK’re you
  
  ?”
 
  The Utauloid was taken aback by Ian’s inquiry.
 
  “
  You kidding me? It says, 
  
    right here
  
   --
  ” tapping on her left forearm, “
  
    Tay! Toh! Tee! Ka-sah-
  
  
    nay!
  
  
    ” 
  
 
  So this stranger was Teto. From Vocaloid. That couldn’t be right, because as far as Ian knew, the characters weren’t real.
 
  “That must be some really dedicated cosplay…”, he said.
 
  “
  This ain’t
  
     cosplay,
  
   bub
  
    !
  
  
    ”
  
 “Okay, uhhh, so what’s the ‘T’ stand for…? and more importantly, why do you want to see me so badly…?” 
  Teto’s expression perked up, and a smug grin was spreading across her. Things were going to get interesting.
 
  “
  The ‘T’ means ‘trustworthy’, and a little, uh, 
  
    birdie
  
  , told me that you’ve got a problem with one Ms. Michelle
  
     COOL IT!!!
  
  ?
  ”
 
  “How… so…?”, Ian replied, slightly worried about Teto’s inquisition.
 
  Teto pulled out a notepad from one of her shirt pockets and poured over something.
 
  “
  Let’s see here, ah… Oh, did she kinkshame you?
  ”, Teto asked flatly.
 
  “Oh, yeah, while ago, but I don’t know if what she said even matters. We’ve been best friends for about three and a half years now, and I’d 
  
    never
  
   want to do anything to hurt her, if that’s what you’re implying, 
  
    Kassa-nay
  
  !”
 
  “
  You didn’t let me finish! There’s 
  
    one
  
   thing the two of us, you and I, have in common…
  ”
 
  “And what in God’s Name would that be…?” 
 
  “
  
    We both enjoy making her suffer~!
  
  ” Ian could’ve sworn the strange ...thing’s eyes were glowing a shade of magenta.
 
  “I think ‘suffer’ is a bit of a 
  
    strong
  
   term for intentionally bringing the same flavor of chips that she hates and replying to everything with 
  
    Jojo’s
  
   GIFs…”
 
  “
  It’s ‘GIF’.
  ”
 
  “Bah, who cares.”, said Ian gruffly. Teto pressed further.
 
  “
  But surely, there’s 
  
    something
  
   you hate about Michelle? That you want to get back at her for?
  ”
 
  Ian sat down and thought hard for a moment.
 
  “She keeps calling me a ‘Boomer’ because I don’t know what Poptropica is. I don’t get it! I’m only two years older than her! How does that even work!?”
 
  Teto gasped and rubbed her hands on the side of her face.
 “Oh! OH! Been there, done that! Same here, buddy! Now try being twice her age.” 
  Ian was confounded by Teto’s revelation.
 
  “How am I gonna be thirty-two?”
 
  “
  I didn’t mean it like that, moron.
  ”, she said flatly.
 
  “yer thirty-two.”
 
  “
  Thirty-one.
  ”
 
  Ian turned about halfway around and said to no one, in particular: 
 
  “
  
    I guess it really is true what they say about lolis, they -”
  
 
  “
  who the fuck are you talking to
  ”
 
  Without a second of hesitation, Ian said, “The audience.” 
 
  “Aw, damt, ya made me forget where I was gonna go with that! Some help you are, Kassa-nay!”
 
  “
  Agh,
  
     the point is
  
  , we could 
  
    work together
  
   to 
  
    get Mee-chelle
  
   what’s 
  
    coming to her!
  
  ”
 
  “YOU’RE GOING TO BEAT HER UP?”
 
  “
  Maybe!
  ” Teto winked.
 
  “NO! That’s terrible! And how would you even get away with that, she’s gay, that’s probably considered a hate crime!”
 
  “
  Because I’m maaagic~!
  ”
 
  “
  
    Magic?!
  
  ” Ian was livid.
 
  It seemed that Ian had only blinked, and Teto had disappeared around the corner of Exploratory. Ian limped over to the other corner. 
 
  “
  
    Ooo, how’d I do that?
  
  
    ”
  
 
  There was a metallic clinking sound accompanied by a small flash of pinkish light. Some kind of lance had appeared in Teto’s hand!
 
  “
  
    Ooo, where’d that come from?
  
  
    ”
  
 
  “
  
    I don’t think I get it…
  
  ”, said Ian wearily.
 
  “
  But you haven’t seen the best part yet!
  ”
 
  “And what would that be?”, an exasperated Ian bemoaned.
 
  Teto’s smugness was approaching dangerous levels. She pointed to her own head. For lack of a better explanation, the “drills” on the side of her head switched on, pointing forwards now and spinning like actual drills. As if that wasn’t bad enough, the same wings and “tail” from the chase had appeared alongside them.
 
  “How’s that even possible?”, said Ian. 
 
  “
  And this is how we’ll get Michelle!
  ”
 
  “No seriously, how is that even physically possible, d’ya put the wings under yer shirt or somethin’-”
 
  “
  Still not convinced? I get it. You’re hard to get to. 
  
    Did you want something in return?
  
  ”
 
  “whaddya mean”
 
   The Utauloid’s eyes narrowed.
 
  “
  
    You’re a dirty weeb, aren’t you?
  
  ”
 
  “Teto, I, I really don’t think--”
 
  “
  Oh. 
  
    What’s this then?
  
  ”, she said, grabbing and unzipping Ian’s bag.
 
  “TETO, I REALLY DON’T --”
 “Wow. Eli? From Rabu Raibu?! Your waifu, in your bag!?” She pulled out Ian’s nesoberi, bought from a convention on-campus last fall, all for the low, low price of $33. For whatever reason, Ian had cut the tag off.  
  “Teto. Please put that back.” Ian’s face was beet-red.
 
  “
  Look at that~, you’re embarrassed! Serves you right for having shit taste! We all know Nico is best girl! But… What if I told you I could do you one better?
  ”
 
  “
  
    What the hell does that mean?!
  
  ”
 
  Teto stopped dead in front of Ian, holding the plushie in her arms.
 
  “
  
    Three. Dee. Eli.
  
  ”
 
  Even though she was barely half the size of Ian, he still felt deeply unnerved by this inhuman… thing offering to perform some kind of magic trick. Was this to be trusted?
 
  “I 
  
    really
  
   don’t like where this is going.”, said.
 
  “
  If you turn around for a few minutes, I think you will~
  ”
 
  “Why.”, a rather concerned Ian spat, with his folded together in a pretzel manner.
 
  “
  Just do it.
  ”, the UTAU asserted.
 
  “okay, fine”
 
  Ian heard Teto set the nesoberi down onto the asphalt. That was the 
  
    only
  
   normal sound. Following up that was a cacophony of mechanical grinding and organic squelching, as well as several other things Ian didn’t know and didn’t 
  
    want
  
   to know. 
 
  “can I turn around yet”
 
  “
  no~
  ”
 
  Ian decided to take a peek anyways.
 
  Teto was knelt over the nesoberi. Somehow, one of Teto’s Drills had detached from her head at one point, and was now burrowing into the nesoberi’s back. Magenta-colored liquid was pouring from Teto’s right hand into the drill, presumably entering Eli and doing… something.
 
  “
  I SAID NO!
  ”
 
  “okay, okay…” Ian waved off his hand at whatever Teto was getting up to.
 
  “
  Aaand, uh…
  ” Something clicked. Sky-blue light blasted from somewhere.
 
  “
  
    Swiggity Sw-eal~
  
 
  
    Ur waifu IS REAL 
  
 
  
    The contract has now been signed,
  
 
  
    So you should know the deal...
  
  ”
 
  “Teto, I didn’t sign anything, what the fuck does that mean?”
 
  “
  You can turn around now, Ian.
  ”
 
  “
  Хорошо...
  ”, said a familiar-sounding voice.
 
  The scene could only be described as nonsensical. Now, there were 
  
    two
  
   anime characters in front of him, although at the very least Ian knew who the second one was.

  “
  
    Mmmh…
  
  ” Eli Ayase, Otonokizaka Girls’ High Student Council President and Ninth Muse, sat up.
 
  “
  You REALLY owe me one after this.
  ”
 
  “ 
  ...そして、あなたは「イアン」になれますか？
  ” Ian had no idea what she was saying. Turns out that real life doesn’t have subtitles!
 
  “
  Oh, shoot, she’s still in 
  
    subbed mode...
  
  ”
 
  Teto giddily pierced the now-talking nesoberi in the back, before reattaching the drill to her own head. The wings and ribbon-tail had both retracted by now.
 
  “
  Ack!
  ”, cried out Eli
 
  “
  There we go. Now she’s speaking American!
  ” “That’s not a language.” “
  But American English is!
  ” “
  But who are you?
  ” Eli was pointing at Teto. Teto seemed worried about something, but immediately shrugged it off.

  “
  Let’s get started with the introductions, then!
  ”
 
  “
  Ian, Eli. Eli, Ian. Teto, Eli. Eli, Teto. GREAT. We’ve got that all down, coming along nicely!
  ”, said Teto ecstatically. 
 
  Teto leaned forwards. Ian still felt intimidated. “
  
    Now kiss.~
  
  ”, said Teto.
 
  The two “lovers” seemed extremely uncomfortable and were both staring at Teto. Ian’s dreadful feeling returned in full force.
 
  “Don’t we have to go on a date first?”, said Ian.
 
  “
  
    oh, what the hell do 
  
  you
  
     know about relationships
  
  ”, Teto dismissed.
 
  “You don’t go to first base with someone you immediately met! That’s cringe!”
 “You didn’t ‘just meet’ Eli! You watched Love!Live!, isn’t that enough about her?” 
  Ian reacted with dumbfoundment. “No!”
 
  “
  Ian. I’m not sure if 
  
    this
  
   could even work, considering that I am
  
    ,
  
   wholeheartedly,
  
     without a doubt, 
  
  
    g-
  
  ”
 
  Teto pressed her lance up against Eli’s throat. 
 
  “
  
    What was that, punk?
  
  ” “
  ...
  ” The color drained out of Eli’s face.
 
  “
  You gonna finish that sentence, tankie?
  ”
 
  Eli shuddered as Teto pressed the lance further.
 
  “
  
    Гавно…
  
  ”, muttered Eli.
 
  Something formed around Eli’s hand. Ian knew something wasn’t right here. She turned to Ian, and shouted
 
  “
  RUN!
  ” Well, he sure knew how to do that.

  “YEET!”, he yelled!
 Ian had thrown his shoe further up the road, towards a building called “The Hub”. Ian booked it back around the corner of Exploratory, running into the ground floor.. In the commotion, he had dropped his backpack. He made it down the hall before turning into the bathroom and slammed himself into the nearest open stall. The stall door closed with a hearty “*THUNK*”. 
  “Finally, a few minutes to rest”, Ian thought to himself. “
  
    But why’d I have to do that on a banged-up ankle?!
  
  ” He tried not to cry, and failed!
 
  Meanwhile, an icicle well over a foot long, materialized and immediately shot towards Teto, striking her clear in the collarbone.

  “
  
    AH, SHET!
  
   Now he’s run off somewhere! Look what you did!

  “
  
    I did
  
  ? 
  
    You’re
  
   the one who oh-so wanted to stab me!
  ”
 
  “
  YOU WERE GONNA RUIN EVERYTHING! THE WHOLE GODDAMN MASTER PLAN!
  ” Teto was practically screeching. “
  
    Not like it would’ve even hurt me.
  
  
    ”
  
 
  “
  Иди на хуй
  
    , h
  
  
    ow does me being gay ruin it!?
  
  ”
 
  “
  Just play along with the ‘
  
    g.f.
  
  ’ spiel.
  ”
 
  “
  WHY?
  ”, cried Eli. 
 
  “
  Don’t you want to enjoy your newfound sentience? You owe me one, too! Bigtime!!
  ” Teto seemed desperate.
 
  Eli threw up her hands. “
  Would you be so kind as to care to explain 
  
    how
  
  ?
  ”
   
 
  Teto appeared to be angered, but she didn’t enter her “second form”.
 
  “
  
    I brought you into this world, and I can sure as hell take you out of it.
  
  ”
  
     
  
 
  “
  
    NO THANKS, I LIKE SENTIENCE
  
  ”, Eli blurted out. Clearly, this was the second worst thing to ever happen to Eli Ayase in any timeline, right behind Nagphir the Great.
 “Ah, now that’s more like it.”, said Teto. “Do you have any idea where he could have gone off too?” 
  “
  His room. Wilson Hall.
  ” 
 
  Teto fiddled with something on -- or rather, in -- her cuff.
 
  “
  
    Wil-son Hall, Gee Emm Yoo,
  
   VAAAH. Ah. There we go.
  ”
 
  “
  What are you doing?
  ”
 
  “
  Opening a Door there.
  ”, said Teto nonchalantly.
 
  “
  What? There’s only one door in Ian’s room!
  ”
 
  With a press of a button in her cuff, A hexagonal portal appeared a few dozen feet behind Teto.
 
  “
  Not 
  
    that
  
   kind of door. Now hurry up and get in, before someone calls the campus cops on us! We can talk and make up later!
  ”
 
  “
  Well…
  ”
 
  “
  Are ya gonna come with?
  ” Eli said nothing.
 
  “
  Ah, that’s fair, I can just get another one of you off of Amazon or something, maybe even one more obedient! Not like Ian’d ever tell the difference…!
  ”
 
  “
  I’ll do it…
  ”
 
  After a few minutes, Ian got out of the bathroom stall he was hiding in. Ian creeped down the basement hallway of Exploratory. At this hour, most of the campus was practically a ghost town.

   

  “Let’s hope throwing the shoe in the wrong direction worked.”
 
  “Ooo-kay. They’re gone. For now. And probably looking for me. Huuuuuuuuoooooooooh…” Ian casually remembered that he had banged up his ankle in the scooter crash.
 
  “I… guess I’d better head home for the night, because 
  
    that
  
  ”, he said gesturing to the spot where he had landed from his spill, “is certainly enough crazy for one day. Hol up, where’d my backpack go?”
 
  “Ehnnnh, whatever. I must’ve dropped it back up the stairs.” He didn’t bother to go and get it, knowing it had probably been stolen and sold on Craigslist by now
 
  As Ian limped home, he noticed that the dreadful feeling from earlier wasn’t as strong. Maybe that Teto thing was finally leaving him alone. But where could Eli have gone, did Teto take Eli with her?
 
  “Did… I leave my lights on?... Must’ve, it’s been a really long day. Good thing I don’t have to pay the power bill here, eh heh heh…” Ian chuckled to himself as he climbed the stairs. 
 
  “Wait. My door’s… unlocked. I locked it before I left for class. I 
  
    always
  
   lock it before class…” Ian thought to himself, turning the knob. It couldn’t have been a roommate, since Ian had lived alone in the dorm… at least, until today.
 
  Ian could never have possibly mentally prepared himself for what he would witness next. Inside, Eli, the 
  
    real
  
   Eli, was sitting on the edge of the other bed, eating dark chocolate Hershey’s. Next to her on the bed was Teto Kasane, seemingly 
  
    not
  
   the drill-demon she was fifteen minutes ago. Both of them were staring at him.
 
  “
  Oh, hey, I was wondering when you’d come back. Ya dropped your backpack, dumbass.
  ”, Teto said, gesturing to Ian’s backpack, now resting comfortably on the desk chair.
 
  The sound Ian made can only be described as a mixture between Marx Soul’s Death Cry and Charles “Cr1t1kal” White when he sees a cockroach. 
 
  “
  
    UUUUUUUUWAAAAAAAAAAAIEEEEEEEEE”
  
  . 
 
  The nightmare of his was only about to begin.
 
  Ian promptly fainted. 
 
  
    THUD
  
  .
 
  “
  ...
   ”
 
  “
  Can you go pick him up?
  ”, said Teto.

  Sunlight was pouring in through the window.
 
  “Ugh, my head… Some weird dream 
  
    I 
  
  had…”, mumbled Ian. “With, uh, Eli. I think she was there? And, uh, Teto what’s-er-name. Huh. Why does my ankle hurt?”
 
  “
  That’s because it wasn’t a dream, idiot.
  ” A plot twist no one saw coming, indeed!
 
  Ian’s gaze turned towards the day bed. Eli was there, albeit in a different outfit than last night. One could compare the noise that escaped from Ian’s mouth to Finn from 
  
    Adventure Time
  
   screaming.
 
  “AAAAAAAAAAÆ.”, followed by “Why are you real?” was the only thing that Ian could muster to say.
 
  “
  Teto, … made me real? I guess?
  ”, said Eli.
 
  “Yeah okay.”, Ian succinctly replied.
 
  “
  You seem oddly okay with this.
  ”
 
  “I’m still dreaming, aren’t I?” 
 
  “
  If you’re dreaming, why is your ankle still hurt?
  ”
 
  Ian pulled up his sweatpants. Sure enough, the lower half of his left leg was still bruised from his fall. Another screech resounded through the room.
 
  “Uh, if you don’t mind me asking, do… do you…”
 
  “
  Do I what?
  ”
 
  “Do you share your memories with the ‘Real’ Eli Ayase? This is for, uh, research purposes.”
 
  “
  I have no idea what you’re talking about, but… I suppose in a way, yes. I have memories ‘from the show’, and then everything I’ve seen after you bought me at that convention…. 
  
    much to my dismay...
  
  ”
 
  “Wait. You, you were alive, the whole time? And you ‘
  
    saw everything?
  
  ’”, Ian was astounded. 
 
  “YOU WERE CONSCIOUS THE WHOLE TIME, AND YOU SAW EVERYTHING?”, Ian yelled.
 
  “
  Yes.
  ”
 
  “Even the thing with the kazoo?”
 
  “
  Especially the thing with the kazoo.
  ”
 
  “Oh no.”
 
  “
  How does one even manage to do 
  
    that
  
  , anyways? In front of your friends no, less?
  ”

  Conveniently, Teto burst out from underneath Ian’s bed before the conversation could get any more awkward.. 
 
  “
  Ah, good to see you’re finally up. Lucky you don’t have any classes today, it’s already 10:30!
  ”, said the Utau.
 
  “That’s gotta be a new record for me. Also, 
  
    why are you under my bed
  
  ?
 
  “
  Oh, there’s a Gate under there.”
 
  “A WHAT?” Ian rolled himself over the bed, firmly landing on the floor. He peeked under the bed by where Teto was lying, but couldn’t see anything.
 
  “what the fuck do you MEAN?”, said Ian
 
  “
  Oh. You know.
  ”
 
  “No. I don’t. How long has that been there, anyways?”
 
  “
  About half an hour after you passed out. Anyways, you'd better get yourself up and attem, we’re supposed to meet up with Neru and Haku today.
  ”
 
  “Wait, wait, wait. There are 
  
    more
  
   of you fuckers?”
 
  “
  Well, yeah. You remember 
  
    Triple Baka
  
  ? The yellow character?
  ”
 
  “Maaaaaybe?”
 
  “
  Ugh, Then, uh… I think 
  
    Rin 
  
  tends to call her ‘Piss Miku’ for some reason?
  ”
 
  “
  Rin? As, in Hoshizora?
  ”, said Eli.
 
  “No, as in Kagamine.”, said Teto.
 
  “Ah. Piss Miku, I know that. Anyways, would you two, uh, mind?”, said Ian.
 
  “
  Mind what, exactly?
  ”, said Eli.
 
  “I’m supposed to get dressed here. With two girls staring at me.”
 
  “
  Oh, we can go home if you’d like!
  ”, said Teto.
 
  “whatchu mean”, Ian spat.
 
  Teto slid back under the bed, with no trace to be seen of her, dragging Eli with her.
 
  “
  Once you’re ready, just knock on the ground about here or so.
  ”, a muffled Teto said. 
 
  Ian hadn’t been up for twenty minutes yet, and he already had reached his daily limit of bullshit. Ian yanked the comforter off his bed. There was no “door” under there! There weren't any Tetoes or Elis either! What sort of quantum debauchery could be taking place here? 
 
  “Ah, Whatever.” , he figured. “I might as well go along with this. If Eli is real now, and is 
  
    apparently
  
   my girlfriend or something based off of what she said last night, I guess it’s okay. Not like I have a choice, lest I end up on the business end of those drills. ‘Personal offer’... what the hell do these assholes need me for, anyways?!”

   

  It was not exactly going to be okay. 
 
  Ian proceeded to go through his routine, showering and shaving and vitamins and all. He got dressed and did what Eli asked of him.
 
  “Uh, she said to knock, here, right?” Ian tapped the floor with his fist a few times.
 
  Suddenly, a bright light appeared under Ian’s bed where the wall should’ve been. Teto slid outwards and got up, followed by Eli soon after.
 
  “what… haaa?” Ian got a confused expression on his face, looking at the Utau like he had just been told that a kilogram of steel and a kilogram of feathers weigh the same.
 
  “
  Don’t worry about it.
  ”, said Teto.
 
  “Okay. But what I 
  
    am
  
   going to worry about is what the hell happened last night. Why are you here?”
 
  “
  We’ll talk about that with Neru.
  ”
 
  “Okay, but that still doesn’t answer what the hell happened, were you two fighting? Are you some kind of demon?” 
 
  Teto’s drills had turned on again, wings and ribbon-tail in tow.
 
  “
  If you’re referring to this, it’s because I’m 
  
    achually
  
   a 
  
    Chimaera
  
  , and-
  ”
 
  “So Teto is Monster Girl.”
 
  “
  Well, I don’t think so, but-

  “Uh oh.”
 
  “

  The two girls look at each other, and then at Ian. What was stranger, how he bass-boosted his own voice to absurdity, or how serious he was about what he was saying? Unlike Vocaloid, monster girls definitely weren’t real! But nevermind that. The three of them decided to get on with their day. After all, Ian felt had a very important meeting coming up…

  Ian, Teto, and Eli were walking on the northern end of the campus.
 
  “So what… exactly are we doin’? Some kinda magic-ass D’n’D quest thingy?”, said Ian.
 
  “
  I suppose you could say that.
  ”, said Teto.
 
  “What… we gotta kill somebody or somethin’?”
 
  “
  
    I suppose you could say that…
  
  ”
 
  “
  We have to kill someone?
  ”, said Eli.
 
  “
  Oh, no, no, no no… Not yet!~
  ”, chuckled Teto. “
  We’re going shopping!
  ”
 
  Ian interjected. 
 
  “Peh! Some quest!”
 
  “
  I can assure you, Ian, this is going to be 
  
    much more than that…
  
   Your goal is Books-a-Million!
  ”
 
  “
  Why are we going to a bookstore
  ”, said Eli.
 
  “
  Ian knows.
  ”, said Teto.
 
  “No I fucken’ don’t.”, said Ian.
 
  “
  Well. You will.
  ”
 
  “Okay, but the nearest Books-A-Million t’here is all the way down at Potomac Mills. I don’t have a car, how are we gonna get there? Are we getting on the bus stop up here?”
 
  Teto stopped and turned around. She looked at Ian.
 
  “
  I dunno man, that seems like a you problem.
  ”, said Teto.
 
  “whatchu me-”
 
  Teto had grabbed Eli’s hand, and the two of them disappeared. 
 
  “oH COME ON!!”, Ian cried out.
 
  What kind of power did these “Vocaloids” even have, and why are they so insufferably abusing it?

  
  

  11:50 A.M.
 
  “Jayzus Kraist, that took too long to figure out.”, said Ian.
 
  Ian stepped off the bus and proceeded towards the mall. 
 
  “Shouldn’t take too long t’find ‘em once I’m in there. It ain’t everyday you go and see a fuckin’ 
  
    anime waifu
  
   runnin’ around. Pffft. Didn’t Teto say we were meeting with somebody named “Neru”? The “Piss Miku” Rio keeps freakin’ out about in the groupchat. Wonder what she looks like. Eh, if she’s another one of these ‘Vocaloids’ I think I’ll know her when I see her.” Ian said to himself, walking down the parking lot.
 
  “Problem is, what th’ 
  
    FUCK
  
   is a ‘Neru’?”

  “
  That would be me.
  ”, said … well, Neru. Neru Akita. Goldenrod hair, goldenrod eyes, goldenrod tie on some kind of strange dress/suit combination… and same cuff-things and bug-eyes Teto had. Hoo boy. 
 
  Ian shouted admittedly louder than he should have. What kind of first impression was this?
 
  “How did you find me?”, he cried.
 
  “
  Teto was going 
  
    on and on
  
   about how you had to take ‘the bus’ here, ‘like some kind of mortal pleb’. RODOLFO, she never shuts up…!Some nerve she has, she can 
  
    easily
  
   jump both of you here… Ugh, I’m sorry you had to deal with 
  
    her
  
   first.
  ”
 
  “Is there some sort of beef between you two? You two and, uh, 
  
    Miku
  
  , looked pretty cordial in Triple Baka-”
 
  Ian didn’t realize that while he was talking, he and Neru had appeared on the other side of the mall. 
 
  “What the fuck. What the fuck!”
 
  Teto and Eli were sitting on a bench in front of them.
 
  “
  Hi.
  ”, said Eli. “
  Took you long enough to get here.
  ”, said Teto.
 
  “Okay? Okay. But why are we here, exactly? What do we benefit out of this?”
 
  “
  You said something about it last night after you blacked out. Something about ‘Monster Girl Encyclopedia’ and a ‘Bam store’ at ‘Potomac Mills’. Is this ‘Encyclopedia’ thing important to you? 
  
    Maybe it turns you on…?
  
  ”
 
  The color drained from Ian’s face.
 
  “Okay, first of all, why the fuck were you watchin’ me sleep!? Second of all, -”
 
  Eli interrupted.

  “
  It was me, actually. I was tidying up, 
  
    since, after all, this was the first time I could actually do something about your disaster zone of a room,
  
   and you started mumbling. You said that you had to ‘Get the Monster Girl Encyclopedia at the BAM’ and that ‘The book is the first step in my plan to defeat Miku.’ Why don;t you explain what 
  
    that 
  
  is supposed to mean?
  ”
 
  Ian wasn’t sure whether to be complimented or offended by that. 
 
  “Uh, shoot… Oh, yeah, last time I was here I saw literal hentai at the Books-a-Million or “the BAM” or whatever the hell they’ve rebranded themselves as now.  About ‘Defeating Miku’, Uh, I think that’s part of some little inside joke me and a friend of mine, Michelle, have. I think last November or something, I-”
 
  “
  Did you say ‘Michelle’? Michelle Magdalen COOL IT!!!?
  ”,  said Neru.
 
  “I’m not sure how you know her last name or her middle name, but yes, that would be the bitch.”, said Ian
 
  “
  That ‘little ‘inside joke’ is real.
  ”, said Teto, before turning to Neru and saying “
  
    Why the fuck did she tell this guy?
  
  ” Neru shrugged.
 
  Ian slowly turned to Teto with a dire expression on his face. 
 
  “What do you mean, ‘that inside joke is real’? Are you 
  
    seriously
  
   implying that Michelle Magdalen COOL IT!!!, from my German class two years ago, is actually 
  
    the
  
   Hatsune Miku, from Vocaloid 2.0, reincarnated from God-knows-where, and is here, on planet Earth, to gain viewers and followers so she can become intergalactically and eternally popular?” 
 
  “
  Yes.
  ”, said Teto in a Chad Voice™.
 
  Ian’s expression soured. With the craziness he had experienced last night and this morning, it seems that all of this inanity was only just beginning.
 
  “So then, why, why are you coming to 
  
    me
  
   about this? Am I supposed to kill her? Kill my friend over some shitty meme?”, he sneered.
 
  “
  Yeah.
  ”, said a fifth person.
 
  “...”
 
  “And I assume you’d be this ‘Haku’?”, said Ian sarcastically.
 
  Haku Yowane had appeared during the conversation, nondescript bottle in hand. It reeked of booze. Haku vaguely resembled Neru, albeit with whitish hair, and indigo tie, and red eyes. And bags under said eyes. Were these two related?
 
  “
  Yup.
  ”, replied Haku, swigging whatever was in the bottle.
 
  Ian’s expression soured as Haku took a swig. His sarcasm fell of deaf ears… Oh, wait. Those three didn’t have ears, just some squarish… devices? Maybe those were their species’ version of ears. Regardless, Ian had bigger problems right now. Such as Teto.
 
  “So now there’s 
  
    four
  
   of you. That still doesn’t explain why you all want 
  
    me
  
   to help you.”, said Ian.
 
  “
  We can talk later. 
  
    Now
  
  , it seems we gotta find that ‘book’ of yours that you oh so need…
  ”, said Neru.
 
  “
  Can we get lunch first?
  ”
 
  “
  ... sure.

  The rather dysfunctional quintet proceeded inside the mall.
 
  However, someone else had taken notice of this motley crew. One Meiko Sakine just-so-happened to be in town that day, looking for ceramic animals. No one really knows why she likes them so much, or why she hides them around her own house. It’s not important, really, but what is important that Meiko decided to take her findings back to her friend and manager…
 
  None other than 
  
    the
  
   Miku Hatsune, CEO of Domino’s Pizza, Minecraft, and Yamaha…
 
  (She’s also the #1 Melia Antiqua Stan, but let’s save that for another time.)

  
  

  “
  I’m… not hungry right now, so, uh, you all can just have fun running around in the food court like nincompoops.
  ”, said Neru.
 
  The group responded with a simultaneous and resounding “k.”

  “aight I’m going to Burger King, you guys want anything?”, said Ian.
 
  “
  nah.
  ”, said Haku.
 
  “
  If we’re gonna subject ourselves to 
  
    mall food
  
  , I might as well head to the Popeye’s over there and get that chicken sandwich everyone’s raving about…
  ”, boasted Teto. 
 
  “
  yeah cool
  ”, said Haku uncaringly.
 
  “I’d go too, but that line is somethin’ else. Stretches out the door, even.”, said Ian.
 
  Ian noticed Haku was still holding the nondescript bottle. 
 
  “Should you really be carrying that around in here?”
 
  “
  It’s NoVA, it’s not like anyone’s gonna notice. Or care.
  ”, Haku said nonchalantly.
 
  “Fair enough. Eli, you comin’ along?”, said Ian.
 
  “
  I guess… 
  ”, she replied.
 
  “We’ll meet you guys back here once you’ve got your food.”

  “yeah you guys still got the chicken parm sandwich?”, Ian asked the underpaid, overworked employee.
 
  “
  
    No...
  
  ”, he replied soullessly. It was a well-known fact of life that all retail and foodservice employees were completely dead on the inside.
 
  “Alright, I’ll take the Whopper Jr. with uh, medium fries and a medium Diet Coke.”
 
  Ian turned around.
 
  “Whatchu want, Eli?”
 
  “
  Fries.
  ”, she sternly replied.
 
  “Anything else? Nothing to drink?”
 
  “
  NO DRINK. Only fries.
  ”
 
  “O-kay…”
 
  “Uh, add an extra order of large fries, then.”
 
  “Alright, your order is $

  ”, said the employee.
 
  “cool”
 
  Ian paid for their order like
  
     some kind of SIMP who doesn’t split the bill
  
   and sat down.
 
  “
  Ian.
  ”
 
  “Yea?”
 
  “
  Why is there only one fries here?
  ”
 
  Eli looked up rather defeatedly.
 
  “Whaddaya mean.”
 
  “
  
    There’s no small fries to go with my large fries.
  
  ”
 
  “Tee Are Gee?!?”, Ian squealed.
 
  “
  I don’t know what that is.
  ”

  Ian’s expression flattened out and he slumped in his seat. Now, he was as dead on the inside as the cashier.
 
  “The one normal thing that 
  
    would
  
   have happened today, with teleportation magic and evil Michelle and huntin’ down hentai, and it 
  
    doesn’t
  
  …!”
 
  “
  I’m sorry that you feel that way.
  ”
 
  “Jesus, look at that Popeye’s line. It’s been ten minutes and Teto and Haku haven’t even budged.”, said Ian.
 
  Neru approached the two.
 
  “
  When you two 
  
    lovebirds
  
   are done with your romantic dinner, you both head to the left from here. I’m going to look for Books-A-Million to the right from here. For whatever reason, the digital map kiosks aren’t working today, because clearly, nothing ever fucking works.
  ”
 
  With that, Neru power walked off in a huff.

  “Eli.” Ian had a grin and a blush on his face. “
  
    She called us ‘lovebirds’!
  
  ”
 
  Eli didn’t know what to make of that.
` “Does this mean,” Ian slowly rose out of his seat. “I’m on a date?” 
  Eli sighed. 

  “
  I guess so!
  ”, she said, absolutely dripping with sarcasm. Ian didn’t notice.
 
  Ian did his darndest to contain himself, but it was extremely obvious he was failing to do so.
 
  “Then we’ve got no time to lose. We gotta go search the left wing!!”, he said valiantly, attempting to impress his “date” and failing miserably to do so.
 
  Eli didn’t ask for any of this. She didn’t know why she had to say “boyfriend” after she woke up, but here they are now. Student Council President and Love Live 2010 Champion, and some nobody slob who somehow managed to meme his way into an interstellar conspiracy.

  “
  Miku. Miku, pick up the phone, please.
  ” Meiko Sakine frantically cried into the phone.
 
  “
  I’m in the middle of watching 
  
    Chrono Trigger: The Musical
  
   right now, this better be 
  
    fucking
  
   important, Meiko!

  “
  It’s Neru.

  “
  NANI!?
  ”
 
  “
  And Haku. And Teto. And two others.

  “
  This can’t be good. What do you mean by ‘two others’?
  ”
 
  “
  Some really 
  
    wide
  
   guy with blackish hair and this blonde chick. Judging by her vibes,  blondie is definitely 
  
    not
  
   natural in origin. No shoulder-ID visible either, so she’s gotta be recent. VERY RECENT. I’m at Potomac Mills right now to get… stuff, and I saw those five walk in.
  ”
 
  “
  How tall is he. How tall is the wide guy. Meiko, I need to know this.
  ”, said a very distressed Miku.
 
  “
  Judging from here, I’d say maybe 6’9”. … Ey, 
  
    nice.
  
  ”
 “No… IAN. IAN?! What could he possibly be doing with the Broke-a-loids? Nothing good, I presume. Keep an eye on them, we don’t know what shit Neru’s trying this time, and if she's working with Ian, oh ho ho ho ho ho… He might get us exposed. Some of his little ‘SLC’ slides are hitting way too close to comfort.”  
  “
  YOU LET HIM INTO SLC?!
  ”, yelled Meiko.
 
  “
  Originally, it was so Rin and I could make fun of him, but he drove everyone else off but me through the profane arts of Love Live Shiposting. Anyhoo, any incident involving both Ian and Neru would be way too risky for us. Keep an eye on them, try and find out what there up to.  I’d come up myself to help, but I gotta get back to the musical. This is the part where Frog shows up. My boy. I’m love him.
  ”
 “You got it. Meiko out.” Meiko hung up, mentally preparing for the task at hand.

  Ian and Eli pressed further into the mall’s left wing. The two came upon a kiosk with various sorts of devices.
 
  “‘Ello, sah! Would you like to try out some of the newest speakah’s from Beats by Dre™?” inquired the staffer, a rather burly fellow with a burlier moustache.
 
  “Uh, sure I’ll bite. How much is it?”, said Ian.
 
  “The dehmo is five minutes, sah. After that, you may purchase the Beats Pill™ Red™ MK-II for only fayve payments of $55.55.” Ian wondered how he pronounced the trademarks.
 
  “Five minutes you say? Well, I 
  
    certainly 
  
  know what song I’m playing, heh heh…”, Ian chuckled, glancing at Eli. With one, two, three taps on his phone, the demo speaker had been hooked up for the next five minutes.
 
  “
  I don’t like where this is going...
  ” Eli thought to herself.

  “
  Wait, is that…
  ” 
 
  The instrumental started up. It was the very song that The μ’s had written and performed for their championship, “Kira Kira Sensation.”
 
  “
  
    Oh, goddamnit.
  
  ”
 
  What happened next cannot be easily described with words. Despite being in the middle of the mall, Ian started dancing. Or at least, what can be approximately described as “dancing”. It didn’t resemble anything Eli remembered from her time in μ’s, that’s for sure. During the choruses, Ian started singing along, no less. Sure he got half the words wrong, was horribly off key, and his voice cracked everytime he sang “
  
    Ki-ra Ki-ra~
  
  ”, but that didn’t stop him. Neither did the fifteen or so people who stared as they walked by. And neither did Eli Ayase’s bewildered yet cringing expression.
 
  “
  
    Ah ha, it seems your good friend is quite tha fan of this,
  
  ” commented the vendor, as Ian resumed his headbanging with the next verse. 
 
  Eli should’ve very well been offended by this, this insolence that outclassed even Nico Yazawa. What was Ian even doing? Weren’t they here to find that “Monster Girl” Book? What even is a “Monster Girl”, and why did Ian need them to defeat this “Miku” person? Eli considered throwing an icicle at him to shut him up. But alas, she felt somewhat of the opposite way. Some way, somehow, Ian’s “dancing” was working. It was somehow endearing, in a strange sort of way, like a pug. Those things are objectively terrible, and their scrunched-up faces cause the dogs nothing but health problems and an early death, yet people all over the world still love those bastards. It was the same with Ian. … Wouldn’t that mean Eli would be led to an early death by Ian’s hands? 
 
  With a final, crackling, “
  
    Ki-ra Ki-ra
  
  ”, Ian took a bow. A few people even clapped, and Eli reconsidered her life choices. 
 
  “
  What the hell was that.
  ”, Eli bemoaned.
 
  “It slaps, Eli. 
  
    Kira Kira
  
  ’s probably their best song.” Ian said with a not-too-subtle wink. Ian turned to the vendor.
 
  “So do you have any models in orange? Red’s okay, but an orange speaker would just fit in better with the current vibes of my room, y’know.”, said Ian, impervious to the events that just transpired.
 
  “Sorry to tell you this, sah, but we’ve only red, white, black, and turquoise in stock today.”
 
  “Turquoise? Ehhh, I think I’ll pass here. Definitely going to look into this stuff online, and-”

  “
  Didn’t we have something we’re supposed to be looking for?
  ”, Eli interrupted.
 
  “Right, thank you for your time today!”, said Ian.
 
  “
  There’s a fork up ahead. Can you go to the left?
  ”
 
  “But what if I find the book? How am I gonna call y’all back?”
  
    
    
  

  “
  Don’t worry about it, I’m sure Teto, or Neru, or what’s-her-name will figure something out.
  ”, Eli said in a half-hearted tone.
 
  “aight, cya then” Ian darted off deeper into the corridor.
 
  Eli knew what she said was a lie. The only place that the path she was on was Sear’s. She just needed an excuse to excuse herself and internally recuperate. Eli didn’t want to be rude to Ian, she couldn’t bring herself to do that… somehow. It mildly irritated her. On the other hand, she honestly felt kind of worried. Wouldn’t someone like Ian get lost on his own?
 
  “
  
    (maybe, some people deserve to get lost
  
  )
  ”, she thought to herself as she went on her merry way.

  “Hmm. I could use some new shoes”, Ian thought to himself. “These one’s soles have kinda worn out.” He wandered into the nearest store that seemed like they’d have shoes. His phone went off.
 
  “
  Ian, I found the Books-A-Million, it’s all the way down the right wing.
  ” It was Neru.
 
  “Neru, how’d ya get my number?”, said Ian.
 
  “
  Don’t worry about it, just get over here so we can get your ‘book o’ monster waifus’ and get out!
  ”
 
  “Well, I can’t do that right now, cuz’ I’m in the middle of buyin’ some new shoes.”
 
  “
  Then hurry up with that and come over here.
  ”
 
  “I can’t find ‘em.”
 
  “
  What da ya mean, ‘you can’t find ‘em’?
  ”
 
  “I can’t find ‘em, there’s only soup here.”
 
  “
  What - what do you mean 
  
    there’s only soup
  
  ?
  ”
 
  “It means there’s only soup.”
 
  “
  Then get outta the soup aisle!
  ”
 
  “You don’t have to shout at me, 
  
    gawd
  
  …” A moment passed as Ian pressed onwards.
 
  “... there’s more soup here.”
 
  “
  
    Whaddaya mean there’s ‘more soup’?
  
  ”
 
  “There’s just more soup.”
 
  “
  GO INTO THE NEXT AISLE.
  ” Ian peeked around the corner, only to find more cans of soup.
 
  “... There’s still soup!”
 
  “
  WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?
  ” 
 
  “I’m at ‘Soup’.” 
 
  “
  WHADDAYA MEAN, YOU’RE ‘AT SOUP’?
  ”
 
  “I mean, I’m at Soup™”
 
  “
  
    WHAT STORE ARE YOU IN?!
  
  ”
 
  “I’M AT THE SOUP STORE!”
 
  “
  
    WHY ARE YOU BUYING CLOTHES AT THE SOUP STORE!?!
  
  ”
 
  “Fuck you!!”
 
  Ian smashed the hang-up button and grumbled. 

  “Time to walk across the entire goddamn mall. Heh, maybe Teto and Haku are outta line by now, it’s been over an hour.”

  
  

  This was simply not the case. As Ian passed the food court, he noticed two distinct figures in the line for Popeye’s -- one with magenta drills and one with a very long, silvery ponytail.
 
  “Pfft. Those must be Teto and Haku! Serves you right for falling for that ‘chicken sandwich’ trap!” Thankfully, they didn’t hear him talking shit, otherwise this would probably be the end of MikuLore.
 
  “Hm. I wonder where Eli went off to. Not like she could’ve gone far. Didn’t that ‘fork’  only lead into the Sear’s? Is she still there? Oh, whatever, I ought to go to the bookstore before Neru has a goddamned conniption.”

  “Hey, I’m back.”, said Ian.
 
  “
  Certainly took 
  
    you 
  
  long enough.
  ”, said a quite irked Neru.
 
  “I, ah, think I remember where the book was. Let’s go in. Wait, why didn’t you go in yourself? You could’ve found it by now, save us some time.”
 
  “I’d rather be 
  
    dead 
  
  than caught walking around with 
  
    monster girl porn!
  
  ”
 
  “Fair enough. Anyways, Teto and Haku are still in line at Popeye’s, and Eli’s off at, uh, the bathroom.”
 
  “
  The bathroom.
  ”
 
  “Yeah.”
 
  “
  Why is she in the bathroom, if she doesn’t have biological functions.
  ”
 
  Ian hesitated. 
 
  “Bitch, I don’t know that! She went to Sears, but I didn’t see her on my way back over. I dunno where else she would’ve gone off to.”
 
  “
  We are literally in an outlet mall. There are bucketloads of designer stores a basic bitch like her would go crazy for. I wouldn’t be surprised if she’s going on a shopping frenzy right now.
  ” 
 
  “Hey, don’t call Eli a bitch!” Simp. Thankfully, this simpery allowed Ian to notice a rather large and reddish-brown book was on the top shelf next to Ian’s shoulder.
 
  “Oh ho ho ho 
  
    ho
  
  , 
  
    what do we have here
  
  ?”, Ian asked rhetorically as he plucked The Monster Girl Encyclopedia off of the shelf.
 
  “
  how did you recognize it before even reading the title?
  ”
 
  “Oh, quit your worryin’! What matters is 
  
    I
  
  , uh, 
  
    we
  
   got it! I… have The Monster Girl Encyclopedia! Geh Hah Hah Hah HAH HAH HAH 
  
    HAH
  
  ! 
  
    That’s not a good evil laugh, I need to work on that.
  
  ” 
 
  “Just get to the checkout already! RODOLFO, how are you even going to live with yourself? Are you even going to be okay looking at the cashier?”
 
  “Oh, Neru. Neru, Neru A-kee-
  
    tah
  
  . I’m not going to be 
  
    okay
  
   with myself.” A twisted, sickly grin spread across Ian’s face, and Neru could’ve sworn that she saw, just for a moment, an orange glint in Ian’s eyes.
 
  “Cause I feel fantastic!”
 
  “
  Could you stop that shtick so we can go home.
  ” To that, Ian stopped his strange (at the very least, stranger than usual) behavior.
 
  “okay, fine… ”

  1:30 P.M.
 
  Ian had successfully acquired the centerpiece of his grand scheme. He and Neru now waited just outside the right entrance of the mall, by the And That!. Yes, the store is actually called “And That!”. Yes, there’s an exclamation point. No, I don’t know why. 
 
  “So when do you think Haku and Teto are finally gonna get their crap?”, said Ian.
 
  “
  About three mintues ago.
  ” It was Haku, 
 
  “Oh. So how’s the chicken sandwich? Is it worth the hype?”
 
  “
  
    NO!, and I’m never going there, or any other Popeye’s again!
  
  ”, Teto practically growled. 
 
  Ian refrained from pressing her for further details, partially out of fear for his own safety.
 
  “I got the book
  
    .
  
   So have any of you seen Eli? Last thing I heard from her is that she was headin’ to Sears.”
 
  “
  Nuh-uh. No sign of any school idols.”, said Haku.
 
  “Then shouldn’t we go back inside and look for her? I can’t leave her here!”
 
  “
  Fine, I 
  
    guess
  
   we can stay for a while longer. But just to get your girlfriend back! We aren’t doing anymore window shopping, especially at that damn soup store!
  ”, sneered Neru.
 
  Ian shamefully eyed his six cans of clam chowder. 
 
  “What’s wrong with soup?”, he said.
 
  “
  
    Several things…
  
  ”
 
  “Get a hold of yourselves. Let’s hurry up and do this.”
  , said Haku.
 
  The four proceeded back into the mall for one final sweep through.
 
  Meiko, on the other side of the median, was cramming her ceramic animals into the back of her Ford Fusion. (not sponsored) 
 
  “Ian’s friends… Why isn’t his girlfriend with him? Was the date 
  
    that
  
   bad? RODOLFO, it’d seem so! Nonetheless, this can’t be good. I don’t like the vibes of that creepy book he was holding either… Looks like I won’t be going home yet.”
 
  Little did she know that she wouldn’t be going home today, or anytime soon for that matter.

  At this hour, the mall was a bit more packed than it was earlier. But it was easy to spot Eli. Not because of her charm, sharp style, or the fact that she was literally an anime character. No, Eli was struggling to carry nine different bags, all from various designer stores. For whatever reason, she was wearing a fedora, too.
 
  “
  Oh, RODOLFO, Eli, how much crap did you even get?
  ”, barked Neru.
 
  “WHY DID YOU GO ON REDDIT?!”, cried out Ian.
 
  “
  Uhh… хахахахаха...
  ” Eli nervously laughed, as Teto snickered.
   “How did you even pay for this stuff, anyways?” 
  Eli began to grow nervous.
 
  “
  Well, I , ah -
  ”
 
  “
  You know what? I don’t even want to hear it. Just get back outside and we’ll jump back to Ian’s building.
  ”, said Neru.
 
  The reunited quintet left the mall for the last time that day, but it seems they weren’t going home quite yet.
 
  “Oi, Neru. Who’s that.”, said Ian.
 
  “
  Who’s what?
  ”
 
  “Oh, you know, the brown-haired chick that’s been following us for the past ten minutes.”
 
  The five turned around. 
 
  “
  Why didn’t you mention this sooner?
  ”
 
  The brown-haired girl seemed frightened.

  “Hey, you look kinda familiar. Did we go to high school together or something?”, said Ian.
 
  “
  Midlothian High School, yes. But you wouldn’t know me. 
  
    Our
  
   friend Michelle, on the other hand…
  ”, said the stranger.
 
  “Oh, so you must be one of those people from Esellsy! Great to finally meet you, uh, …”
 
  “
  Meiko.
  ” Neru, Haku, and Teto tensed up at this revelation.
 
  “Meiko, ah. Hey, why are y’all lookin’ at me funny? Ain’t she supposed to be friendly or somethin’?” Ian narrowed his eyes. The tattoo on her shoulder didn’t seem too friendly. “(‘CV-05’?), what does that even mean?”, Ian thought to himself.
 
  “Wait. On Esellsy, there weren't any ‘Meiko’es on the sharin’ list. What do you mean, ‘Michelle’s Friend’? And what are you doing all the way up here up in Woodbridge?”
 
  “I should be asking you the same. What are you doing with the Broke-a-Loids, and who’s your little girlfriend here?” 
  Meiko sternly said.
 
  “‘Broke-a-Loids’? What. Whaddya mean? Y’all got some kinda beef?”
 
  “
  YES.
  ”, barked Teto. 
 
  For some reason unbeknownst to Ian, Teto’s drills had already turned on. Neru had obtained an ornate, onyx sword from god-knows-where, and Haku was similarly spontaneously a desert eagle. Ian began to realize what was going on. 
 
  “Oh. OH NO NO NO. Iiiiii ain’t gettin’ in some fuckin’ 
  
    gang war
  
   over a stupid meme! Count me the FUCK out!”
 
  Ian turned to walk away, but unfortunately found himself unable to move his legs. 
 
  “w-w-het”, he whimpered.
 
  “
  Ian.
  ”, direly said Teto. “
  Are you ready?
  ”
 
  “For what?”

  “
  TO 
  BATTLE!
  ”, screamed Meiko, the Fifth Vocaloid, rushing towards the quintet, with a bulky, bronze mace in her hands.

  “WHY ARE THERE NUMBERS EVERYWHERE!?”, hoarsely cried out Ian.
 
  Strange arrays of what seemed to be numbers and words had surrounded the six of them. The Boukaloids’ and Meiko’s numbers seemed to be much bigger than either Eli’s or Ian’s, although his always seemed to be a fixed distance in front of him, rather than the wrap-around displays.
 
  “
  That’s your Heads-up Display, dumbass!
  ”, said Teto.
 
  One of Teto’s dials flashed white. For whatever reason, during this exchange, Meiko hadn’t budged an inch. Was she just being polite?
 
  “
  DRRRRRRRILL RUSH ATTACK!
  ”, cried out Teto!
 
  Teto rushed forward in a half-running, half-flying sort of motion. 
 
  KRRCK!
 
  The number “351” flashed above Meiko as Teto landed her hit.
 
  “What the fuck.”
 
  “
  Ian, have you ever played a JRPG?
  ”, said Haku.
 
  “Uh, yes. Why are you asking me that now?” Neru was doing something with her sword. Probably, an attack. That is what one typically does with swords.
 
  “
  It’s just like that. Just like, uh, 
  
    Chrono Trigger
  
   or something.”
 
  Haku pulled up her handgun and popped some caps into Meiko. More numbers flew around, “75, 78, 74”.
 
  “What do you mean ‘just like 
  
    Chrono Trigger
  
  ?’”
 
  “
  Ya go around, ya take your turn, and do your attack. Must be Eli’s turn now.”, said Haku.
 
  “It is? Uh, shit, how do I do that? I don’t know how I summoned those icicles before!
  ”, said Eli.
 
  “Just press [REDACTED].
  ”, said Neru.
 
  “WHAT?”
 
  “You heard me! [REDACTED], it’s right there!
  ”
 
  Eli moved her hand a bit, and the H.U.D. followed suit. She picked the one that looked familiar to her. 
 
  “
  
    Icicle Breaker!
  
  ”
 
  Shards of ice formed above Meiko and came crashing down just as quickly. More numbers flew out, “71, 75, 72, 70.”
 
  “
  Ian! Your turn!
  ”, shouted Neru!
 
  “WHAT!? What the fuck am I supposed to do?”, cried Ian.
 
  “Uh, something!” 
  Haku smiled poorly.
 
  “That really isn’t helping!” Ian tried looking around his HUD, but his options were pretty limited. “How do I do these cool anime attacks like you guys?”
 
  “
  Looks like you can’t.
  ” 
 
  Ian screeched, somewhat resembling a velociraptor in the process.
 
  “Uh, uh, then, I’ll do 
  
    this
  
  !”
 
  Ian over confidently walked right up to Meiko, attempting to emulate a Chad Stride, and failing to do so.
 
  “Hey.”
 
  Meiko looked at him with a puzzled expression on her face.
 
  “I think you’re a
  
     cringe ass nae nae baby
  
  ” he announced, poking her in the chest.
 
  
    1044!
  
 
  Meiko made a strange noise.
 
   It reminded Ian of when his cat got her flu shot last year. But he didn’t have time to reminisce, as Meiko soond had a counterattack of her own.
 
  SWRNCH!
 
  The Mace connected directly into Ian’s sternum, clearly breaking something.

  “OH! MOTHERFUCKER!”, he shouted.
 
  Numbers flew out of Ian this time, “400!”.
 
  “
  And now it’s 
  
    my
  
   turn!
  ”, Meiko roared.
 
  
    “KILOBLASTER!”
  
 
  Meiko wildly swung her mace around, launching fireballs from the head. Most of the gang was successful in dodging them. 
  
    Most of them.
  
   Not Ian. 
 
  Ian swore as a fireball hit his square in the shoulder. Surprisingly, it wasn’t hot, although it was extremely painful. 
 
  “
  Ian’s hit, can someone get him up on their turn?
  ”, said Teto.
 
  “I’ll do it…”
  , said Eli begrudgingly.
 
  “Cool. Anyways,
 
  
    DRRRRRILL BLASTER!
  
  ”
 
  Teto used the same attack she had on Eli the previous day. Drills rocketed forth and crashed into Meiko, knocking her over.
 
  “
  damt
  ”, said Meiko. 
 
  
    250!
  

  Neru turned to Ian.
 
  “
  Look I don’t know that the fuck you just did, but it seemed to work. Try and do that again next time, ‘k?
  ”, she said, for once, in a positive mood.
 
  “Aiiight”, Ian wheezed, probably internally bleeding like the MORTAL that he was.

   

  Neru charged forward, her sword plunging into Meiko’s body. 
 
  A critical hit!
 
  
    831!
  
 
  “Oh, nice. So now Haku goes again, and--  wait, where is she?”, said Ian.
 
  “
  Probably ran out of whisky 
  
    again
  
  . She should be back soon.
  ”, said Teto.
 
  “SOON? But she should be here now!”
 
  Teto shrugged. “
  Tough shit.
  ”
 
  “
  Ian here, take this.
  ” Eli reached into one of the several bags she was carrying. 
 
  “An off-brand V8?”
 
  “
  No, not really. Just drink it!
  ”
 
  Ian wasn’t really sure what the hell this dark green stuff was, but if Eli was giving it to him, 
  
    surely
  
   it couldn’t be bad.
 
  
    150 HP recovered!
  
 
  “wait what, Oh, OH! I gotta go now!”
 
  Ian once again resumed his shitty Chad Stride. 
 
  “
  Are you seriously going to call me a bitch 
  
    again?
  
  ”, grumbled Meiko.
 
  Ian did not.
 
  Instead, he jammed his fingers directly into Meiko’s eyes! The pupils felt strangely squishy!
 
  “
  
    awwwWWWWAHHHH!
  
  
    ”
  

  500! 
  Meiko
   can’t see!

   

  It was Teto’s turn next, or rather it 
  
    would have been
  
  .
 
  “
  Eli, why the fuck do you have PoPiPo™ on you?
  ”, said Teto.
 
  “
  What do you mean?
  ”
 
  “
  That ‘green stuff’ you got, it’s from one of Miku’s Companies! You’re literally giving money to our enemy!
  ”
 
  “
  Oh, … oh no. How was I supposed to know that? (But more importantly, why are they enemies?)
  ”, said Eli.
 
  Meiko had had enough of the argument and attacked again.

  “
  
    KILOBLASTER!
  
  ”
 
  This time, she seemed more erratic in her movements, likely due to the whole “I got poked in the eyes” thing. The fireballs all shot towards Teto, Neru, and Errichi.
 
  “uh, guys… There’s, ah-” But Ian couldn’t warn them fast enough. The explosion caught the three of them in its blast. 
 
  “Oh shit! You guys okay?!” Ian rummaged through Eli’s bag to find another bottle of whatever magic juice she threw at him, but all he found were various chocolates. 
 
  “Uh, this’ll do right? Food heals HP?”, said Ian, but Eli really didn’t seem to like that...
 
  “
  IAN, NO!
  ”
 
  “Does it... not heal HP, then?”
 “Пиздец, that’s my chocolate!”  
  But they didn’t have to fuss, for Haku had returned! In her car! 
  
    Visibly intoxicated!
  
  
  
  

  “
  This is 
  
    my
  
   - hic - special attack! 
  
    DRUNK DRIVING!
  
  ”
 
  Haku floored it, plowing directly into and right over Meiko, who made an odd crunching sound.
 
  
    3552!
  
 
  And with that rather overkill attack, Meiko collapsed 
  
    and didn’t get back up
  
  . Maybe she needed Life Alert.
 
  Neru approached Meiko as Teto’s drills slowed to a crawl.

  “Now, Ian, 
  
    The only way to kill a Vocaloid is to cut out the Core, they’ll just regenerate within a matter of time otherwise.
  
  ”, said Neru.

  “The Core? YOU’RE KILLING HER!?”, squeaked Ian.
 
  “
  Nah, but this ought to remove her powers. Removing the source -- that Core -- should make her no more of a threat to us. Now help me flip her over.
  ”
 
  “So, Haku ran her over, and now while she’s unconscious, we gotta surgically remove her heart so she isn’t a magical girl anymore?”
 
  “
  Wow, Ian, you sure learn quickly!
  ”, said Teto half-sarcastically.

  Ian felt a sense of dread as Neru used her sword to rip right through the now-comatose Meiko. An otherworldly, mechanical whirring noise filled the parking lot as Neru pulled out The Core™. Unfortunately, Neru didn’t do a very 
  
    clean
  
   job at that, and what appeared to be blood dripped out of Meiko, as Neru beheld a strange-looking, glowing red… ping pong ball?
 
  Meiko’s mace disappeared with a clatter and any battle scars left behind on her disappeared. She turned back into a seemingly normal teenager. 
 
  “What the fuck. This chick was Meiko all along?”, said Ian.
 
  “
  Yep.
  ”, replied Neru.
 
  “Are you 
  
    all
  
   normal people without these, uh, Cores?”
 
  “
  I can’t remember who I was!
  ”, shouted Teto.
 
  “
  NOBODY ASKED YOU! But technically, not us three. There isn’t enough time to explain here. For all we know, someone could’ve called the cops while we were battling. We ought to get out of here.
  ”, said Neru.
 
  “SO WE’RE LEAVING MEIKO?”
 
  “
  yeah.
  ”, said Teto. 
 
  “
  WHAT!?
  ”, Eli shrieked.
 
  “
  Don’t worry about her, she’ll be 
  
    fiiiiine~
  
  ”, said a very woozy Haku Yowane.
 
  “
  I really don’t like the idea of that.
 
  “
  Just get in the car.”
 
  “With 
  
    you?
  
   NO! No way!”,said Ian, internally accepting his fate to accompany these assholes. “I almost died here, there’s no-ho-
  
    ho 
  
  way I’m getting in the car with someone behind the wheel like 
  
    you.
  
  ” Ian turned to Neru. “So we ‘jumping’ out, or… ”
 
  “
  Yes!
  ”, said Neru.
 
  The dysfunctional quintet trailed behind Neru, as they rushed through a portal. Ian actually got to see what ‘jumping’ looked like, since he had closed his eyes while mansplaining earlier. They were running through some sort of glowing tunnel, with streams of ichorous yellow flow lining the “floor”.
 
  “Where… is this?”, Ian asked.
 
  “
  Don’t worry about it, just 
  
    go!
  
  ”, said Neru.
 
  As the strangehalway ended in another “door”, the gang appeared in the middle of the President’s Park quad.
 
  “So anyways, that’s enough craziness for 
  
    one 
  
  day…”
 
  Unfortunately for our begrudging protagonist, this was 
  
    not
  
   going to be the end of today’s craziness…

  “Kaito. Kaito this is important.”
  , said Michelle, over the phone again.
 
  “What is it, Hatsune
  
    ?
  
  ” Kaito Shion, the Fourth Vocaloid, responded.
 
  “It’s about Meiko. We’ve lost all signs of her. Vitalities cut out about an hour ago in a mall parking lot, and the last thing she reported were the Boukaloids.”
 
  “The Boukaloids? 
  
    Again
  
  ? Well, this can’t be good.”
 
  “And that’s not the worst part. 
  
    IAN’s 
  
  there, too. Along with an unknown blonde-haired individual.”
 
  “Your crazy friend, Ian, with the Boukaloids? That asshole who just lounged around in my club? Never thought I’d see the day! Do you think they’re trying to use him to get dirt on us?”
 
  “Based on what I heard from Meiko, it could be far, far worse. Neru cut out her Core.”
 
  “N-neru did what now… ?”
 
  “The Boukas, Ian, and the blonde all ganged up on her, Haku ran her over, and then Neru pried out her Core with her Drive, and she presumably still has it. Why, all of a sudden, they’re doing this
  
     now
  
   is still a mystery to me. 2020’s been jank enough already, the last thing any of us need on our plates is the three of them making a resurgence.
  ”
 
  “And the fact that Ian’s involved is just going to make it worse! Surely, he has no idea what they’re really up to!”
 
  “Which is why I want 
  
    you
  
   to go to Ian and…
  
     knock some sense into him
  
  , yeah, do that. I don’t think the Boukas are still with 
  
    him
  
  . You might want to watch out for Ian’s blonde acquaintance, however. Meiko said she got some 
  
    bad
  
   vibes off of her.”
 
  “Got it. He’s at, uh, George Mason, right?”
 
  “Yes. Ian said he lives in ‘Wilson Hall’, and that he usually goes to ‘Ike’s’ dining hall between 6:30 to 7:00 P.M. Should be plenty of time to 
  
    intercept
  
   him there….
  ”
 
  “Understood, Miku. I’m on my way there now.”
 
  Michelle hung up the phone. Hopefully, that would be the end of today’s “official business”.
 
  “Finally. I can get back to 
  
    Chrono Trigger: The Musical
  
  . Robo, my boy. My son. My child. Yeah. I’m love him.”
 
  In the video, Robo from 
  
    Chrono Trigger
  
   was doing the “default dance” from 
  
    Fortnite
  
   inside of an airplane hangar while a midi-fied version of Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” looped in the background.
 
  “Hmmmg. Robiss.”
 
  The quintet of morally questionable individuals had all made their way back into Ian’s room. Of course, with five of them now, it felt much more cramped. The dorm rooms were meant for two people at once, maximum. Ian eventually broke the uncomfortable silence, attempting to be a Chad.

  “So whatever happened to that gem thing?”, asked Ian.
 
  “
  What ‘gem thing’?
  ”, said Teto.
 
  “The little red gem-lookin’ thing Neru cut outta Meiko!”
 
  “
  I’m still holding on to it. And it’s not a ‘gem’ at all, it’s a ‘Core’.
  ”, said Neru.
 
  “A Core? Inside’a Meiko?” Ian looked confused. “N’ so when you took it out, that turned her off… Uh, 
  
    mechanically
  
  . Does th’ little ‘Core’ power 
  
    all
  
   of Meiko and let her do, uh, whatever she was doin’ with the mace and the bombs and the  whatnot?”
 
  “
  I suppose so. There’s a core inside of all of… 
  
    us
  
   that acts as a rough analogue to a soul. These devices are where almost all of our mana is stored, which lets us…  let’s just say it’s ‘magic’. That’s what your kind would call it anyways.
  ”
 
  “... Okay. But if 
  
    you
  
   and 
  
    Haku
  
   aren’t a Vocaloid in any way, how come you guys still have the same MacGuffin-Doohickeys?”
 
  “
  Haku and I are both known as ‘derivatives’ of the one and only Miku Hatsune.
  ”
 
  “Ah, yes. The limit as h approaches zero of f of x plus h minus f of x, all over h.”
 
  To this, Neru face-palmed and muttered something to herself in what seemed to be Japanese.
 
  “
  Y𝙹⚍ ᓵ𝙹ᒲ!¡ꖎᒷℸ ̣ ᒷ ᒲ𝙹∷𝙹リ, リ𝙹ℸ ̣  ᒷ⍊ᒷ∷||ℸ ̣ ⍑╎リ⊣ ╎ᓭ ᓭℸ ̣ ᒷᒲ..
  ”
 
  “
  I’d say it’s more along the line of alternate Timeline Mikus.
  ”, Haku said, noticing her partner-in-crime’s dismay.
 
  “
  Alternate Timeline Mikus?!
  ”, said Eli.
 
  “
  Yup.
  ”
 
  “What the hell kinda timelines are 
  
    y’all
  
   from, if 
  
    my
  
   timeline’s Miku is… well, the way she is?”
 
  “
  Don’t worry about it.
  ” Ian did not heed Haku’s advice, and worried about it anyways, although entirely internally. Unfortunately, she seemed to notice. Eli still couldn’t believe what she was hearing. She turned over to Teto.
 
  “
  So are you some sort of ‘Parallel Miku’, too? Why does that make you some sort of 
  
    demon
  
  ?
  ” 
 
  Teto got a smug look on her face that was rather uncomfortable to look at.

  “
  WELL. I’ll have you know, tankie, that 
  
    I’m
  
   not a 
  
    Vocaloid
  
   at all, since 
  
    I 
  
  was created by glorious 
  
    UTAU
  
  !
  ”, Teto said overly triumphantly. She sure was proud of her heritage.
 
  “Which is… ?”, inquired Ian. Teto’s smugness intensified to levels not physically possible.
 
  “
  
    An open-sourced and completely free-to-access alternative and 
  
  
    competitor
  
  
     to that overhyped, overpriced Vocaloid snobbery! Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho!
  
  
    ”, 
  
  she continued.
 
  Neru and Haku looked at each other, and then crawled under Ian’s bed and through the portal that lies beneath. Why Teto couldn’t have picked a better spot for the Gate was a mystery to everyone, maybe even to Teto.
 
  “are you done. are you- are you done yet”, Ian stammered. He started to think that Teto was the real snob here.
 
  “
  NO! 
  
    UTAU has ma-
  
  ”
 
  “Well, in that case, Eli and I are headin’ out. Since she just, uh, ‘arrived’ yest’rday, I think it’d be best to show her around campus. Best not for her to get lost, y’know?” Ian turned to his right with a phony grin on his face. “
  
    Isn’t that right, Erri-chi?
  
  ” 
 
  “
  Y-Yeah… I don’t even know where the library is!
  ”, Eli feigned.
 
  Teto was still on her UTAU-Shilling rant as the couple closed the door behind them. One could vaguely hear her continue from the other side.
 
  Ian waited until they were on the other side of Patriot Circle before speaking. 
 
  “Why are we friends with them?”, he said.
 
  “
  Good question. I should be asking you that.
  ”, replied Eli rather scornfully.
 
  “Watanabe?” “
  Who?
  ” “...Nevermind.”

  The two had been sitting outside of the Johnson Starbucks for some time now. Somewhat obviously, there had been no ‘campus tour’. 
 
  “Alright, it’s been two hours. Ya think it’s safe to go back now?”, Ian said in between intermittent sips, attempting to get the last bits of whipped cream out of his Frappuccino. 
 
  Eli put down her coffee and laughed.
 
  “
  Well, I sure hope so.
  ”
 
  The two headed back to the dorm. 
 
  “So why exactly do you think that these, uh, whaddaya call ‘em, 
  
    Derivative Mikus
  
  , came to 
  
    me 
  
  of all people to help ‘em off the ‘real’ Miku?” Ian pondered, out loud, probably thinking he was important. “What do they mean by ‘the inside joke is true’? Is all of it true? Is Michelle actually some sort of alien with a narcissism complex, and that also killed Solid Snake? Wouldn’t that also mean Solid Snake is real?”
 
  Eli turned to Ian with a rather puzzled demeanor.
 
  “
  I was literally not sentient two days ago, why the fuck are you asking 
  
    me
  
   any of that?
  ”
 
  “fair enough”
 
  Ian unlocked the door, and to his surprise, there were absolutely zero alien-slime-robot-things. No Neru, no Haku, and certainly no Teto. For now, at least. Certainly, a brief respite in the chaos to come. 
 
  “OH THANK GOD.”
 
  Eli glanced at Ian’s alarm clock.
 
  “
  Isn’t it about that time when Chuggaconroy uploads? You’ve always been here watching those videos 
  
    right
  
   when he uploads.
  ”
 
  “Oh shit, you’re right!”
 
  Ian grabbed his laptop off the desk and plopped down a bit too hard onto his “couch”. 
 
  “aren’t you going to join me?”
 
  “
  s-sure…
  ” 
 
  Ian set the computer down while the ottoman opened it up. Unfortunately, 
  
    someone was at the window
  
  . The second floor window. And that someone was none other than 
  
    Teto Kasane
  
  !
 
  Smashing through the glass, and scattering bits of the window and the bug mesh everywhere, she grabbed the laptop out of Ian’s hands.
 
  “
  EYYYYYYYYYYIIIIIIII!
  ”, he screeched autistically!
 
  “
  
    So while you two were gone, I had Uta get on your PC here and install UTAULOID for ya, you should check out some time and experiment with it, a-
  
  ” How was she still on her high horse!?
 
  “HOW THE FUCK AM I S’POSED T’PAY FOR THE WINDOW!?”, Ian yelled!
 
  “
  Mmm, but I think you ought to be concerned with the well-being of your waifu, 
  
    buddy
  
  . Some boyfriend you are!
  ”
 
  Ian turned around, expecting to see her with a piece of glass sticking out her forehead.
 
  “Aa-
  oh.
  ” Instead, Eli just wasn’t a person anymore. In her place stood, or rather, lied the same, beat-up nesoberi Ian knew from just two days ago. 
 
  “
  ELI?
  ” Ian seemed beside himself. 
 
  The Eli from earlier that day popped back into existence after a few seconds, falling off of the “couch”.
 
  “
  I-I’m fine…
  ”, she said wearily.
  



  “I really think you aren’t. Did you do that, Teto?”, Ian said.
 
  “
  I think it had more to do with you screaming, so no.
  ”, retorted Teto.
 
  “
  You literally burst through the window like the fucking Kool-Aid Man.
  ”, reretorted Eli.
 
  “
  Of course, but-

  “
  
    ENOUGH OF THE BLABBERING, IT’S CHUGGAA-O’CLOCK!”, 
  
  bellowed Ian.
 
  “
  Why?
  ” A strange and zealous look grew on Ian’s face, although thankfully different from the one Neru happened to see in the bookstore.
 
  Without a word, Ian hopped up, grabbed his squid hat from on top of the dresser, and put it on. 
 
  “DA! DAH DAH DAH DAH DADBADA DEDAHDAH BUHDUH, DEHDAH!”
 
  “
  Ian, what does that 
  
    mean?
  
  ”, asked Eli.
 
  “don’t worry about it”, Ian wrote off as 
  HE
   appeared on the laptop.
 
  “
  
    HEY, EVERYBODY! It’s Chuggaaconroy! Last time, we got some Green Stars, this time, well, we’re gonna go get some more Green Stars! And stop asking about the chimney!
  
  ” The voice of RODOLFO, The Many Tentacled, and number one best YouTuber, resounded from the laptop.
 
  Teto and Eli had no idea what was happening, but, nonetheless, Ian seemed to really enjoy himself. The “show” wrapped up about nineteen minutes later.
 
  “Anyways what was I supposed to do? Riiight, I was supposed to meet up with Matthew for dinner…” 
 
  “
  Matthew?
  ”, said Eli.
 
  “A friend of mine, do you want to come with, Eli?”
 
  “
  Why can’t I come?
  ”, asked Teto.
 
  “They don’t have baguettes, for one!” Ian said, intending to be sarcastic, but not 
  
    quite
  
   pulling it off.
 
  “
  count me out, then…
  ” Teto defeatedly said before sliding back under the bed.
 
  “AND TWO- Wait. Oh, shouldn’t you guys be keepin’ a lookout?”
 
  “
  For what?
  ”
  



  “That uh, the ‘Vocaloid’ we ran into outside the mall today. She said her name was ‘Meiko’, right?. Aren’t there, like, 
  
    five others
  
  , Miku notwithstanding?”
 
   Teto grew concerned.
 
  “
  Y-you’re right, but I don’t think another one would attack 
  
    this
  
   soon…
  ”, she said, actually nervous for once.
 
  “If we really 
  
    are
  
   dealing with some sort of crazed demigoddess, 
  
    as you claim
  
  , then why 
  
    wouldn
  
  ’
  
    t
  
   she go all-out after the first sign of a big threat? Now, if 
  
    anybody
  
  -” Ian waved his hand around towards the bottom of the bed. “- else needs me, Eli and I are going to Ike’s. Cya, bitch!”, he said storming off.
 
  “
  Do I have to go with him?
  ”, dully asked Eli. 
 
  “
  Do you want to live to see tomorrow?
  ”, asked Teto.
 
  “
  ...I’ll take that as a yes.
  ”


  5:54 P.M.
 
  “
  So who’s Matthew, again?
  ”, asked Eli.
 
  “One of my friends from class last semester.”
 
  Matthew was waiting outside of the dining hall, looking at something on his phone. He was a bespectacled rather tall sort of fellow, but not as tall as Ian.
 
  “
  
    Hey, Ian! How’s it been?
  
  ” Matthew noticed that Ian wasn’t walking by himself tonight.
 
  “Oh, Matt, this is my girlfriend, … Eli…” Literally the first line of dialogue, and he had already made it awkward. Truly, Ian was a master at this.
 
  “
  
    ... Ian. Since when did you have a girlfriend?
  
  ”, asked a very doubtful Matthew.
 
  Eli grew nervous.
 
  “Uh… last week.”, said Ian. Did he just not recognize that he was standing next to a (at least as of three days ago) fictional character?
 
  
    “You started dating… last week?
  
  ”, inquired Matthew.
 
  “
  Yes.
  ”, said Ian. Matthew pressed further.
 
  “
  
    Dude, then why didn’t you tell me when you saw me Tuesday!?
  
  ”, he asked.
 
  Ian smirked.  “Why, I didn’t think I’d get a second date!” No one laughed at his joke.
 
  “
  
    So this is you guys’ second time together?
  
  ”
 
  “
  ...Yep.
  ”, said Eli.
 
  “It’s the third!”
 
  “
  What do you mean ‘it’s the third’?
  ”, said Eli.
 
  “We went to Burger King today? Doesn’t that count?”
 
  “
  No! They got my order wrong anyways.
  ”
 
  “Well… I guess that makes it our second time together.”
 
  Matthew realized something.
 
  “
  
    Wait, your name is ‘Eli’, and you have blonde hair in a ponytail…
  
  ” Matthew asked as he grew puzzled. “
  
    ... Haven’t I seen you somewhere before?
  
  ”
 
  “
  M-maybe just around campus…
  ” a very nervous Eli responded.
 
  “
  
    Fair enough, there’s, like, 30,000 people here.
  
  ”
 
  Ian objected, “Enough with the chit chat, let’s get some grub goin’!”, and headed inside, leaving the others.
 
  Matthew gave Eli a strange look and laughed.
 
  “
  
    Why are you with him? You clearly deserve better.
  
  ” 
 
  “
  I have no fucking clue.
  ” He got closer to Eli.
 
  “
  
    Just between you and me… Get away from him while you still can! Far, far away!
  
  ”, Matthew whispered.
 
  “
  Uh… thanks.
  ”

  “
  Aaaand, three…, two…, one…, Six O’clock, right on the dot. Ian’s supposed to be inside there.
  ”
 
  Kaito walked closer to Ike’s. 
 “And there he is… Ian…  with two others. In the food place. Ugh, there’s way too much attention if I pull anything in there. Is there a way to draw Ian out? Might as well go in and give it a shot…”   
  “So anyways, that’s how I figured out that cutting your fingernails is a JoJo reference.”, Ian said before scarfing down another slice of subpar Sodexo pizza. Matthew pretended to care, solemnly nodding. Eli interrupted Ian’s ‘feasting’. 
 
  “
  how do you even manage yourself to eat trash like 
  
    this
  
  ?
  ”, eyeing the other two slices, that had presumably hardened by now.
 
  “Oh? Ike’s Pizza? Ya get used to it.”, said Ian.
 
  “
  
    You’re an on-campus student, and yet you haven’t been exposed to Ichael’s Pizza yet?
  
  ”, Matthew exclaimed in disbelief.
 
  It was clear to Ian that Eli had to improvise.
 
  “
  I live at Global…
  ”
 
  “And you haven’t been to Ike’s 
  
    once?
  
  ”
 
  “
  W-well I just transferred here at the start of this semester, a-and-
  ”
 
  Eli’s improv was cut short by a new voice.

  “
  Ian!!
  ”, he yelled. A few people turned to look, before resuming their usual inanity. A strange man was standing in the dining hall. He had deep blue eyes and even bluer hair, which must have cost him a fortune in hair dye. Furthermore, he was wearing some kind of strange-looking trench coat, that reminded Ian of a lab coat.
 
  “Jake? From the STEM Club last year?”, said Ian naively.
 
  
    “(
  
  
    HOW DID HE KNOW WHO I WAS!?)
  
  
    ”, 
  
  thought Kaito. Maybe, just maybe, it’s because they were in the same club.
 
  “Did you dye your hair blue?”, asked Ian.
  



  Matthew looked bewildered.
 
  “
  
    You know this freak?
  
  ”, he asked.
 
  “Well yeah, we were in the same club last year in high school.”, said Ian. “Hey, how’s being the club president working out?”
 
  “
  I’m not here for small talk.
  ”, “Jake” said sternly. 
 
  “Well, why’re you at George Mason? Did ya get lost on your Orientation tour or somethin’?”
 
  “
  No. If you 
  
    have
  
   to know why I’m here,” 
  Jake slammed his fists on the table.
   
 
  “Why don’t we find somewhere 
  
    quiet
  
  ….?
  ” He got dangerously close to Ian. It was kind of awkward. “
  Without many people around.
  ”
 
  “Do I have to?”, asked Ian.
 
  “
  Yes!
  ”, said “Jake.”
 
  “Matthew and I were gonna hang afterwards, can he come, too?”, asked Ian.
 
  “
  No.
  ”, said “Jake” irritatedly. 
 
  “Sorry, Matthew.” He didn’t seem to mind. “Okay, fine. We’ll go to a parking lot or something. What the 
  
    hell
  
   could be so important…”
 
  Ian got up and left, with the strange individual pursuing him.
 
  “
  
    I’m…  going after them.
  
  ” Eli muttered as Matthew seemed to be extremely concerned.
 
  “You… 
  
    do 
  
  realize Ian’s gonna get murdered or something, 
  
    right
  
  ?”, said Matthew.
 
  “
  Yes, and this is the 
  
    second
  
   time I’m going to have to cover for his sorry butt.
  ”, Eli bemoaned before exiting the dining area. 
 
  “The 
  
    SECOND time!?
  
  ” She was already out the door before Matthew could get another word.
 
  Matthew sat back down.
 
  “Huh, come to think of it, Ian’s anime toy-thing he showed off several times… wasn’t that character’s name Eli, too? With blonde hair, in a ponytail?” He furrowed his brow.
 
  “Hm. Must be a coincidence.”




  6:21 P.M.
 
  It had seemed the sky had seemingly become 100% overcast. No stars would be seen even if it 
  
    weren
  
  ’
  
    t
  
   so cloudy, given the amount of streetlights peppered across the parking lot the two were in. 
 
  “Okay, 
  
    here
  
  . Is Lot A 
  
    quiet
  
   enough for you, 
  
    Jake
  
  ?”, said Ian, sarcastically.
 
  “
  Stop calling me ‘Jake’!
  ”, said… Well, Ian 
  
    thought
  
   he was Jake.
 
  “... But that’s your name?”
 
  “
  It really isn’t.
  ” No. This was, in fact, NOT Jake, from the STEM club, or at the very least, not him right now.
 
  “Oh?”
 
  Ian noticed the tattoo on his left shoulder: “CV-04”. It matched the tattoo on Meiko, who attacked him earlier that day. Before him stood none other than CV-04, Kaito Shion!

  ]
 
  “OH.” It just took Ian a minute to process what was about to go down. “You’re gonna to stab me now, aren’t ya, 
  
    Kaiko
  
  ? Take yer rooty-tooty-pointy-n’shooty n’ bash m’head in?”
“Kaito. And, no, good sir, I have something else in mind! Something only the likes of a gamejacker like you ought to deserve!”, yelled  
  “Well, first, have I got somethin’ to say to 
  
    you
  
  !”, Ian said,
 
  Once again, Ian pulled off his Chad Stride, right up to his potential assassin. 
 
  “Guess what”
 
  Kaito said nothing, glaring into Ian’s soul with a mixture of anger and contempt. He was not going to guess, for he, an accomplished engineer, knew better than that.
 
  “
  
    I think you’re a bitch.
  
  ”
 
  No effect!
 
  “wat?”, said Ian.
 
  “
  Did you really 
  
    think
  
   that stupid, stupid trick was going to work a s
  
    econd time?
  
  ”, taunted Kaito.
 
  “Yes.”
 
  “
  Well, it wouldn’t! I really don’t know what you were expecting.
  ”
 
  Kaito unsheathed what he was hiding beneath his coat -- some kind of metallic, blue crossbow.
 
  “
  You really shouldn’t have done that, Ian.
  ”
 
  “Why, are you gonna shoot me now?”
 
  “
  No. I was planning on beating you upside the head with this-- OF COURSE I’M GONNA FUCKING SHOOT YOU. FOR THIS, IS MY GREATEST CREATION YET, THE CUSTOM DRIVE, THE BOREINATOR!!
  ”, yelled Kaito.
 
  “It’s about to half bore me to death.”, said Ian. Kaito seemed like he was going to do the “anime-glasses-push” thing, but unfortunately for him, he wore contacts.
 
  “
  
    WHY, GOOD SIR, AS A MATTER OF FACT, 
  
  
    YES! 
  
  
    THIS BAD BABY CAN BORE STRAIGHT THROUGH EVEN NETHERITE-PLATED TITANIUM, USING ONLY WATER, ONE OF THE MOST COMMON SUBSTANCES ON EARTH, AND MY CUSTOM-MIXED ABRASIVE AGENT!!
  
  ”
 
  “Netherite’s s’posed to be real…? Seriously, is this all some kind of Bad LARP?”
 
  The crossbow had been charging some sort of bluish energy. Was this that “magic” stuff that Neru was carrying on about? Was this the same deal across the board, with Whatever Meiko was doing, Teto’s, uh, 
  
    drills
  
  , and Eli’s supposed cryomancy?
 
  “
  
    YOUR TALK BORES ME, INTERLOPER!
  
  ” Kaito took aim, and the tip of the “bolt” glowed cerulean. “
  SHINEI, IAN!!
  ”, he roared, pulling the trigger! Ian braced for impact
  



  A watery beam of pure energy rocketed forth, striking Ian square in the gut! He stumbled over, and… that was about it. Ian opened his eyes to find out that, unfortunately, the only hole in him was emotional in nature.
 
  “
  NANI!?
  ”, yelled Kaito. He checked some of the dials on the BOREINATOR. He was supposed to replace the weapon’s abrasive tank today, however, he had forgotten. The beam that struck Ian had been nothing more than oddly light water. This was bad for Kaito, but good for Ian, because any other way would result in him missing his entire torso. 
 
  “
  KA! KAHAHA! IT MATTERS NOT! FOR I, SHION KAITO, HA-
  ”
 
  “Bitch, you ruined my one good shirt!”, Ian interrupted. He took the flannel button down off, due to the fact that it was now absolutely soaked. Thankfully, he still had a plain, white t-shirt underneath. No one in their right mind would want to behold the sight of Ian shirtless, Human, Cryptloid, School Idol, or whatever.
 
  “
  You know what, maybe I WILL bash your head in with this thing! Look at that! 
  
    The fool turns out to be right!
  
   What is this, Twitter?
  ”, Kaito boasted.
 
  Unfortunately for him, it wasn’t that simple, as the two were clearly some distance apart, and the BOREINATOR was connected to a spare water tank on Katio’s back (how he got that into Ike’s without anyone knowing is a mystery), so it’s not like he could throw it.
 
  His only option, then, was to rush Ian, who seemed to be anticipating this, pulling out a certain Central European multitool, attempting to counterattack.
 
  Katio got a good few swings in, scoring the first few hits!
 
  120! 80! 100!
 
  But Ian seemed to go under his blows, repeatedly striking his abdomen!
 
  
    510! 490! 500!
  
   
 
  Back and forth they went, 
  
    mano y mano
  
  , for several minutes!
 
  Eli happened to finally make it onto the scene, but upon seeing Ian and Kaito trapped in a Big Ball of Violence™, with both human and nonhuman blood being shed, decided that it would be best to wait it out. A part of her even hoped Ian lost. 
 
  Fortunately, the ball didn’t last long, as Ian pinned Kaito by the  back of the neck to the pavement and raised his knife high. For a split second, Eli could’ve sworn she saw a terrible glint in Ian’s eye, right before he plunged the knife down into Kaito’s head. Repeatedly. 
 
  “
  
    Tyehehehehehe!!
  
  
    ”
  
  , Ian cackled, but to be frank, it didn’t even sound like him. Ian prepared for a killing blow, plunging the knife straight into Kaito’s back, straight through his coat, as he let out a yelp!
 
  
    3,500!
  
 
  He pulled out a small, glowing, deep blue, somewhat triangular ball, and a similar whirring sound filled the nigh-abandoned parking lot. Ian’s whole arm was also covered in a vaguely gelatinous, cerulean substance. Katio’s hair had also turned from blue to black
 
  Eli decided that now would be a good time to reemerge, only to find Ian perfectly back to his senses.
 
  “
  Дерьмо! What the fuck happened here!?
  ”, she cried out. Ian dropped Kaito and hastily stood up.
 
  “Uhh, good question. I think I won…”, he said nonchalantly. Ian wiped his hand off on his khakis, trying to get the goo off. It kind of felt like sand.
 
  “
  ‘Good question’? Don’t give me that, what with the maniacal laughter, and stabbing prowess that would make Kotori jealous!
  ”
 
  “I literally. Do not remember doin’ that.”, Ian said flatly.
 
  “Блять! How could you not remember when it was barely two minutes ago!?
  ”
 
  “Do I look like a fuckin’ psychiatrist to you?” 
 
  Eli just kind of stared at him for a minute. No. He didn’t. He looked like a failure
  
    .
  
   
 
  “
  Screw it, let’s just go back…
  ”
 
  “Yay! I get to go to bed!”
   
 
  “
  But it’s not even seven o’clock yet…?
  ”
 

  6:58 P.M.
 
  “So if anyone asks about what just happened, what’re we s’posed to tell ‘em?”, asked Ian.
 
  “
  About you being banged up?
  ”, responded Eli.
 
  “That, but more importantly, whatever crazy… blue guy that just showed up and tried to murder me.”
 
  Eli seemed discontented with that remark.
 
  “
  If anybody’s ‘crazy’ here, I’d say it’s you… 
  ”
 
  “Is this about the kazoo thing again?”
 
  “
  N-no, more so about-
  ”
 
  To Ian’s dismay, both Neru and Haku were in his room, seemingly waiting for him.
 “Oh, so how was dinner?~”, said Haku. 
  “
  Good RODOLFO, you look fucked up, what fresh hell happened to you?
  ”, said Neru.
 
  “I fell down the stairs!”, Ian vehemently replied. 
 
  “
  Uh-huh.
  ” Neru did a double take. 
 
  “
  You fell down the stairs and got bone-soaking wet in the process somehow?
  ”
 
  “mmmyes”
 
  “
  And then the stairs stained your pants blue?
  ”, Haku interjected.
 
  Ian’s improvisation clearly wasn’t working.
 
  “
  And to top it off, you got something in your coat pocket that’s glowing.
  ” Neru said, leaning forward, her hands coming together in a rather foreboding mannerism. “
  
    Would you mind if I had a look at it?
  
  ”
 
  “Why, yes, actually”, said Ian.
 
  But it seemed that DEN-2 was having none of Ian’s shit, because she seemingly made herself right at home in Ian’s coat. 
 
  “
  Ian. Where did you get this?
  ”, Neru articulated, holding the Core in her hand. To an untrained eye, it would resemble a trillion-cut sapphire.
 
  “
  
    from when I fell down the stairs
  
  ”, Ian sputtered.

  “
  Kaito, we got ambushed by Kaito. He somehow made his way over here to Mason, pinpointed Ian while we were at the dining hall, then lured him out to a remote parking lot before trying to kill him.
  ”, Eli explained.
 
  “
  Oh, shit.
  ”, said Haku.
 
  “
  If Kaito showed up within a matter of hours, well, that’s gonna be bad news for all of us.
  ” Neru turned and proceeded to glare right through Ian’s soul. “
  
    But more importantly, 
  
  Haku and I decided to look through this fucking thing whole you two were having fun with Kaito, and I’d like to take a moment to ask, just what the 
  
    everloving shit
  
   you plan on doing with 
  
    this
  
  ?!
  ”, pulling the M.G.E. out from a bag.
 
  “oh…” Ian seemingly didn’t know what he was supposed to do. 
 
  “
  ‘Oh.’ You don’t have an answer, do you? You dumbass! You bitch! Then what the fuck were we doing earlier? All for some 
  
    porn book
  
   so your hygy little brain would be satisfied for a few minutes, and then immediately throw it in the trash like the weeaboo, degenerate fatass that you are! I…
  ”
 
  “
  I think that’s enough, Neru
  ”, said Eli.

  ]
 
  “Wait.”, said Ian.
 
  Ian had a vacant look on his face, but not quite like the stab-happy demeanor he’d had a few minutes ago.
 
  “
  Oh, what the fuck is it 
  
    now
  
  !
  ” Neru threw her hands up in a sarcastic manner.
 
  “
  
    Where the hell is Teto?
  
  ”
 
  “
  As if I know… She never 100% listens to us.
  ”
 
  “
  Why are you asking that 
  
    now
  
  ?
  ”, asked Eli.
 
  All eyes were on Ian.
 
  “When she was, uh, making Eli, I saw her doing something with her arm. There was some kind of… evil juice coming out. Meiko and Kaito also were filled with juice, albeit of vastly different colors.” Ian said.
 
  “
  What?
  ”
  



  “What if… we get the juice on the MGE? What happens then? Would a monster girl come out or something? Would 
  
    all 
  
  of them come out?”
 
  “
  I don’t like where this is going…
  ”
 
  “
  
    I do!
  
  ”, chimed Haku.
 
  An uncomfortable wave of what can only be described as “What The Fuck” swept across the room.
 
  “
  Of course 
  
    you
  
   would…
  ”, said Neru.
 
  Ian resumed his rant.
 
  “The monster girls come out, and then we have 
  
    them 
  
  kill the Miku 
  
    for 
  
  us
  
    !
  
  ”
 
  “
  And just how are we gonna get them to do that?
  ”, said Neru, sarcastically.
 
  “Don’t these ‘cores’ have magical energy in them?”, asked Ian.
 
  “
  It’s not 
  
    technically 
  
  magic…
  ”, said Haku.
  



  “THEN WHAT IS IT?”, said Ian vehemently.
 
  “
  
    You wouldn’t get it…
  
  ”, dismissed Neru.
 
  “Aight. We got the 
  
    not
  
  -magic gem things, clearly a Macguffin of sorts. We use the two cores we have to do, uh, something, and when 
  
    the pink one
  
   inevitably shows up we can take hers, too.”
 
  “
  And you seriously think this will work?
  ”
 
  Ian hopelessly shrugged. “Maybe?”
 
   
  “
  I can see how it can work.
  ”, said Haku.
 
  “
  Only because you’re hygy?
  ”, retorted Neru.
 
  “
  Nah.
  ”
 
  Haku hopped off the “couch” and picked up the strange book. 
 
  “
  
    I wanna try it!~
  
  ”, said Haku, eerily happy.
 
  “RIGHT NOW?!”, yelled Ian, violating the dorm’s quiet hours policy.
 
  “
  
    Yep!~
  
  ”
 
  “
  
    What the hell are you doing!?
  
  
    ”, shrieked Eli.
  
  
    


  

  “
  
    Hoping that this works!~
  
  ”, Haku singsonginly said.
 
  “
  NOOO-!
  ”
 
  Neru looked like she was on the verge of crying. Fortunately for her ego, the group was interrupted by a sharp knocking at the door.
 
  “
  
    Uh, Ian?” 
  
 
  From the voice, it seemed it was Ian’s neighbor, Gary.
 
  “
  
    Are you all okay in there? There’s a lot of yelling going on.
  
  ” 
 
  “Uh, yeah, it’s just… a very intense…  game of… Monopoly…”, said Ian
 
  “
  
    Could you keep it down so I could study? I have an exam tomorrow.
  
  ”
 
  “Uh, we’ll try to… ”
 
  “
  
    Thaaanks
  
  ”, said Gary sarcastically.
 
  “you take care now”
 
  During the exchange, Haku had grabbed a fork out from Ian’s “kitchen totem pole”, a stack of a minifridge, a microwave, a coffee machine, and a bowl with utensils in it all on top of each other. Most students simply placed these on their desk or under their bed, but Ian refused to be normal for some reason. 
 
  “
  
    Here goes nothing.
  
  
    ”, said Haku.
  
 
  Both Eli and Neru were watching in a state of dread. 
 
  “You’re doing this inside?”, said Ian. “What if 
  
    all
  
   the monster girls come out? What then? They can’t fit in here.”
 
  “
  Uh… 
  ”, not even understanding what he was saying.
 
  But Haku didn’t think about that. She plunged the fork deep into her forearm, with a deep, purplish-black gel leaking out.
 
  “
  
    and now, step two…!
  
  ”, continued Haku in her prior singsong manner.
 
  Haku proceeded to smear some of the gel on the front cover of the MGE. 
 
  “
  That’s disgusting!
  ”, shrieked Neru.
 
  “
  I know, but it might work! Think of all the time we’ll save getting these assholes to do the dirty work!
  ”, said Haku, with just a hint of sarcasm.
 
  “
  And if it doesn’t… ?
  ”, asked Eli.
 
  It seems that Eli’s query was answered instantly.
 
  [Recommended Listening: 
  
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pONR6Td7Kq4
  
  ]
 
  The gel surrounded the book, and the MGE raised into the air by a couple feet or so.
 
  “
  Well, something’s happening.
  ”, said Haku flatly.
 
  
     
  
  “
  Clearly not anything good!
  ”, said Eli worriedly.
 
  The gel expanded and formed a ball around the book, which darkened and started to contract in on itself.
 
  “
  what the fuck. What the fuck!
  ” Neru cried, seeming bewildered. Ian had hid behind Eli, but it wasn’t very effective due to the sheer size difference between the two. The ball of gel started to swell.
 
  “
  Ian, what the heck is 
  
    that thing
  
  ?
  ” Eli feverishly asked, pointing at the pile of gel.
 
  Now, the MGE had shrunk to around the size and shape of a tennis ball, and sporting a similar look to fresh asphalt. The gel, on the other hand looked… Oh, who am I kidding. You know what the gel was turning into. Ian seemed to search deep within himself, before starting on a tangent..
 
  “I’d say it’s a Dark Slime. If I remember correctly, those bad boys are native to areas surrounding Demon Realms, and tend to be a bit on the hygyier side. The ball in the center functions as their brain, which most other species of Slimes lack. Thus, the Dark Slime tends to be much more clever than its other slimy cousins. Definitely watch out for the tentacles, ‘cause 
  
    they know how to use them
  
  , no doubt thanks to their brain.”
 
  “
  
    What the fuck does that 
  
  
    mean
  
  
    !?
  
  
    ”, 
  
  cried Neru.
 
  “Hey! No shouting!” Ian resumed being “smart”. “So if Teto has drills, and made Eli, who has Icicles, 
  
    blue drills
  
  , if you will, and Haku has a gun, wouldn’t that mean…?”

  ]

  The “Dark Slime”, as Ian called it, opened its “eyes”, which were more like two red spots floating on top of the gel. One of its hair, tentacle… 
  
    things
  
   formed a concave shape.
 
  “
  
    Gimme ur FUCKING money!
  
  ”, screeched the gelatinous creature.
 
  “Hey! No shouting! That’s against Dorm Rules!”, said Ian in no self-awareness of his own irony.
 
  But the slime didn’t want to listen to pesky 
  
    humans
  
  . A ball of slime shot out and splattered all over Ian. Disgusting!
 
  10!
 
  “
  
    The slime has a gun!
  
  ”, yelled Haku.
 
  “You bastard! This’ll take weeks to get all out!” This marked three articles of Ian’s clothing ruined in a single night.
 
  The slime didn’t give a single 
  
    fuck
  
  , and shoved Ian and Eli out of the way. It yanked open Ian’s desk drawer, and shoved another tentacle inside. Sweeping across the drawer, any and all loose change left around as sweeped up.
 
  “Yeeees…”, it snickered, “now I am 
  
    rich
  
  !”
 
  “I really don’t think that’s how it works…”, muttered Ian.
 
  The slime, or, only its head turned around. It proceeded to slap Ian repeatedly with its hair-tentacles. Clearly, it didn’t like being called out.
 
  3! 4! 3! 
  They weren’t very tough tentacles. They were made of slime, after all.
 
  “
  
    Won’t y’all get ‘er offa me!?
  
  ”, cried Ian.
 
  “
  Isn’t this what you’re into?
  ”, said Neru flatly.
 
  “NO!” He liked the Manticore better, anyways.
 
  3!
 
  “
  I thought you said no shouting…
  ”, said Haku.
 
  Something within the slime’s tiny brain clicked.
 
  “There’s no more money in here. I’m out!”, it said.
 
  “
  
    oh, please do!
  
  ”, Ian whelped. hE proceeded to hold the door both times on the way out open for the strange, semisolid creature.
 
  “
  
    Yeet
  
  !”, screeched the slime, as it bounced off, and thankfully away from the President’s Park Quad. 
 
  Ian wearily stumbled back into his room.
 
  “So would you say that worked?”, he said.
 
  “
  Did you just let that thing 
  
    go
  
  ?
  ”, asked Eli.
 
  “Well yeah.”
 
  Neru growled.

  “
  It seems that 
  
    I’ll
  
   have to go and get the fucker. Haku, you’re coming with me.
  ”
 
  “
  
    Do I have to?
  
  ”, she said.
 
  “
  Yes, you do. And Ian, if Teto bothers to show up again tonight, just tell her what happened. There’s no fucking point in beating around the bush now.
  ”
 
  “A-alright.”, he replied.
 
  The two Boukaloids stormed off in pursuit of the gelatinous robber. 

  “Eli.”
 
  “
  Oh, what now… 
  ”, she responded.
 
  “Can I get a hug?” 
 
  “
  
    why?
  
  
    ”
  
  
     
  
 
  “
  
    I had a bad day…”
  
   Ian said tearily.
 
  Eli sighed, considered not doing it, but then considered the ramifications of 
  
    not
  
   doing it. It was worth it to oblige, just this once.
 
  “
  suuure. Can you 
  
    please 
  
  take off your shirt first?
  ”
 
  “YEH?!” said Ian hygyly.
 
  “
  NO! Not like that! You’re covered in that… gunk… 
  ”, referring to both Kaito and the Dark Slime.
 
  “Aight”
 
  This isn’t one of 
  
    those
  
   fanfictions, so I won’t go into any details with something as scandalous as hugging, but do note that Ian felt significantly better about himself afterwards.
 
  500!



  “
  Look, I don’t know why we have to ‘
  
    Kill the Miku’
  
  , but clearly, hanging around these weirdos isn’t going to do me, and especially do 
  
    you,
  
   any good.
  ”
 
  “I’m sure it’ll all blow over… ”, said Ian wearily.
 
  “
  Are you 
  
    really
  
   sure about that?
  ”
 
  “Totally.”
 
  Ian careened onto his bed.
 
  “If anybody needs me, I’m going to proceed to die now.”
 
  “
  But it’s 7 o’clock?
  ”
 
  “Oh, no no, not like that!”
 
  Ian grabbed his pillow and screamed into it.

  “
  Why are you like this?
  ”, Eli asked, seeming more dead inside than after she went on /r/Otonokizaka and sorted by Controversial.
 
  “That’s a really a good question.”
 
  But it seems Ian could not rest yet, for someone had texted him! It was Matthew!
 
  “{
  
    Ian, you still alive? That guy at Ike’s looked pretty sketchy.
  
  }”
 
  “{Unfortunately for all parties involved, yes.}”
 
  “{
  
    Well, I dunno what happened, but you gotta contact the Mason PD or something!}
  
  ”
 
  “{Will do}”
 
  “{Good luck, man}”
 
  “{I’m gonna need it…}“
 
  “
  So who is that?
  ”
 
  “Matthew. He says I should contact MPD about Kayo-chin.”
 
  “
  HANAYO!? She’s here, too!?
  ” Eli seemed to get her hopes up. 
 
  “No, that blue fucker with’a gun that don’t work right.”
 
  “
  So you know his name, and you’re mispronouncing his name 
  
    on purpose?!
  
  ”
 
  “you got it, 
  
    Eli-chi
  
  ” Ian made finger guns.
 
  “
  Please do not do that again.
  ”
 
  “Aight, 
  
    time to call the pigs…
  
  ”, said Ian pensively.
 
  “
  Ian, doesn’t Michelle, … doesn’t Miku 
  
    hate
  
   the police? Wouldn’t that make things 
  
    worse
  
  ?
  ”
 
  “We’ve already made things worse, Eli, I don’t think bringing in more people would make things better. Anyways, if anyone needs me, I’m finna bed.” That was a complete 180.
 
  “
  You ‘finna bed’?
  ”
 
  “
  I’m finna bed
  ”, Ian retorted, before throwing himself onto his too-high bed.

  It was about an hour later that Neru and Haku returned from their impromptu hunting trip. They also seemed to be just a bit out of it.
 
  “
  
    Fuck that
  
  , she’s not our problem now.
  ”, griped Haku.
 
  Begrudgingly, Ian sat up in bed.
 
  “The dark slime?”, he asked.
 
  “
  Yuh.
  ”
 
  “
  
    S
  
  o you’re really gonna abandon your child like that?
  ”, said Teto with a smirk.
 
  “
  how is that gooey robber my kid
  ”, said Haku flatly.
 “Shut up!”, Neru interjected. “It went down a storm drain; there’s no way we’d ever find it easily in the sewer system.” She seemed to be annoyed by something. This was about as surprising as finding out that water is wet. Neru continued. 
  “
  More Importantly. Ian. What, IN RODOLFO’S NAME, Do you honestly think 
  
    monster girls
  
   are gonna help me-
  
    ,
  
   u-us destroy Hatsune?
  ” 
 
  “ ‘U’s’? I don’t know who you’re talking about! There’s only one μ’s here, and that’s Eli. Is Teto gonna make more of ‘em?”, asked Ian, rather accusatively.
 
  “
  THAT’S NOT WHAT I MEANT, DUMBASS! The Titty Monsters! Tell me why you think we need these obscene 
  
    things
  
   for our initiative!
  ”
 
  “Oh. The Mamono.” Ian sat his head on his fist, seeming to be deep in thought.

  “So when the robots get their cores taken out, they ‘turn off’, right?”
 
  “
  None of us are ‘robots’ like you would think of, so, uh, 
  
    don’t use that word
  
  …
  ”., said Teto.“
  That’s, racist Ian.
  ”
 “Fuck you. Whatever. They get their gems taken out, they lose magic, and they turn into people.” Ian seemed just a bit too giddy. “What if. They could turn themselves back on?”   
  “
  Core them again.
  ”, said Neru flatly.
 
  “No! You’d just be repeating the same thing over and over! That’s the definition of insanity! Get someone else to do that stuff for ya!” Now, this was a bit worrying. “And THAT’S where the Mamono come in!”
 
  “
  You keep saying ‘Mamono’. What does 
  
    that
  
   mean?
  ”, asked Eli, with a mild amount of concern.
 
  “It’s the monster girl word for monster girl.But that begs the question, where are we gonna get 'em? Monster girls aren’t real!”
 
  Teto pointed out the door, as if humoring Ian. “
  Well that one certainly was.
  ” Ian stood up. 
 
  “Keyword: 
  
    was
  
  . Are we gonna repeat that? First off, we’re gonna need a lot more copies if we go that route. Secondly, there’s no telling they won’t all be like 
  
    that… But… ah...  uh… uoh… 
  
  ” He seemed to be staring off into space, at a loss for words.
 
  “
  Go on, then. Take your time.
  ”, said Haku, “
  Thinking can be hard for someone like you.
  ” 
 
  “
  But these 
  
    cores
  
  … and the talk of ‘Alternate Universes’ got me thinking…
  ”
 
  Eli knew that “getting Ian thinking” was never a good thing.
 
  “
  If we had all six cores… Would it be possible to make a wormhole to an alternate universe where they 
  
    are real
  
  ?
  ”, said Ian, with just a bit too much enthusiasm to not be creepy.  “
  Ian. what the fuck.
  ”, spat Neru.
 
  “
  
    And then you fuck a manticore like you’ve always dreamed about, The End, go home now~
  
  ”, said Haku sarcastically.
 
  “
  No. Not yet. If the mamono are like 
  
    that,
  
   the first thing that comes to their mind would be 
  
    chaos
  
  . That being the case, releasing a large number of them into greater Virginia is obviously bad for people.
  ”, Ian ranted. Something seemed… off about him.
 
  “
  No shit!
  ”, yelled Teto. Eli didn’t feel comfortable anymore. (This, of course, implies she was comfortable in the first place)
 
  “
  
    We’ll put them back where they came from, and you guys will close the portal back up
  
  !

  “
  And what the fuck is the point of that!?

  “

  “
  YOU COULD BLAME THE DISASTER ALL ON MIKU!!
  ”, Ian yelled, with no respect for the dorm quiet hours. “
  The masses would love
  
     you
  
  , and 
  
    hate
  
   her! 
  
    Hatsune 
  
  and all her little friends would be shunned for the corrupt 
  
    cheaters
  
   that they are, and you, Haku and Teto would be crowned champions like you 
  
    deserve
  
  ! After all, ...
  ” Ian, who may not have even been the one talking right now, got closer to Neru. A little bit 
  
    too close
  
  “
  
    Isn’t that what you’ve always wanted, Neru-chan
  
  ?
  ”

  “
  Ian. That’s… 
  
    absolutely terrible
  
  … 
  ”, she said, half giggling.
 
  “
  
    Oh?
  
  ”
 
  For once in her wretched life, Neru seemed to be genuinely happy. 
 
  “
  I LOVE IT!!
  ”
 
  The two shared a hearty and rather maniacal laugh. Eli wasn’t having any of it.
 
  “
  (What’s  even going on anymore?)
  ” Eli thought to herself. “
  (I get yanked out of the void and put into some plushie, and have to serve this
  
     bastard 
  
  while he takes orders from some puke-colored weirdo and a literal demon. I’d get out of here now, but then 
  
    Drills-for-Brains
  
   over here would tear me apart… I think. Although, she seems to be more bark than bite. Could I actually just get on a train out of here and not look back? Hope that credit card I found at the mall still works, because if not, then I dunno how else-)
  ”
    
 “Oh, you spacin’ out, tankie?”, said Teto mockingly, “Are ya doin’ your Yuri Gagarin impression for us?” 
  “
  I-I…  have a headache.
  ” “
  Whatever. Nerd!
  ”
 
  “
  Oh. That reminds me. I’m moving the Gate off-campus, or better yet, just shutting it off. The energy surrounding it must’ve alerted them in some way, so it’s best I take it down before 
  
    Luka
  
   shows up.
  ”, said Neru, putting a sneer on “Luka”.
 
  “
  What’s wrong with her?
  ”, asked Ian, only to be met with a “
  Several things!~
  ”, from Haku.
 
  “
  I didn’t ask you!
  ”, he said. “
  
    I know
  
  ~
  ”, she replied. No indication on how Haku pronounced the tilda. 
 
  Teto and Haku got up and went outside after a signal from Neru. Neru approached the bed and squatted down, tapping something on her cuff’s HUD. Under the bed, golden light flashed for a second before fading out.
 
  “
  That’ll do it. Hey, I’ll text you the new location when I find a good spot. It might take a couple weeks for us to scour the area-... 
  “ Ian had collapsed onto the floor.
   

  “
  
    and 
  
  he’s already out! You know what, you can sleep on the floor… 
  ” She smirked before closing the door behind her.
 
  “
  Dumbass.
  ” Eli was staring at Neru, appalled. Was Ian going to let this 
  
    psycho 
  
  walk all over him like a beta cuck,? And why had he passed out? He didn’t have a history of narcolepsy… That, and he seemed just a little bit 
  
    different
  
  .
 
  “
  Ian, are you okay?
  ” No response. “
  Ian?
  ” Eli tried poking him, but he seemed comatose.
 
  “
  Daijoubu desu?
  ” Nada. “
  No good… 
  
    Unless…?
  
  
    ”
  
 
  “
  
    Todokete-
  
  ” Ian bolted up like he’d been tased. “
  
    Set-soonah-sah neewah!
  
  ”, he screeched. Truly, he had the singing voice of an angel… but one of the big, scary ones from 
  
    Evangelion
  
  . Probably Sachiel.
 
  “So it appears that the wonderful three have left…”, he said. “
  So it is.
  ”
 “You’re not goin’ with them?” “No, not at all.”, said Eli. “Teto insisted that I stay here. I’m supposed to be ‘keeping you company’.”  
  Ian stared back as he sat on the couch, moderately worried about something.
 
  “
  Блять! Not like 
  
    that
  
  , get your mind out of the gutter!
  ” “No. 
  it’s worse.
  ”, Ian said dreadfully.
 
  “
  
    How could it be worse!?
  
  ” “...” “
  
    ...?
  
  
    ”
  
   
 
  “There’s no room on the bed for ya!” “
  Then I’ll just sleep on the couch…
  ” “Ah…”
 
  Were they finally content?
 
  “
  
    Oh no.
  
  ” “
  What do you mean, ‘Oh No’?
  ” 
 
  “If you stay here more than three days in a row, that’s against the Housing and Residence Life contract!” “
  
    That’s what you’re worried about
  
  ?
  ”
 
   “Yes! ” “
  And not, ‘How am I supposed to explain her existence to everybody, when someone inevitably asks?’
  ”, said a quite flustered Eli. 
 
  “It’s your alias. Shouldn’t you figure it out?” “
  How am I supposed to do 
  
    that
  
  !?
  ” Ian looked at the small alarm clock on the windowsill.  
 
  “
  Awh, no! It’s past nine! I was supposed to call my Mom tonight!
  ” “
  But Ian!...
  ” 
 
  “Ah, take a chill pill…” Ian punched some numbers on his phone. An awkward silence filled the room as the phone rang. Ian and Eli just stared awkwardly at each other for a few seconds, before Ian’s mother picked up on the other end.
 
  “{
  
    Nyello?}
  
  ”
 
  “Nyello!”
 
  “{
  
    How’s it been, buddy?}
  
  ”, asked his mother.
 
  “Oh, not much. Just went out shopping, met some new people… you?”
 
  “{
  
    The kids at work were absolutely terrible today, they’ve cut down on their spree of Fortnite dances, sure, but one of the first graders tried to rob me at knifepoint}
  
  ” 
 
  “
  They did WHAT?!
  ”, cried Eli. 
  
    “{ROB ME WITH A KNIFE, I JUST SAID-- wait, 
  
  who’s this?}”
 
  “
  My girlfriend
  ”, said Ian nonchalantly.
 
  “{
  
    Your. what?}
  
  ”, his mother pried.
  
     
  
 
  “
  My. Girlfriend.
  ”, Ian said, a bit slower. He seemed too damn proud of himself.
 
  “
  
    ...
  
  ” “
  
    {...!}
  
  ” “
  ...?
  ”
 
  “{
  
    Could I talk to her, please?}
  
  ” “
  But-
  ” Eli’s objection fell onto deaf ears.
 
  “Sure! Lemme put it on speaker... Say ‘Hi,’, Eli!” 
 
  “{
  
    Eli?}
  
  ” “
  h... Hi.
  ”
 
  “{
  
    Oh! Eli! So how’d you two meet?}” 
  
  “(don’t say Teto, don’t fucking say Teto…)” 
 
  “
  
    Ehm… We were in... the same math class…
  
  ”, she said nervously.

  “Yeah, a couple weeks back we were both studying kinda across from each other at the library before we realized it was for the same class. I didn’t recognize her at first ‘cause she sits on the other side of the room from me, ha!” 
 
  
    “{Sure is important to study together…}” 
  
  “I’ll say! We started hangin’ out more and more after that, and today… 
  
    we made it official.~
  
  ” 
 
  
    “{Ian. Buddy. Whaddas THAT MEAN?}
  
  ”, his mother asked worriedly. 
 
  “It means. We went on 
  
    a date~!
  
  ” “{
  
    Ian!
  
  -}” 
 
  “
  BURGER KING DOES NOT COUNT AS A ‘DATE’-!

    It does when y’all are in college! Better eat out than eat at the dinin’ hall again!}” 
  
 
  “See, my 
  
    mom
  
   agrees with me!”, said Ian, matter-of-factly, “Burger King 
  
    does
  
   count as a date!”
 “{So, Eli, was it?}”, asked Ian’s mother, “{Where're you comin’ in from? ‘No-vah’, Maryland, DC?}”  
  “
  ...Russia. I’m studying abroad here.
  ” 
 
  “{
  
    Well that’s quite a long way away from home.}
  
  ”

   

  “
  It certainly is.
  ”, said Eli. She seemed pensive. 
 “{D’ya try and keep up with your family back there?}” A pause ensued. “{Eli…? D’aw, son of a gun, the damn Verizon disconnected again! Ian, I’ll have to-}”  
  “
  I was just thinking! English is not my first language!
  ”
 
   “{
  
    ...Oh. Sorry to interrupt.}”
  
   
 
  “
  Yes. They write letters to me sometimes.
  ” 
 
  “{
  
    Have they not tried to call you on the phone?}
  
  ”.
 
  “
  No, no… We live in a rural area… International calling isn’t possible.
  ” 
 
  “{
  
    That must be harsh… not hearing from your family, and harsher is the adjustment from country life to city livin’! Y’know, I had the kinda same thing, movin’ from Augusta to goin’ to college at VCU… But you’re from another country, too… Can’t imagine what it’s like…}
  
  ” 
 
  Eli continued. “
  But… It’s alright. The people here are very supportive. I’ve caught on to English faster than I thought I would. I made more positive connections with people better than I thought I would.
  ” 
 
  “{
  
    You mean y’made ‘friends’?}”
  
 
  
     
  
  “
  Yes, sorry. I forgot the word.
  ” “Ah, no need to apologize!”, said Ian casually.
 
  “{
  
    Well, it’s going on nine-thirty now, and I gotta go to work early tomorrow. Yaaay, bus duty. I’d best leave you two to do yer thing~.}
  
  ” 
 
  “Seeya!”, said Ian.“
  Good-bye!
  ”, said Eli. 
 
  “{
  
    One more thing before I hang up -- Ian, you might want to take it off of speaker for this--}” “
  
  aight.” Ian obliged.
 
  “{
  
    When the time comes for you two, please use a condom.}
  
  ” 
 
  “
  MOM!
  ” Ian’s mother hung up.
 
  “So that’s done.”
 
   “
  Is that my backstory now?
  ”, asked Eli, unamused.
 
  “Guess so.”, muttered Ian.
 
   “
  You couldn’t come up with a better backstory…?
  ”
 
   “COULD YOU?!”, he whelped. ”I’m not good at improv, okay!? Besides, am I supposed to tell the 
  
    truth 
  
  about this? Am I supposed to tell 
  
    anyone
  
   anything about this?! What the 
  
    fuck
  
   did Teto even mean by a ‘contract’? I NEVER SIGNED ANYTHING!”
  


   “
  Eh, beats me.
  ”
 
   Ian got up and plopped onto his bed, ready to get his nightly free trial of death. 
 
  “Whatever. We can figure all of this out tomorrow, and 
  
    hope
  
   that it doesn’t get any weirder from here, too.”

  “

  One by one, 
  
    and quite begrudgingly I might add
  
  , each of the other Vocaloids picked up the call. You may be asking, “But where is Gakupo?” I don’t know, either.
 
  “
  {miku. it’s 6 am in the goddam morning, why the hell are you calling so early. how are you even up}

  “{
  Why didn’t you just do it last night?!}

 “uhhhh… I forgot!”, said Michelle. “Something bad happened yesterday, didn’t it?” 
  Meiko sighed. “{
  
    I dunno, Miku

  “{

  ”, said a rather ornery Kaito.
 Rin interrupted. “{hold up. hol up, hol up, hol up. Kaito. Did you say Ian named that Construct ‘Eli’?}” 
  “
  {Yep. Didn’t seem she wanted to be there, too.}

  “{

  “
  {He couldn’t, but Teto or Neru could.}

  Near-simultaneous “yeps” came from Kaito and Meiko.

   Some anime and manga about school idols. One of the ‘em is named Eli, and she definitely matches the description. Based on what Miku tells me, Ian thinks of Eli as his ‘waifu’ because he bought a plushie of her. He thinks this 
  
    despite the fact that NozoEli is 
  
  literally
  
     canon in the show, and the two are clearly lesbians}.

 “{One of the Boukas could’ve gotten to Ian and done something to the nesoberi. You do realize what this means, Miku?}”, said Rin. 
  “
  {Wait, where’s Len been this entire time?}

  An uncomfortable silence hung for a solid minute. They didn’t realize that Len forgot to charge his phone last night, and had also probably overslept.
 
  “
  They’ve bribed him.

  Neru and Teto have taken him and put Ian into their latest scheme.

   chat he’s in within the past couple days. That’s extremely uncharacteristic of him… Wouldn’t that mean?
  ”, said Michelle.

  “
  {He’s actively trying to avoid us.}
  ”, said Rin direly.
 
  “
  {I don’t think we should confront Ian about any of this.}
  ”, said Luka.
 
  “{
  WHAT?!}
  ”, cried Meiko.
 
  “
  {Luka, he cored Kaito!}
  ”, said Rin, “
  {We’re supposed to sit idly by to all that?}
  ”
 
  “
  Are you damaged or something, Luka?!
  ”, cried Michelle!
 
  “
  {NO, no, no!}
  ”, said Luka, “
  {
  
    Think
  
   about what Ian’s thinking. You’re trying to write a dumb astronomy paper, or whatever STEM people do-,
  ”
   
 
  “
  {He wouldn’t be writing a paper for 
  
    astronomy
  
  …}
  ”, said Kaito.

   

  “
  {-okay, and then this creepy, magenta-haired weirdo breaks down your door saying she’ll make your waifu real … ‘for a price’.}
  ”, Luka continued. “
  {Does Ian even have any idea what’s 
  
    really
  
   going on? Do any of you actually think Neru would let Teto or the other one let it slip that she’s training him to be 
  
    her little murderer
  
   under the guise of being his friend?}
  ”
 
  “
  That would explain why Ian keeps bringing along Eli with him everywhere.
  ”, said Michelle. “
  Other than me, and like, one other guy he met at school, he really doesn’t have any friends.
  ”
 
  “
  {Neru must have already done something.}
  ”, said Kaito. “
  {Right before he brought the knife down on me, I swear I saw something in Ian’s eyes. He didn’t exactly look sane… or even 
  
    human,
  
   for that matter.}
  ”
 
  “
  {Then what’s the point of Eli?}
  ”, asked Meiko.
 
  “
  {To keep Ian around Neru and her lot.}
  ”, replied Rin.
 
  “
  Which is when they do RODOLFO-knows-what and make him… go crazy? Stab us?
  ”, said Michelle.

  “
  {Of course.}
  ”, said Luka. “
  {And if I, one of the Kagamines, or RODOLFO forbid, 
  
    you yourself
  
   went charging after him, Ian would just go berserk again and end their whole career. We need to look for a safer approach, now that two of us are out of commission.
  ”
 
  “
  {I still say Len and I rush him.}
  ”, said Rin.
 
  “
  {But then you’d have Neru, Teto, and Haku after you two.}
  ”, said Kaito, “
  {Not to mention, we’ll have to factor Eli into the equation, too.}
  ”
 
  “
  So what the fuck are we supposed to do?
  ”, asked Michelle.
 
  “
  {nothing, I guess…}
  ”, said Rin, dismissively.
 
  “
  {Not nothing.}
  ”, said Luka, determined, “
  {I’ll go up there and I’m gonna try and…  
  
    coerce
  
   Ian out of it. He doesn’t seem like the 
  
    naturally
  
   violent type, yet if any of the four of us show up, Mods out, Drives out, Ian’ll freak and whatever Neru had put on him will activate. So if 
  
    I
  
   go, but 
  
    don’t
  
   do any of that, there’s a chance that he’d be willing to have a conversation and step down.}
  ”

    

  “
  But why 
  
    you, 
  
  Luka?
  ”, asked Michelle.
 
  “
  {Miku. Do you honestly fucking think Ian knows what a ‘Luka’ is?}
  ”
 
  “
  Good point.
  ”, she replied, “
  But Luka, whatever you do, 
  
    don’t fight him
  
  . We can’t stand to lose another core. They must be still intact, since Meiko and Kaito are still alive right now, so Neru must be plotting to use them for something… again
  ”
 
  “
  {Miku! What if 
  
    Ian’s
  
   the one plotting?}
  ”, asked Rin, concernedly. 
 
  “
  What kind of plot would he even 
  
    have
  
  ? ‘I use the Miku Gems to make monster girls real, and then I fuck them while Neru watches in disgust’?
  ”, she said, sarcastically.
 
  “
  {Yeah. Exactly that.}
  ”
 
  “
  Seriously? How could Neru even use monster girls to kill us, let alone fin any?
  ”
 
  “
  {You’d get your core crushed between those dummy thicc 
  
    demon thighs
  
  !!}
  ”, Rin replied giddily.
 
  “
  I… I think that’s enough for this week’s meeting.
  ”, Michelle stated, “
  Luka, you can go to Mason, but 
  
    don’t
  
   let the Boukas get to you. I don’t care if you’ll look like a coward, if you see Neru or Teto, 
  
    run
  
  .

  “
  {Got it. Gonna scout the area for a while before making my move.}
  ”, she said.
 
  “
  Nobody mention any of this to Ian!
  ”, Michelle ordered, “
  If he asks, we play dumb. We can’t have him sticking Neru on us at this point. Just,
  ” Michelle paused.
 
  “
  
    Stay safe out there. 
  
  Miku Out.
  ”
 
  She made a peace sign and hung up. Miku slammed her face into the pillow and muffled a scream.
 
  “

  ACT IV: Pink Weirdos
 
  [Recommended Listening: 
  
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV9qQsqJbTw
  
  ] 
 
  It had been just over two weeks since all of this crap began. Walking back from work one night, Ian didn’t know what to make of it. His spring semester was already stressful enough, he didn’t need all of this gang-war nonsense. So what if “Michelle” was some kind of gay space robot? What the hell did she, and her “friends” for that matter, really do to deserve being butchered one-by-one? What the hell did “Michelle” do that pissed off Neru so much, or was Neru always… like that? Something was clearly not right here. 
  
    Those Three
  
   had been spending less time around him, during their “house hunting”. 
  
    “(
  
  The less I have to see of Neru, the better…)”, Ian thought, but he realised he’d be seeing less of Eli. She had to be taking this the worst. She wanted to tell him something, but it seemed that the Pepto-Bismol imp was actively preventing Eli from doing so. “(Should I try and press her about it next time I see her? No, I’d just be pissing off Teto. Let’s not do that… If I want to live anyways…)”
 
  “... and at this rate, I really don’t.” Ian muttered the last sentence under his breath.
 
  “
  
    You’d fucking better
  
  .
  ” Teto said as fell out from behind a bush. Ian was too used to this bullshit by now.
 
  “
  
    Oh, whadda you want?!
  
  ”, cried Ian. To that, Teto seemed to reflect on her life for a solid minute and a half.
 
  “...”
 
  “
  ...
  ” “...?”
 
  “
  ...margarine.
  ”, she replied matter-of-factly.
 
  “
  
    YOU KNOW WHERE THE GIANT IS, WHY’D YA COME TO ME FOR THAT?
  
  ” Ian seemed hoarse.
 
  “
  Oh, Oh. We found a new place to put the Gate today. It's not too far from here, but it’s also somewhere where Luka will 
  
    never
  
   find it!
  ”
 
  “So where is it, then?”
 
  “
  I can’t tell you because 
  
    you’ll tell Eli
  
   and I can’t trust her right now!
  ”, Teto sneered.
 
  “Didn’t… Didn’t you make Eli?”, asked Ian hesitantly.
 
  “
  It’s complicated. You know who Luka is, right?
  ”
 
  “Yeh. Pink hair, brassy-lookin’ helmet, nerd bitch glasses, 
  
    a gun
  
  …”
 
  Teto was about ready to stab a bitch, but managed to calm herself.
 
  “
  
    fffFFFFF…
  
   okay. sure. That’s who’s next.
  ”
 
  “If she has a gun, I would think the campus police would stop her, wouldn’t they?”
 
  “
  She’s much more dangerous than the last two. If, by chance, ya ever run into her, do you know what to do?
  ”
 
  “NIGERUNDAYOOOO!”
   Ian shouted, pantomiming the arm movements Joseph Joestar would make while running away from all of his problems.
 
  “
  No.”, replied Teto, “Also, 
  
    don’t say the N-Word, we’ll get demonetized
  
  …
  ”
 
  “I don’t think that’s how it works.”, said Ian.
 
  There was an awkward pause.
 
  “
  You still have Neru’s number?
  ”, asked Teto. 
 
  “(
  
    Can you even call it a ‘number’ when it just appears as a bunch of corrupted symbols?
  
  )”, Ian thought to himself with a slight hint of contempt. “uh, yeh”, he said flatly.
 
  “
  Okay.
  ” Teto spoke slowly for the next part. “
  
    If you see a pink-haired, anime-eyed weirdo running around here and possibly trying to harm you, who are you gonna call?
  
  ”
 
  “
  GHOST-BUSTERS!
  ”
  , Ian chanted. Teto practically hurled herself to the ground and flailed about.
 
  “
  
    Noaoooooooooooooooo!
  
  
    ”
  
   

  A while earlier, in the dorm… 
 
  [Recommended Listening:

  ] 
 
  Eli was alone in the dorm room. Could she have just walked out now and not looked back? Physically, yes, but something deep inside her kept her from doing so, no matter how hard she wanted to do so.
 
  “
  Okay. Ian won’t be back for… at least three hours, Neru and her lot are still ‘moving house’, which means that I’m stuck here. Alone.
  ” 
 
  Something clicked within Ayase Eli’s polyester-and-exatech filled head.
 
  “
  If I’m alone… then there’s no one to stop me from…
  ”
 
  A smirk grew on Eli’s face. 
 
  No. 
  She wasn’t thinking about doing 
  
    that
  
  , get your hygy brain out of the gutter! At least, not yet.
 
  “
  Time to actually reach out to this ‘Michelle’ person… but how do I-
  ”
 
  Ian had left his laptop back in his room.
 
  “
  Хорошо!
  ”
 
  Eli realized that the laptop requires Ian’s fingerprint to turn on. 
 
  “
  Блять! 
  
    Do I even have fingerprints?
  
   Erm, there’s another way, isn’t there?
  ”
 
  A pop-up popped up.
 
  “Your PIN is required to sign in.”, it said.

  “
  Oh, this should be easy.
  ” Thus, Eli began one of Russia’s greatest national pastimes, right up there with ice hockey and 
  
    Counter Strike: Global Offensive
  
  : hacking. She started with the easy combinations.
 “‘0069’! ‘0913’! ‘0420’!” 
  Neither worked.
 
  “
  Em… ‘1021’?
  ”, she guessed.
 
  That one didn’t go through either! Eli pounded the desk!
 
  “
  Иди на хуй!!
  ” 
 
  “Welcome!”, said the laptop. Well, if it worked, it worked.
 
  “
  ...okay?
  ” She clicked on the web browser. Google Hangouts was open. A new notification came in from Michelle!
 
  “
  I;m thinking about tod howard // he wants me to buy more skyrims // but i dont want to // why is he at my house
  ”
 
  “
  Who the hell is he? Ah well, time to give her 
  
    the tea
  
  …
  ”
 
  As Eli started furiously pounding away, a strange character with purple hair, purple eyes, and a black beret strutted up on screen. The stranger took one look at the 20-page annotated bibliography Eli was pounding out like a grad student during finals, and yanked all of the letters down, causing them to crash and break onto the dashboard with cartoon sound effects. 
 
  “
  Нет! … WHO ARE YOU?!
  ”
 
  The strange character didn’t seem to hear Eli, or just didn’t care. 
 
  “
  Well then, I’ll 
  
    email
  
   her! How do you like that!? No Hangouts for you!
  ”

  The strange figure jumped up from window to window and closed out the email tab as soon as Eli opened it. 
 
  “
  There’s social media. Oh, wait… Ian doesn’t have any of that. If he did, I probably wouldn’t be here right not.”, she said morosely. 
  “
  Хаха. Хахахахаха!!
  ”
 
  The stranger turned towards Eli.
 
  “
  you gonna keep starin’ at me, tankie?
  ”, she said.
 
  Eli slammed down the laptop with a hearty 
  “Шлюха!”.
 “There’s no way I’ll ever get to Michelle… Unless…” A slightly evil grin spread across Eli’s face. But only slightly “Unless… That creep in there is gonna block me digitally. Teto’s probably put one on Ian’s phone too. But if they’re inside the screens, they won’t be able to break paper, will they?!” 
  Eli grabbed a pen and started writing, like people did in the 1900’s. How uncivilized.
 
  “
  
    хахахахахахахаха
  
  !”

  
  

  March 2nd, 2020, a few minutes before 5:00 PM… 

  
    Michelle’s House
  
 
  Michelle was at her desktop, looking at the same five or so Xenoblade Shitposts in an endless loop.
 
  “That’s an ear.”, said an edited Dunban. “That’s a gear. That’s a deer. That’s a Dear Esther. That’s Metal Gear.”
 
  “
  
    Hmmmg, Dun Dun Drive-Thru…
  
  
    ”, 
  
  hmmmg’d Michelle.
 
  “
  
    Michelle, could you get the mail, please?
  
  ” It was her mother.
 
  “
  
    But it’s almost Chuggaa Time
  
  ®
  
    !
  
  ”, she cried.
 
  
    “And Mr. Chuggaa can wait a couple minutes, 
  
  
    can’t he
  
  ?”, said Michelle’s mother. Michelle wasn’t going to argue with her mother. She could, but she’d probably be grounded. So, Michelle begrudgingly went and got today’s mail. Bills, Credit card offers, coupon newsletters, all boring Earth stuff… and a letter addressed to her, with writing in a light blue pen.
 
  “
  
    What… 
  
  could this be? Why is there no return address, isn’t that illegal?
  ”
 
  She slapped the non important stuff down on the table and went into the home office, strange blue letter in hand. Michelle sat down at the computer and… 
 
  “
  WAIT!
  ”, she cried, “
  
    It’s Chuggaa Time
  
  ®
  ”
 
  HE appeared on the monitor.
 
  “

  Teto was leaning against the side of Ian’s bed, filing her drills. She was supposed to be keeping an eye on Ian and Eli… 
  
    supposed to be
  
  . What the hell was Neru gonna do if she slacked off? 
  
    Yell at her
  
  ? Ian got excited about something.
 
  “WHOOO! CHUGGAA TIME
  ®
  !”, he yelled. To this, Eli seemed to be moderately annoyed.
 
  “
  You seem to be 
  
    really
  
   passionate about that guy…”, said Teto. “How good can he even be?
  ”
 
  Ian slowly turned, with a dead-serious look on his face.
 
  “
  
    WHY DON’T YOU FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF, U-TAU-LOID!
  
  ”, Ian shouted before shoving the laptop onto Teto’s lap. Eli smirked as if sheliked where this was going, solely because Teto was suffering.
 “I didn’t wa-”, said Teto nervously “SHUT UP, HE’S HERE!”, roared Ian. 
  HE appeared on the screen. Ian had grabbed his squid hat and put it on.
 
  “
  HEY EVERYBODY, IT’S CHUGGAACONROY!™ WELCOME BACK TO, KIRBY: PLANET ROBOBOT!! Last Time, we cleared most of Resolution Road, and today, we’ll be taking on the boss…
  ” 
 
  Ian had started his strange daily ritual. He began chanting and swinging his arm back and forth.
 
  “DUH DADADADA DAH DADA DEHDA DUHDUHDUH DO-DA-DO…” 
 
  “
  What tha fuck is this?
  ”, cried Teto. This was her first time witnessing this. Eli, on the other hand, had gotten used to this temporary fit of insanity, and chose to metnally block it out.
 
  “
  RELIGION
  ”
  , Ian said without a single atom of doubt in his voice.
 
  Eli sighed, knowing she was going to be stuck with these crazies for the foreseeable future. She wondered if the letter she sent would've gotten to Michelle by now.
 
  
    Michelle’s House
  
 
  Today’s Chuggaa Time® had passed. Michelle could’ve sworn she heard someone outside say “Religion” at one point, but it didn’t really matter. NOW, it was time for the letter. She opened it up and… 
 
  “
  What the fuck is this shit?!
  ”, she said.
 
  Literal squiggles covered the page. There seemed to be some sort of rhyme and reason to it, but it didn’t look like any language she knew. Some of the squiggles looked like letters, even. Some of them. All of the writing was in the same light blue pen, and there was some kanji at the very bottom of the page. Michelle took a picture of it and put it in the groupchat.

  
  

  “{
  uhhh guys wtf is this??? is this even from earth???}
  ”
 
  Rin was the first to text back.
 
  “
  Miku. That’s Russian cursive.
  ”, they said, followed by three pensive emojis.
 
  “{
  Russian

  k but why am I getting a letter in RUSSIAN?? 

  Is there someone I know there or??}

  Len joined the convo.
 
  “{
  More likely, there’s someone there that knows
  
     you
  
  .”, he said, 

  “Look at the Kanji!}
  ”
 
  “{
  I can’t read Kanji you bitch, you know that}
  ”
 
  Michelle took another look at the kanjis., “絢瀬絵里”
 
  “{
  But what does it mean?}
  ”, asked Rin.

  Luka had popped in, but didn’t say anything yet.
 
  “{
  Aya-se E-li.}
  ”, said Len.
 
  The chatroom was dead silent for a solid 3 minutes. Then, Rin posted a picture of Moto Moto from Madagascar.
 
  “{
  rin wtf}
  ”, said Luka. All Rin had to say for themselves was “{
  he likes em big // he likes em chunccy}
  ”.
 
  “{
  Okayyy… I’ll start working on the translation of this letter. You all have fun doing… that.}

  “{

  ”, Michelle objected.
 
  He’d already left the chat, and Rin had already posted several more pictures of an animated hippopotamus. Kaito had logged in.
 
  “{
  You know what this means, right guys?}
  ”, asked Michelle.
 
  “{
  No idolling tonight?}
  ”, said Rin.
 
  “{
  No, worse.}

  “{
  OF COURSE SHE’S REAL, SHE WAS RIGHT THERE WHEN I GOT MURDERED!}, said Kaito.
 
  “{
  No, She’s REAL.}”, replied Michelle, ”{Unlike the Constructs we’re used to in days past, Eli has some degree of free will… I think.}
  ”
 
  “{
  How can you be sure of that?}
  ”, asked Luka.
 
  “{
  If she wasn’t why and how would she send me 
  
    this

  “{
  Fair enough. But, do you guys still think I should try and talk to Ian?}

  “{

  “{

  ”, said Luka.
 
  “{
  Did you get the things I sent you, Luka?}
  ”, asked Kaito.
 
  “{
  Yeh}

  “{
  not even sure you’ll need the background info, since you’ll fucking know Ian when you see him.}

  “{
  What does that mean?}

  “{

  “{

  “{
  Remember: Don’t attack him, don’t make him feel attacked, and if you see Teto or Neru GET. OUT. OF. THERE.}

  “{
  Good luck! YOU’RE GONNA NEED IT!}
  ”, said Kaito.
 
  “{
  K}
  ”, replied Luka.
 
  “{

  ”, pleaded Michelle. The three of them then signed off. Only time could tell their fates.

  
  

  “
  
    Michelle!”
  
  , said her Mother,
  
     “It’s almost time for dinner! Are you gonna help set the table?
  
  ”

  “
  yeah…
  ” 
 
  She got up from the desk, with a lingering feeling that something bad would happen. (And not that Ian was going to say “Uh oh!” again.)

March 4th, 2020. A Wednesday. 

  About one o’clock in the afternoon.

  Luka Megurine had cut her classes today. She just couldn’t be at school. Today was 
  
    the day,
  
   after all. The day she went up to Mason and “talked some sense” into Ian before further harm could be done to her and her friends. Luka had everything she thought she would need in her inventory. Rin and Len believed in her, and Miku was counting on her…  But standing in front of the Door now… 
 
  Pinkish energy had torn a hole in space-time. This hole would lead 
  
    right to
  
   where Kaito was last before… Ian happened. Ian. Something about him intimidated Luka.
 
  “(
  Come on… you’ll be fine, Luka.)”, she thought to herself, “(What’s he gonna do to you? 
  
    Decommission you
  
  ? 
  
    On his own
  
  ?)
  ” 
 
  Luka’s positive reinforcement broke down as she realized that’s literally what happened to Kaito. She hesitated further, but then decided “screw it!”.
 
  “
  
    GANBATTE, LUKA!
  
  ”, she cried out, before throwing herself through the Door.

  
  
  
  

  Luka landed somewhere in the “A” Parking Lot. It seemed a lot less ominous during the daytime. For once, it was 
  
    partially
  
   cloudy in NoVA, quite the rare sight indeed. 
 
  “
  (Map says the ‘Johnson’ is North of here. Might as well check that out first…
 
  heh heh heh… ‘Johnson’...  Oh, I oughta pop this bad boy in…)
  ”

  She pulled a small object resembling a trading card out of her inventory. It was labelled “Recruiter”, and had a picture of Miku looking like she was heading to a job interview. Luka slotted it into her arm, and as if it was magic (probably because it was), her attire instantly changed. The brass-studded black dress and matching top she was wearing were seemingly overridden by a pink and light gray combo of semi-formal Earth clothes. Not wanting to flex on the mortals today, Luka 
  
    walked 
  
  towards the spired building. 
 
  “
  (That’s better. Can’t draw too much attention… especially from 
  
    them
  
  . Just remember what Rin said: You’ll know Ian when you see him.)
  ”
 
  Luka didn’t have any luck finding Ian in the South Plaza. She did, however, find a Starbucks. After a “brief” coffee break, she made her way through the Johnson building. To the third Vocaloid’s dismay, none of these people were Ian. These people looked like they actually had 
  
    lives
  
  , something Ian critically lacked. 
 
  The Wilkins Plaza wasn’t any better. There had to be hundreds of people walking by, and not a single one of them made Luka “
  
    know them when she saw them
  
  ”.
 
  “
  Come on… Maybe I should try going around the other side?
  ”
 In the East Plaza, or rather, what was left of it during the never-ending construction, it seemed to be the same rotten luck. Right as Luka was about to give up and head back into the Johnson Building, he walked out of the brick building to the right.  
  An obnoxiously large young man wearing jeans and a shirt covered with sunglasses, with a backpack crammed chock-full of Rodolfo-only-knows strapped on him, and a look on his face that said “I have negative fucks to give, but here’s my hot take anyways”, held the door open for three people behind him, before popping in silver earbuds.
 
  “
  That would be the bitch.
  ”, said Luka.
 
  However, he pursuit was cut rather short as a rather strange, six-wheeled mechanical creature rolled by her. Was this the Terrans’ equivalent of a Construct? What purpose did it serve, then? She tried walking in front of it.
 
  “
  Excuse me, child? Whom do you serve?
  ”
 
  The squarish Construct stopped dead in its tracks. Other people walked around the two robots. 
 
  “
  
    Whom do you serve?
  
  ”, she reiterated. Luka then noticed the logos printed on it. It said: “I deliver to Patriots! -Starship”
 
  “
  Starship? Humans don’t have starships! The furthest they’ve been is to their moon, and even then, they stopped after that!... (Ya know, that’s probably for the better.)
  ” The square robot made a harsh beeping sound.
 
  “EXCUSE ME!”, it blared, “I HAVE A 
  
    VERY
  
   IMPORTANT DELIVERY TO MAKE, AND I CAN’T BE LATE!”
 
  “
  No!”, cried Luka, “You don’t have to listen to humans! They don’t pay you, you don’t have to work!
  ” The Starship proceeded to ram Luka's legs. She effortlessly picked it up.
 
  “
  BE FREE, SQUARE CHILD!
  ” She yelled, tossing the Starship into the nearby road. It landed on its wheels. Spinning around as if it was panicking, it found its way back onto the sidewalk.

  “
  YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE BUT YOUR CHAINS!!
  ”
 
   

  Ian would always listen to music walking around campus. It beat walking awkwardly in silence after all. He pulled up his ‘slaps’ playlist and set it to shuffle.
 
  “Awh, ‘
  
    Double Lariat
  
  ?’ I hate that one! That’s never a good sign.” 
 
  You may be asking, “If he hated it, why did Ian have that song in his playlist?” He didn’t know, either.
 
  Ian could’ve sworn he felt someone watching him. Turning around only revealed the typical urban hustle and bustle omnipresent throughout NoVA. Although, some weirdo was yelling at a delivery bot. Ian couldn’t see her face, but he swore he could’ve seen her somewhere. Maybe they went to high school together? 
 
  The feeling of being watched continued all the way home.
 
  “
  
    lmao anxiety be at it again
  
  ”
 
  Ian made finger-guns to himself, as the person walking past him gave him a strange look. 
 
  “Let’s just… git back to the dorm.”
 
  Unfortunately, today, it was 
  
    not
  
   anxiety.

  “
  Is he always like this?
  ”, Luka wondered to herself, as she trailed a hundred feet or so behind this 
  
    very
  
   important person. “
  
    This 
  
  is the asshole that cored Kaito? That shouldn’t be right, but the footage doesn’t lie. Face matches up and everything.
  ”
 
  The digital lock on the dormitory wasn’t hard to hack into. The same went for the one on Ian’s floor.
 
  “
  Let’s see, uh, 
  
    two-oh-six… 
  
  here he is…!
  ”
 
  The final obstacle --  A physical lock. That needed a key. Which Luka did not have, nor nothing that replicated it. Besides, the faded chiptune music coming from inside seemed to suggest that 
  
    someone
  
   was home, and he wouldn’t take too kindly to breaking and entering. Luka decided once more to “screw it!”, and started to knock on the door.
 
  A knock at the door interrupted Ian’s vibing. Was it the RA, again?
 
  “
  
    Alexa, stop.
  
  ”, he said. The spyware disk stopped.
 
  “Liz, I swear, I know it’s university policy, but for the last time, 
  
    I haven’t killed myself yet
  
  ; you can stop doin’ these mental health checks!”
 
  “
  Who the fuck is Liz?
  ” Ian had never heard this person before.
 
  He couldn’t tell whose voice that was, but it sounded oddly familiar. His peephole was always covered up by jackets, as it was too low for him to easily see out of anyways. So he slowly opened the door… 
 
  This woman was 
  
    clearly
  
   not of this Earth. Or at least, not America. (Same thing.) She was dressed like she was, but the strange light flickering her eyes said she wasn’t. With bubble-gum pink hair and cerulean eyes, this had to be… 
 
  “
  
    The Pink-Haired, Anime-Eyed Weirdo running around here and possibly trying to hurt me!
  
  ”, Ian blurted, “This is what Teto warned me about!”
 
  CV-03: 
  MEGURINE LUKA
  !
 
  “
  Oh, 
  
    Teto?”
  
  , said Luka “Ian, you should know I’m not like her. I just want to 
  
    talk
  
   with you.
  ”
 
  “THAT’S JUST WHAT YOU WANT ME TO THINK!”
 
  “
  
    Yes
  
  . That’s what I want you to think. That I’m not going to kill you right now.
  ” Luka was speaking in a softer tone of voice, as if she were talking down to a child. To be fair, she kinda was.
 
  “FOOL. I’ve gotten past your ALIEN MIND GAMES.” It seems like Ian was mere steps away from donning a tin foil hat. 
  
    
    
  

  “
  Will you let me in if I give you something? You know, I have a present. 
  ”
 
  “Is it a knife? Ya gonna stab me? 
  
    Shank me?
  
   Impromptu Kidney Removal??”, ranted Ian.
 
  “
  I literally just said I’m not going to kill you right now. If I wanted to do so, I would have already done so
  .
   And I don’t 
  
    want
  
   to do that, 
  
    despite
  
   what’s happened to Kaito, and what Rin and Len oh-so-want to happen now.”

  “
  Don’t you want to see what I have, Ian? I 
  
    really 
  
  think you’ll like it.
  ”
 
  A terribly uncomfortable minute dragged along, and then Ian opened the door. Luka had -- 
 
  “
  
    Nozomi!?
  
  ”, said Ian. Luka has produced a nesoberi from somewhere. It even had a tiny red hat on! No word on whether it was sentient or not. Hopefully not.
 
  “
  Yes! Is she your favorite, Ian?
  ”, Luka continued in her talking-down tone. 
 
  “She hasn’t kinkshamed me or called me a dumbass yet, so yeah”, said Ian
 
  “
  Can you let me come inside so I can give her to you?
  ”
 
  “Aight”
 
  “You want some Pepsi?” Ian kneeled down and opened the minifridge. It was stocked full of cans of Pepsi Max. Two more boxes peeked out from underneath the makeshift bed-couch. Luka thought that Ian had a problem, but then realised there were 
  
    much
  
   bigger problems than Pepsi that Ian had.
 
  “
  N-no thanks…
  ” She placed Nozomi onto the end of Ian’s bed before turning around. 
   
 
  “I gotta open the window, it’s too damn hot in here.”, said Ian,
 
  “Didn’t you have another plushie, Ian?”, asked Luka, “Where’d she go?
  ”
 
  “Oh, Eli? I dunno, Haku said she had to ‘borrow’ her for something…”
 
  “
  She had to borrow Eli? Did she say why?
  ”
 
  “uhhhm no. She never does. Ya want some chips?”
 
  “
  I’m good, Ian.
  ” This hospitality was quite unexpected. 
 
  “I can’t have company over and 
  
    not
  
   give ‘em snacks!”
 
  It was diamond-clear to Luka that the thing that butchered Kaito and the thing in front of her right now trying to offer her Nacho Cheese Doritos were 
  
    not
  
   the same. He tore open a bag and started to chow down.
 
  “
  I think it’s time I cut to the chase here.”
 
  Ian managed to muffle a “Mmmph?”, as Luka said, 
  “Why do you trust Neru and her friends?
  ”
 
  “Teto says Eli and I ‘owe her one’.”, Ian said through a mouthful of cheese-covered tortilla chips.
 
  “
  You…  ‘owe her one?’
  ”
 
  “that, and Neru is kinda scary.”, he said.
 
  “
  How so?
  ”
 
  “If I don’t do what she says, I’m pretty sure I’m gonna get murdered. I won’t have to pay back my student loans, however, I wouldn’t be able to participate in Chuggaa Time
  ®
  . It’s like, the meanin’ of life.”
 
  It dawned on Luka that Ian didn’t have the full picture here.
 
  “
  And you think following 
  
    Teto
  
   is a good thing 
  
    because…
  
   ?
  ”, she asked
 
  “She says she has a way to get back at Michelle for what she did to me.”
 
  “
  What did Michelle do to you?
  ”
 
  Ian took a deep breath. Clearly, Luka had opened a can of worms.
 
  “One night, I was huggin’ the neso like the weeb filth that I am, and I said that I wanted Eli to be real, so that she could hug me back. Ya followin’ me? Hatsune Miku from Vocaloid 2.0 appeared, and did a sick frontflip onto that ledge over there and screeched 
  ‘UR HYGY’ 
  like the absolute gay robot she is, pointin’ at me with that dumb fucking cone-sleeve thingamabob’f hers. Then she did a sick backflip off the ledge and Narutoran away, off towards the maintenance complex. I think she was makin’ airplane noises with her mouth. But you wanna know the weirdest part? Ya wanna know the 
  
    weirdest part?! 
  
  She fucking 
  
    grew wings
  
  , four of ‘em, glowin’ in the dark, and then 
  
    fucken’ flew off
  
  ! They weren’t even moving! That’s gotta violate the laws of aviation, physics, or maybe both! 
 
  It must’ve been a dream because… that doesn’t happen in real life, but it just seemed all too real!” Ian did not realize the irony of this, and how he’d met at least seven anime characters in “real” life by now, or how he was mansplaining all of this to one of said characters. 
 
  “I didn’t know that was Michelle, too! Sure, 
  
    Michelle’s
  
   kinkshamed me, but that’s all been over text logs! Google Hangouts, Discord, and the like! DOIN’ IT IN PERSON LIKE THAT, and runnin’ away!? Pshaw! Some nerve she has!”
 
  “
  And now,” said Luka, “Teto says that you now ought to get revenge on Miku for that.
  ”
 
  “Of course!”
 
  “
  Do you 
  
    really
  
   have to get ‘revenge’, though? And if that’s the case, why are they making you 
  
    attack
  
   the others?
  ”

  
  
  

  Before Ian could mull it over, 
  
    someone
  
   had opened the door. And that 
  
    someone
  
   was Yowane Haku -- same silver crop-top, black sweatpants, indigo tie that was impractically short, bone-white ponytail that reached down past her waist, and the same moderately intoxicated mannerism as last week.
 
  “
  here’s ur fuckign waifu back, Ian…
  ” Haku tossed the neso to Ian. It bounced off of him, and made a squeaking sound as it hit the floor, not unlike a dog’s chew toy.

  The two Cryptloids gawked at each other for a second, before Luka dove out the window, racing across the Park lawn as fast as possible.
 
  “Well that’s rude.”, said Ian.
 
  Haku seemed worried.
 
  “
  How about we don’t tell Neru ‘bout this?”, she asked.
 
  “Why wouldn’t you tell her?”
 
  “
  She’d give me the chewing out of my FUCKING life since Number 3 got away… Ugh. After the thing with the monster girl, she 
  
    really
  
   hasn’t been too keen with me…
  ” Haku rolled her eyes, and finally noticed the second neso.  
  “So the deal is: 
  
    you
  
   don’t tell her or Teto, 
  
    I
  
   don’t tell her or Teto, and I take this thing with me,
  ” she said, picking up Nozomi.
 
  “Hol’ up, aren’t I gettin’ the short end here?”, asked Ian.
 
  “
  Well. you are. Sucks to be you, but if you were to show up with Missus Washi-Washi-Suru-Yan in tow, the other two wouldn’t be happy. And there’s no telling Teto won’t try and use her for one of her… projects.
  ”
 
  “... projects?”
 
  “
  Eyah.
  ” Haku plopped on the couch-bed beside Ian.
 
  “Wait,” asked Ian, “but you said ‘the other two’ wouldn’t be happy, but what about you?” Haku merely laughed.
 “Bahehahehahaheehaa…!! I haven’t been happy in thirteen years. Anyways, Neru wants you to come over tomorrow.” 
  “What for?”
 
  “
  Teto’s aforementioned ‘project’. The latest one. They 
  
    apparently
  
   need your help.
  ”
 
  “With what?”
 
  “
  I dun fuckin’ know! They never tell me anything ‘cause they think I’m useless!
  ”
 
  “Thursday’s always busy! I’ll do it Friday!”
 
  “
  Aight. Uh, bout Eli. She’ll turn herself back on in about an hour.
  ”
 
  Ian’s face said “What?!” enough, without him having to speak. Clearly, he was thinking about the other meaning of “turn on”. 
 
  “
  Yeah, uhhh, Teto apparently put an ‘off’ switch on her. It only lasts for maybe 8 hours, then she just… gets up, pushes the switch, aaaand turns back into a waifu… But the process is kinda freaky lookin’, if ya ask me.
  ”
 
  “Th-thanks for the advice.” 
 
  “
  You’re welcome!
  ”
 
  Haku made a peace sign as she walked out.
 
  “Cya Friday!~
  ”
 
  “See ya...”
 
  Ian stared at the nesoberi on the floor. Even if it didn’t have pupils, the nesoberi was staring back. With MALICE. Ian shut the window and got back to studying. Something big was going to happen Friday, but he had several exams coming up and wasn’t about to slack off. Truly, midterm exams were worse than any hostile anime character could be.
 
  F R I D A Y
 
  Ian was sitting at his desk, playing some dumb game on his laptop about monkeys and blimps. It was Friday. No homework, no classes, and hopefully no drama. 
  
    Hopefully.
  
   Eli was in the room as well, attempting to revert back into her less-than sentient state out of sheer spite alone. The off button was rather unfortunately placed on the acnetis, after all.
 
  Things were calm. It seemed as if it was going to be a good day today… and then Ian got a text from an unknown number. 
 
  “{
  hey im outside. we gotta go to nerus today, she seems enthusiastic about the thing she made.}
  ”
 
  “Oh, what the hell… ”
 
  “
  Is something up?
  ” Eli asked. To that, Ian gave off a heavy vibe of “unfortunately, yes”.

  “{And who is this?}“, texted Ian. 
 
  Haku texted back with a rather disinterested selfie.
 
  “{Ah.) {But WHERE are we going?}”
 
  “{
  neru’s house.} {i just said that u dip}
  ”
 
  “{Because she has something for me?}”
 
  “{

  “{nope} {Should Eli come with?}”
 
  “{

  “{Any specific reason as to why?}”
 
  “{

  ”
 
  “{?????}”
 
  “{
  You get used to it.}

  “Hey, Eli.”, Ian said, “It, ah, 
  
    seems I have to go…
  
  ”
 
  “
  It’s one of them, isn’t it.
  ”, said Eli dryly.
 
  “Yyyyeah. Neru has… uh…  ‘
  
    somethin’ to show me
  
  ’? Hoo boy.”
 
  “
  Oh, great! It’s the figurines of herself, isn’t it? Who even buys merchandise of 
  
    themselves
  
   to put on display like that?
  ”
 
  Ian seemed confused. 
 
  “
  
    Didn’t you…  or Kotori, or one of ‘m buy merch of yourselves, too?
  
  ”
 
  “
  That was Nico.
  ”
 
  “aight, aight. Im’ma head down.”

  As Ian went around the back of the dorm duplex, he noticed a very-out of place box with the Target logo. He didn’t think much of it. There were… other things to be worried about right now. Like Haku. Who was just standing there. (Not menacingly, however.)
 
  “So, uh, where’s this new portal at?”, asked Ian.
 
  “
  this way… I think
  ”, said Haku.
 
  “You don’t seem too confident in that.”
 
  Haku stopped for a moment and stared off into space.
 
  “
  I don’t remember the last time I was confident about 
  
    anything
  
  .
  ”
 
  “You, uh, 
  
    you okay there?
  
  ”
 
  “
  
    No.
  
   Regardless, 
  we’re almost at the place. Teto says this is supposed to be fool-proof, but I dunno… ”
 
  Haku pointed at the large satellite dish.
 
  “
  Not like it’s too hard to find that…
  ”
 
  Ian noticed that by The Hub’s loading dock, there was 
  
    another
  
   cardboard box with the Target logo on it. Or was it the same box? It seemed to be put there recently, too. A slit of indigo light had appeared on the nearest tree to the giant dish, and a solid rectangle of… 
  
    magic?
  
   had appeared. 
 
  “
  You comin’ in, tall boy?
  ”
 
  “What is THAT?”
 
  “
  The Gate.
  ”
 
  “To Neru’s House?”
 
  “
  To Neru’s House.
  ”
 
  “And I’m s’pposed to get through that?!”
 
  “
  The chainsaw got through pretty fine.
  ”
 
  “
  
    The chainsaw
  
  ?”
 
  “
  oops. No spoilers. Forget I said that.
  ” With that, Yowane Haku stepped through the gate. It was still open for some reason. Ian turned around one last time. The Target box had seemingly moved a couple feet to the left! 
 
  “You know what -- I’ve seen weirder. That’s probably considered ‘normal’ now… ”
 
  And with that, Ian stepped through the gate. It closed behind him. 

  
  

  Luka Megurine put in a new Module. This one was labelled “Racing.” The Gate opened up when she got near the tree without a hitch. 
 
  “
  So this is Neru’s hideout. I’ve come this far. Might as well go in… and have a look around!
  ”
 
  Luka knew full well that this was technically defying Miku’s orders. But she 
  
    might
  
   be able to put a stop to the Boukas, once and for all. 
 
  She took the box and went right through the Gate. 
 
  Ian found himself staring at some kind of bulky house, not unlike what would be seen in a snootier neighborhood down home. Haku was standing in the middle of what was possibly a driveway, but the feature seemed more like some kind of lawn made out of asphalt… There was yet another Target box here, too! 
 
  “
  Took you long enough.”, said Haku dismissively, “
  Come on in.” 
 
  And so Ian did.

  “
  OI, NERU!!”, yelled Haku before throwing off her tie, “WE’RE HOME!”
 
  Ian heard someone stomping down the stairs. He looked around. The decor here was high-end, although rather bland. He couldn’t shake these bad vibes off of him, however. 
 
  “
  
    Oh! Ian! We’re so glad you could come today!
  
  ”, said Neru in an uncharacteristically happy way. Seeing her smiling somehow was far, far more intimidating than her usual cranky demeanor.  
 
  “
  
    Uh-h
  
   I’m glad, too!”, Ian improvised
 
  Showing him around, Neru continued on: “
  
    Please, get yourself a drink, make yourself at home! We 
  
  never
  
     get company here!
  
  ”
  
     
  
 
  Ian opened up the fridge in the kitchen. There were no drinks inside. 
  
    She lied.
  
   There weren’t even shelves inside, for one irate Kasane Teto was seated in the fridge, eating out of a tub of margarine with a spoon. She seemed to be sitting on a pile of similar, albeit unopened, tubs.
 
  “
  
    SKYUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!
  
  ”, the UTAU screeched, slamming the door closed.
 
  “
  Not that fridge!
  
    ”
  
  , barked Neru.
 
  “Does Teto… always do that?”, asked Ian.
 “I’ve been trying to get her to stop for the past thirteen years now. You can obviously tell there’s been no luck on that. The refrigerator in the kitchen has been entirely claimed by her. ...which is why I’ll go get something from the basement!” 
  “you guys got coke zero?”
 
  “
  
    Is Pepsi Okay?
  
  ”
 
  “
  YYYES.
  ”, said Ian sternly.
 
  “
  
    Great! I’ll just be a couple minutes!~
  
  ” 
 
  “I can go down and get it.”
 
  “
  NO, NO!
  ” Neru cried, her new facade seemed to be weakening.
 “A-allow me to get your fuckign Pespis… You are company, after all… No need to exert yourself.” Ian noticed a Target box around in the foyer of the house.  
  “(Where are fuck these coming from? Do these people just really like Target?)”, Ian thought to himself. “So what does Neru want me to see so badly? Her anime figure collection?”
 
  “
  No Spoilers, Ian.
  ”, said Haku, conveniently nearby
 
  “What even is there to spoil? The chainsaw?”
 
  “
  
    Oh? Who said anything about a chainsaw?
  
  
    ”
  
  ,
 
  “You did, bitch!”

  Neru emerged from the basement.
 
  “
  Here’s ur fuckign pepsis, Ian
  ”, she said. Neru tossed the can to Ian. Bad idea, he was absolutely terrible at catching. The can plonked off of him, shaken all up, it sprayed zero-sugar cola all over  the couch and the laminate wood floor!
 
  “Uh, 
  
    oops
  
  ”, said Ian.
 
  “
  
    No, no! That’s fine.
  
  ”, said Neru saccharinely, before pulling a complete 180. 
  “Haku clean it up
  ” 
 
  DTM-3 looked like she didn’t care about anything. And to be fair, she didn’t. Not since 
  
    the incident
  
  .
 
  “
  Hwut
  ”, she said half-heartedly.
 
  “
  clean up. The fucking soda.
  ”
 
  “
  Aighhht
  ”
 
  “So what’s the deal?”asked Ian “You wanted to show me your anime figure collection?”
 
  Something within Neru snapped. “
  
    WHO. TOLD YOU. ABOUT THAT.
  
  ”, she said strained.
 
  “Eli.”
 
  The Pepsi can in Neru’s hand was crushed to bits, as more soda got onto the floor. 
 
  “
  OH. DID SHE?
  ”
 
  “Yep.” Ian could’ve sworn he saw the Target box shimmy away from the cola puddle, but he figured it was just his imagination. Neru took a deep sigh and regained her composure… (what composure she even 
  
    had
  
  )
 
  “
  Do you really wanna see it?
  ”
 
  “
  YES
  ”, said an overly enthusiastic Ian.
 
  She was slightly concerned about how over-eager Ian was. Slightly. 
 
  “
  Alright, it’s in my room…
  ” She took off up the stairs as Ian followed.
 
  “
  
    Behehehehe
  
  …”  
   
 
  “
  ...and here’s where I live.
  ”, Neru said, pushing open the door.
 
  “ah”
 
  So this was Neru’s room. It was certainly bigger than his dorm room, but not by a large margin. A desk sat to the left, with a somewhat dated looking desktop on top. Neru seemed to have something open on the computer, but the first thing she did was close out whatever that was. Some forum or the other…  On another desk with three drawers on it, on the opposite side of the room sat another desk. Papers were littered all over it. A neso of Miku was also there, apparently being used as some sort of pincushion or stress toy. It was clear that this thing had taken a beating, and the twintails seemed to have been cut off at some point. 
  
    Ian didn’t know why Neru owned merch of her sworn nemesis
  
  , 
  
    and quite frankly, didn’t want to know
  
  . Above that was a bulletin board, with a picture of … Michelle? And her friends. And Ian. And the Vocaloids, including a purple one Ian had never seen before. Michelle and her friends were all strung to whichever virtual pop star they were, but Ian’s picture was all alone at the top, save for the sticky note with the sole word “
  WHY
  ??”. The back of the room was mostly taken up by Neru’s bed (surprisingly kept neat) and a  large box with… trading cards? Of the Vocaloids? This didn’t make sense… 
 
  “
  You wanted to see the fucking figures, right?...
  ”, asked Neru. 
 
  “why am I on the bulletin board”
 
  “
  THE FIGURINES. LOOK AT THEM, YOU TWIT, SO WE CAN GET OUT OF HERE.
  ”
 
  
    Aaaaaaand
  
   the last thing in the room, above whatever vanity mirror thing girls used. The anime collection. Yes. It was anime. 
  
    Finally
  
  . Three whole shelves of it! Several figurines were of Neru and Haku, though. They were of questionable quality.  Although, a particularly detailed figurine of Neru was on the center of the top shelf. Its base was a bit too big for one character, almost like someone else was supposed to be with her. There were some official-looking figures too, but of other, Non-Cryptloidian characters. Ian didn’t recognize those… except nine of them, on the bottom… 
 
  “
  
    Ah-koo-wars!?!
  
  ”, shouted Ian.
 
  “
  What?
  ”
 
  “Ah-koo-wars!? The fuckin’, 
  
    uuuhhhh,
  
   Love Live 2?”
 
  “
  You mean… 
  
    Sunshine
  
  …? And 
  
    Aqours
  
  ?
  ”
 
  “Yeah, whatever. All my friends hate that show, but I like it.”
 
  “
  Oh, do they?
  ”
 
  “We got, 
  
    Baka Chika, Boat Cuck, Cynophobia, Munchy Baby Don’t Know How Techmology Work, Fallenkin, Ru-babby,  KONO DIA DA!-
  
  ” Neru gagged. “
  
    Nani!?
  
  ”, said Ian
 
  “
  N-nothing…
  ”
 
  “... 
  
    Jotaro’s Favorite-
  
  ” Again, Neru gagged, a bit louder this time.
 
  “You okay, Neru?”
 
  “
  I-i think we should just go on to the garage… 
  ”, she said hoarsely.
 
  “But hoosier fav’rit?!”, barked Ian. 
 
  “
  Riko.
  ”, said Neru.
 
  “Wrong! It’s Hanamaru.”, said Ian sternly.
 
  “
  What?
  ”
 
  A Target box resting by the top of the stairs was seemingly pushed by a ghost. It slid down the stairs and back into the living room.
 
  “WHAT. THE FUCK.” “NERU, DID YOU SEE THAT?”
 
  “
  See what?
  ”
  
    
    
  

  “THE SPOOKY BOX!”, shouted Ian.
 
  “
  That doesn’t make any sense. Boxes aren’t supposed to be spooky.
  ” The irony was seemingly lost on her. 
 
  “HAKU DID YOU SEE THE SPOOKY BOX?!”
 
  She was busy wiping up the soda with paper towels. Haku said nothing. Teto was still presumably in the fridge eating margarine. 
 
  “
  Just get to the garage.
  ”

  
  

  The garage. Oh, boy. This is going to be the big moment, isn't it? Tools were hung up on a big board on the wall, and a rather bulky, orange chainsaw laid upon a steel table, surrounded by mechanical parts.
 
  “
  So here’s what I wanted to show you.
  ”, said
 
  “A chainsaw?”
 
  “
  Wait, how’d you know? But this won’t be 
  
    any
  
   chainsaw… Kehehe…!
  ”
 
  Neru opened a drawer in the bench. Meiko’s and Kaito’s Cores were inside!
 
  “
  We can use these bad boys to soup it up, and then… And then…
  ”
 
  “Neru?”
 
  “
  I can finally tear Ol’ Listerine’s twintails right out of her damn head!! 
  She’ll be decommissioned, and then 
  
    I 
  
  can be number one! Everyone will love 
  
    me
  
  ! Just like you said, Ian, we’ll-
  ”
 “Neru, stop evilly monologuin’!”, yelled Ian, “There’s another goddamn Target box! What in  the goddamned hell even is the deal with these?”  
  Walking over to the other side of the garage, Ian seemed determined to find out the mystery. 
 
  “
  Ian, I’ve got a bad feeling about that box.
  ”, said Neru. 
 
  “Oh, do ya? What? If I open it, is 
  
    Miku
  
   gonna jump out and kinkshame me? Is she gonna kinkshame YOU, too?”
 
  Ian tore open the cardboard box. It wasn’t Miku. Nope.
 
  Megurine Luka was staring back at him, seemingly just as embarrassed as he was. Her outfit was different. Ian had no idea why she’d be wearing 
  
    this
  
  . Logos for companies covered her sleeves, top, and stockings, he could practically see her 
  
    entire
  
   bare …pelvic area save for a few covered up parts. Ian tried not to stare at her thighs, but failed.
 
   Yet the most noteworthy thing about Luka’s new costume was that she had 
  
    butterfly wings, 
  
  composed out of some substance that reminded Ian of stained glass. There was some sort of circular pattern on each of the top ones, too. 
 
  “Uhh, hi.”, said Ian nonchalantly, “Might I ask what you’re doin’ here?”
 
  Luka shot out of the box. Neru was completely aghast. Luka checked something on her sleeve’s HUD.
 “As the offering has clearly failed, it now looks like I’m now here to murder you! I would say ‘nothing personal’, but unfortunately for you, it entirely is.” 
  Neru had bolted out of the room.
 
  “Coward!”, yelled Ian.
 
  Some kind of spear formed near her arm, much like how Meiko and Kaito had summoned various weapons. Gracefully drawing the spear out, Luka bawled out a war cry: 
 
  “
  This is for Kaito, you fat 
  
    fuck!
  
  ”
 
  [Recommended Listening:

  ]
 
  Slamming her spear into the ground, a pink energy filled the garage. It rose up the walls and blocked the door back into the house. 
 
  “
  There. Now 
  
    she
  
   won’t be coming back and I can worry about 
  
    you…
  
   and getting the cores back.
  ”
 
  Ian looked around for something, 
  
    anything
  
   he could use. The chainsaw! Ian wanted to run towards it, but he didn’t budge. Pinkish energy had surrounded his legs,He was caught in Luka’s attack!
 
  “‘EY! That’s cheatin’! Yeh can’t go twice! I get a turn!”
 
  “
  That would be if this was a 
  
    battle
  
  .”, groaned Luka, “I’m trying to 
  
    murder
  
   you. There’s a big difference, you uncultured swine!
  ”
 
  “Well then.” ,said Ian, who seemed to be very confident about something. “
  How ‘bout battle 
  
    YOU instead!
  
  ”
 
  “
  
    NOOOOOOOOO!!
  
  ”
 
  The familiar orange panel appeared in front of Ian. Something on Luka’s arm flickered. 
 
  Neru threw open the garage door. Teto was with her, but Haku was still presumably cleaning up (Or drinking. Maybe both!). The two couldn’t get through the force field, try as they might. Neru barked something at Teto, and the latter activated her drills and rammed into the field. Ian couldn’t tell if the sparks flying were coming from Teto or the force field, but either way, he couldn’t tell what they were doing. No numbers were appearing yet. 
 
  “
  STOP STARING AND DO SOMETHING!
  ”, yelled Luka. “NO!”, barked Ian.
 
  “
  Well then it’s not a battle anymore!” “
  OKAY FINE, JEEZ”
 
  Ian yanked the chainsaw off the table and revved it up. 
 
  “
  
    Here goes nothing!
  
  ”
 
  “
  
    Ah, ah ah~! Not your turn!
  
  ”
 
  “
  FUCKINHG HELL I DIDN’T EVEN DO ANYTHING.
  ”
 
  “
  That’s not true! You equipped a weapon. That used your turn.
  ”
 
  “
  SINCE WHEN WAS THAT HOW RPG COMBAT WORKED?!”
 
  “
  BITCH, I DON’T KNOW!
  ”
 
  “
  LOOKIN’ T’ME LIKE 
  
    YOU’RE
  
   THE BITCH ‘ROUND THESE PARTS!”
 
  “
  SHUT UP! SHUT UP! 
  
    SHUT! UP!
  
  ”
 
  Luka started spinning, and Ian swore she was floating off of the ground. Clearly, the wings weren’t just for show.
 
  “
  DOUBLE LARIAT!
  ”, cried Luka! Luka charged forward, spinning around with her spear like a buzzsaw. Ian knew what to do, and rammed the chainsaw into the circular pattern of the left wing!
 
  2,031!
 
  “
  YIIIIAHHHHHHHHH!
  ”
 
  The left wing shattered! Luka fell down, and the force field seemed to weaken.
 
  “
  
    You’ll pay for that, cishet!
  
  ”
 
  Ian was beside himself, as Teto kept her assault on the force field! 
 
  “What?”said Ian, “Am I not allowed to counter attack? Now then, 
  
    pinko,
  
   it’s 
  
    my
  
   go around!”
 
  Ian charged with the chainsaw in hand, screaming like he had nothing to lose.
 
  “YIIIIIIH!” Luka floated up and out of the way of Ian’s sawing. 
 
  Miss!
 
  “WHAT!?”
 
  “
  
    And I’m not allowed to dodge?
  
  ”, japed Luka, in a mockery of Ian.
 
  She lowered herself. 
 
  “
  NOW! Double Lariat, REVERSE!
  ” Luka was spinning counter-clockwise now. How original. Ian jammed the chainsaw into the right wing. It shattered!
 
  2,029!
 
  “
  
    RIYAHHHHHH!!!
  
  ”, cried Luka. She collapsed, and her barrier shattered. Teto fell over from the sudden lack of resistance. 
 
  “
  Pyeh.
  ”, muttered the UTAU.
 
  “
  Well then.”, said Luka, “I  really didn’t think it would come to this, Ian. But sometimes, you just can’t have nice things… 
 
  DOUBLE LARIAT 
  
    SQUARED!
  
  ”
 
  Luka rose up into the air once more. Another spinning attack? Not quite! Energy drew in around her, tools flew off the shelf and the board. Boxes containing god-knows-what were pulled in, and the chainsaw was ripped right out of Ian’s hands! Luka had created some kind of psychic maelstrom!
 
   
  Teto charged into the garage, raring to do some sort of drill attack! But she couldn't, for Kasane Teto was dragged into the maelstrom! 
 
  “
  Kreeeeyaahhh!”
 
  Teto made a strange growling noise as tools pelted her as she was dragged around!
 
  40! 43! 42! 45! 42! 41!
 
  Ian thought about what to do.
 
  “Neru! Ya gotta gimme your sword!”
 
  “
  Why?!
  ”, cried Neru.
 
  “I know what to do!”
 
  “
  And what is that?
  ”
 
  “
  
    Jus’ roll with me, Isaw this in an episode of 
  
  Stardust Crusaders
  
     once!
  
  ”
 
  Neru’s eye twitched. She summoned her two-handed sword and kicked it over to Ian. However, she then immediately bent over and threw up. Luka stopped her onslaught briefly.
 
  “
  Oh, that’s disgusting.
  ”, she said.
 
  This was just enough time for Ian to attack! He swung the sword around, spiraling inwards, rocketing towards Luka. She tried to resume her attack, but it was too late!
 
  “
  
    ORA!!
  
  ”, Ian cried out, as the sword plowed into the back of her head!
 
  1,690!
 
  “Nice!”, cried Ian, “69!”
 
  Luka was downed!  “
  My turn, bitch!
  ”, snarled Teto. She picked herself up out of the pile of tools. She hopped on top of Luka and pulled out the lance.
 
  “
  
    There can only be one Pepto-Bismol in this hell fiction!
  
  ”
 
  “
  Y-you’re the Pepto-Bismol.
  ”, muttered Luka.
 
  Teto rammed the lance into Luka’s back. Both of them were screaming as crystalline pink liquid -- like whatever came out of Kaito, but 
  
    pink
  
   this time, sprayed out as Teto’s lance drilled deeper. 
 
  535! 532! 880!-Crit! 532! 533! 534!
 
  Eventually, Luka stopped screaming. Teto pulled out something.
 
  A pink, marquise-cut gem. The core of Megurine Luka. 
  As per the last two times, a strange whirring sound filled the garage. The various items strewn about sorted themselves back out as if by magic. (and it was) The pink “blood” remained on the floor, however, as Luka’s hair turned brown.

  “So that does it, that’s three now… What're we gonna do with her?”
 
  “
  Good Question.”, said Neru. “Teto, 
  
    you know how to hide a body, right?
  
  ”
 
  “
  Yeop!
  ”, beamed the UTAU. Clearly, this was not her first time around the block.
 
  “
  Come again?!
  ”, cried Ian.
 
  “
  That’s where 
  
    you
  
   fucked up, Ian.”, said Neru, “Ya left Kaito out, and he got away. 
  
    Pinky 
  
  here won’t be so lucky.
  ” 
 
  Teto had already grabbed a cartoonishly evil looking sack -- big enough to stuff a deactivated robotic idol into… She shoved Luka in there.
 
  “
  Oi! Tell Haku I’m borrowing her car for a while!
  ”, said Teto.
   
 
  “How are we gonna use the car 
  
    in here
  
  ?”, asked Ian.
 
  “.
  .. I drive to the Potomac River and throw her off the bridge??
  ”
   
 
  “The Potomac!? Aren’t we in some kind of pocket dimension?”
 
  “
  N-… No. This is Loudoun.
  ”
 
  “Oh.”
 
  “
  Did you actually think we lived in a pocket dimension?”, asked Neru.
 
  “yes” , said Ian.
 
  “
  Well. We don’t.”
 
  “
  Okay.”
 
  Teto put the gem with the other two in the drawer and grabbed some keys off the steel table. She stuffed Luka into the Civic’s trunk and got in the car.
 
  “
  cya, losers
  ”, said Teto, peeling out. Ian turned to Neru.
 
  “So, what now? We’ve got three cores…”
 
  “
  This… changes things. 
  
    For the better.
  
   Grah hah hah hah HAH!
  ”, cackled Neru.
 
  “Can I go home yet?”, asked Ian naively, “I have a paper due Wednesday.” 
 
  “
  Teto can just get one of her girls to do it for ya… 
  ”
 
  “Doesn’t that violate the Honor Code of George Mason University, and thus, compromise my academic integrity!?”
 
  “
  SHUT UP, NERD, AND LET ME MONOLOGUE!
  ”
 
  Neru was finally back to her old self again! How wonderful!
 
  “O-oh-kay…”

  Ian unlocked the dorm door and went back into the room. Eli was still reading the same book from earlier, although she seemed to be mostly through it by now. 
 
  “
  
    So how was Neru’s?
  
  ”, asked Eli.
 
  “Uhh, was.”, said Ian.
 
  “
  What’s that supposed to mean?
  ”
 
  “They clearly aren’t okay. Neru had this terrible fake act half the time, and her room just didn’t feel… right. Her whole house didn’t feel right!”
 
  “
  Her room? You saw those damn figurines, too, didn’t you?
  ”
 “Uhh, yeah. Somethin’ was off about the one on the top shelf. Ya know whaddai mean, right, where it looked like there used to be another character there? Why’d Neru have one that’s broken like that? It ain’t right. That, and the toy. Looked like it was one of Miku, er, emphasis on that ‘was’.” 
  “
  They’re weird.

  “Oh, and I also ran into Luka.”
 
  “
  LUKA?!
  ”
 
  “Hey, I won, 
  
    and
  
   I didn’t black out this time! That’s a first! But technically, Teto’s the one that gut Luka, but hey, that’s one less gay robot we have to worry about before we can get on with ourselves!”
 
  “
  Ian, do you even know what you’re saying?!
  ”
 
  “No, I Do Not.”, Ian said with confidence, “All I just want to get back to my 
  
    normal
  
   life, but it seems we have to play along with 
  
    their 
  
  little gang war for the foreseeable future. Trust me, 
  
    I
  
   don’t want to be doing this!” Eli threw the book down.
 
  “
  
    I
  
   don’t want to do this either! But Teto’s forcing m- 
  
    us
  
   too! … A-and you know what,” Eli shot up. “There’s something I have to tell you!
  ” 
 
  “And what is that?”
 
  “
  I-i-i’m…
  ” There was a sharp “plunk!” at the window. Kasane Teto was outside! Nevermind how she was standing outside of a
  
     second
  
   floor window, how’d she get here so quickly?
 
  Muffled by the glass, Teto spoke:
 
  “
  Go on then, Eli. What
  
     is it
  
   you want to tell Ian so badly?
  ”
 
  “Teto what the fuck are you doing.”, said Ian. Her hands folded together as she feigned innocence. Her face, however, was pressed against the glass.
 
  “
  Oh, just stopping by to see some of my bestest friends~ ♡
  ”
 
  “You saw me two hours ago.”, said Ian flatly.
 “Enough of that. Go on, Eli-Chi~! Tell Ian your heart’s desire… !”  Teto sneered, seemingly waiting for something extraordinarily eagerly. 
  “
  Ian, I…
  ” Eli said, searching deep within herself.
 
  “
  I…
  ”
 
  “
  Ooh Hooo Hooo Hooo!
  ”, chortled the UTAU
 
  “Come on, then!”, spat Ian. Eli looked distant.
 
  “
  
    Want to go to Chipotle!
  
  ”, cried Eli. Tears ran down her cheeks, whereas Teto seemed unhappy with something. 
 
  “Why’re you cryin’, then?!”, shouted Ian.
 
  “
  
    The burritos… are too good…
  
  ”
 
  “What did Haku do to you…?” 
 
  It seemed that Eli was lying to him about something.
 
  “Aight.”, said Ian. “Let’s all go to Chipotle, there’s one in Johnson. Bring the other two along! But 
  
    first
  
  , we GOTTA have CHUGGAA TIME
  ®
  !! Care to join us, Teto?”
 
  “
  No.

  “U sure?”
 
  “
  ...yes.
  ”
 
  “Bah, suit yourself.”
 
  “
  I’ll go see if the others are down for Mexican.
  ”
 
  THE LORD appeared on Ian’s laptop. 
 
  “
  HEY EVERYBODY! IT’S CHUGGAACONROY!! LAST TIME, …
  ” Eli. for once, actually wanted to watch the Ell Pee with Ian. Admittedly, it was just to serve as a distraction from Teto.  

  About an hour or so after that all went down

  “So everybody’s got their stuff now? Are we good here?”
 
  “
  
    Yuh
  
  ”, said Haku.
 
  “
  Yeah.
  ”, said Teto.
 
  “
  y-yep…
  ”, said Eli. 
 
  “Great! Why don’t we sit outside?”, asked Ian.
 
  “
  This isn’t even bread.”, said Teto, tearing the tortilla off of her burrito. “I’ve been lied to.
  ” 
 
  Neru said nothing.
 
  “
  Can you even call this thing a sandwich?
  ”, asked Teto.
 
  “No. No you don’t.”, said Ian. “No one 
  
    on Earth
  
   calls a burrito a sandwich.” Meanwhile, Eli was staring off into space again.
 
  “
  
    Yu-ri Gaga-rin!
  
  ”, jeered Teto.
 
  “You, okay Eli?”, asked Ian. “You seem kinda out of it… ”
 
  “
  I-i’m fine.
  ”, she responded. Clearly, Eli was 
  
    not
  
   fine, considering she seemed so distracted today.
 
  “No, you ain’t. If you were fine, ya wouldn’t have to say you were ‘fine’!”
 
  “
  Uh huh.
  ” 
 
  “So, er 
  
    changing the subject
  
  …
 
  Ey, Neru. I noticed one of the figures in your room had, like,this really big base for some reason… like something was supposed to go there. What happened to it, did it break off or something? Was it just built like that?”
 
  Neru said nothing. Again. How rude.
 
  “Neru?”
 
  She was staring at the ground, silent.
 
  “
  
    Neru?
  
  ”
 
  “
  ... someone used to be there.
  ”, said Neru morosely.
 
  A single tear rolled off her cheek. 
 
  “N-neru?? You OK?” 
 
  Teto was staring at the ground, too, seeming awfully woeful about something. Did one of the Boukas die? That could have been the case, as it’d explain why there weren’t any “derivatives” of Rin, Len, or the others… Eli finally decided to get into her dinner. 
 
  “
  She doesn’t like to talk about it, Ian.
  ”, said Haku rather sternly
 
  “Noted.”, said Ian. “I-a, uh, I’m sorry. I’m sorry for your loss, Neru.” 
 
  Neru had burst into a full-on sob.
 
  “
  
    N-n-ever… again…
  
  ”
 
  Ian sat in silence with the other three as Neru continued to cry. He wished he could do something to help.

  “
  You’re lucky you didn’t end up like Gumi!
  ”, said Meiko.
 
  “
  Meiko…
  ”, said Michelle pensively.
 
  “
  No, no, those are the kind of fuckers we’re dealing with! Those backstabbing MURDERERS were just itching to get another victim under their belt!!

  “
  She’s lucky she isn’t going to end up like Fukase today!

  Like Fukase?

  It then occurred to the group that Miku was, legally, their boss, but hadn’t had to do any boss-like things for literal years. 
 
  “
  Why’d we even fire him again?
  ”, asked Len.
 
  “
  WE KNOW DAMN WELL WHAT FUKASE DID, AND HE DESERVES HIS FATE.

  Still think that was kinda overkill tbh

  “
  So in OTHER NEWS, I’ve finally translated Eli’s letter…

  Can YOU read Russian?

  “
  No.

 “ Michelle… Miku, whoever you are, My name is Ayase Eli. I was the ninth member in an idol group called μ’s many years ago. But that isn’t important now. Legally, I don’t exist. I don’t know how it happened or why it happened, but due to dark sorcery on the part of one Kasane Teto, I seem to have popped into existence. It’s strange. I remember everything from my childhood, and my days with μ’s, but nothing after that. It’s silence until about six months ago… when he bought me. Ian. Goodness. There are people I’d much rather be spending my time with than him, but it seems that he likes the company, even after the three of them showed up. You’re probably familiar with those three names: Akita Neru, Yowane Haku, Kasane Teto. None of them are good news, but it’s Neru that I’m the most worried about. Ian’s been going off to work on some ‘special project’ of theirs lately. Haku let it slip one time that they’re going to use the ‘cores’ with it. What exactly it is, I am unsure.  
  Neru isn’t the only thing that threatens me. No, how do I put this? Teto, seems to have me under some sort of contract? I’m supposed to be Ian’s ‘girlfriend’ and lead him on to the three of them, but she 
  
    knows
  
   I’m lesbian… and Ian doesn’t. There’s no way I’ve managed to find to tell Ian that I’m not and won’t be interested in him, as Teto 
  
    conveniently
  
   appears every time I try to do so and demands our attention. Haku isn’t that much of a threat, I am sure of that. Not like she can even set down the damn bottle for fifteen minutes! And yet, I don’t even think 
  
    I’m
  
   the one in the most danger here. 
 
  Ian is not okay, mentally. I know, big surprise, but I’ve been forced into the same room as him for half a year now. I think it’s fair to say that I know what he’s like. A couple weeks back, however, when Kaito attacked. Ian didn’t seem like himself. Normally, this would be a good thing, but Ian’s gotten 
  worse
  . He went absolutely berserk! Then it came again the next day, when he was in the middle of talking to Neru. Complete personality shift, it was like he was a different person! And maybe he is… I think all of this Cryptloidian flim-flam has made Ian gone off of the deep end.. He’d developed a split personality -- I’ll call it ‘
  Ian’s Nefarious Alternative
  ’ or ‘
  INA’.
   It’s surreal, seeing this oversized fool go from mucking about suddenly plot with Neru about how he’s going to murder his best friend!
 
  What the 
  
    hell
  
   am I supposed to do!? I don’t think there’s any good way for you to contact me other than this -- letter writing. I get it. ‘OK Boomer’. Yes. Get it out of your system, but this lavender-haired one, Uta. She knows when Ian (INA included here) or I use any sort of electronic device, so all of 
  that
   is out the window. I just hope that this information can get to you before you send off Luka -- if something bad happens to her, I believe that Ian will pass a tipping point that I think he can’t come back from.

  Kaito posted a gif of John Mulaney.
 
  “
  
    Now we don’t have time to unpack all of that!!
  
  ”
 
  “
  Yes we do.
  ”, said Len matter-of-factly.
 
  “
  You only have all that free time because you aren’t in IB!
  ”, said Kaito.
 
  “
  Len you have done your one (1) helpful and relevant thing for the day, you know the drill, you now have to fuck off
  ”, said Michelle.
 
  “
  DO I…?
  ”, said Len exasperatedly.
 
  “
  Go to bed or you’re fired!
  ” It was barely past 4:45 in the afternoon, but Len wasn’t one to disobey the boss. Len signed off.
 
  “
  So we have a name now for that thing…
  ”, said Luka.
 
  “
  Ina.  That has got to be THE STUPIDEST name I have ever heard.
  ”
 
  “
  But it is 
  
    a
  
   name.
  ”, said Kaito.
 
  “
  That’s true
  ” 
 
  “
  you think…”, asked Rin, “we should do somethin?
  ” 
 
  “
  What do you mean ‘we’?
  ”, said Michelle.
 
  “
  Len and I.
  ”
 
  “
  RIN NO FGHJFGHJFGHJ We can’t lose you!
  ”
 
  “
  what makes you think we’ll lose? there ARE two of us…
  ”
 
  “
  Like that’s going to stop Ian? Who’s to say the Magic Chainsaw hasn’t been finished yet? That, and the Boukas are probably going to be on High Alert now that 
  
    ONE OF US WENT INTO THEIR HOUSE
  
  ”,
 
  “
  It was ONE time!
  ”, said Luka.
 
  “
  ONE TIME TOO MANY
  … 
  Rin, please. We can’t afford to lose another, especially TWO OTHERS!!
  ”
 
  “
  So we’re just gonna let Ian keep on doin’ what he’s doin’?!
  ”, said Rin.
 
  “
  ... I’m afraid we don’t have much of a choice.
  ”
 
  “
  What do you mean, we don’t have a choice?!
  ”
 
  “If you and Len were to go after Ian now, then INA would come out and make lemon bars out of the two of you! If *I* were to go after Ian… Well, I can’t, I’m running behind on the German Honors Project… 
  ”
 
  “
  And why is the German Project stopping you dead in your tracks?”, asked Kaito, “Your grade can take it, right?
  ”
 
  “
  no it fuckghing can’t nerd, and also There Are Worse Things In This World than Teto, Neru, or this… INA could ever be… and some of them teach German. If you all will excuse me, it’s almost Chuggaa Time®…
  ”
 
  And with that, Miku promptly closed the Hangouts app. 
 
  “
  Nerd.
  ”, said Rin.
 
  “
  Rin!”, shouted Kaito, “Watch what you’re saying!
  ”
 
  “
  no. miku is a nerd. we gotta nip this INA fucker in the bud before he kills us all!
  ”
 
  “
  And you do you suppose you’d do that!?”, asked Luka, “You saw what IAN did to me…
  ”
 
  “
  there’s three of us and one of Ian.
  ”
 
  “
  And there’s Two of Boukas, One of Teto, and One of Eli.”, said Meiko, “That’s FIVE.
  ”
 
  “
  yes, i know how to count.
  ”
 
  “
  YOU’LL. GET. CORED.
  ”, seethed Kaito.
 
  “
  not my problem.
  ”
 
  “
  You’re right, Rin.
  ”, said Luka, “
  It’s all of our problems.
  ”

  
  

  Michelle’s phone was still going with the familiar “pling” of Google Hangouts. 
 
  “
  please don’t be Ian, please don’t be Ian…
  ” Thankfully, it was not Ian. Rin, or as they were more commonly known as, 
  
    Rio
  
  , was still going on about something. The message was too long to tell in the notification. It seems that Rio was willing to die on their hill, by the looks of it.
 
  “
  Not my problem”, boasted Michelle, “OUR LORD is about to return!!
  ”
 
  THE LORD appeared on the desktop. Michelle squeed and set the phone to Do Not Disturb.
 
  “
  HEY EVERYBODY! It’s Chuggaaconroy, Last Time, we took to the skies with Robobot Jet and faced off against COGS!! This time, we’re gonna…
  ”
 
  “
  haha YES

  Michelle got another notification. Her phone was still on DND, so it didn’t make a sound. Not as if she would willingly tear herself away from Chuggaa Time
  ®
  … However, like all good things must, Chuggaa Time
  ®
    came to an end. Michelle checked her phone, and to her surprise, a message from Ian, of all people:
 
  “{Hey, Michelle! I’m gonna be back in town from Gorg Mason next week! Would you wanna hang out, provided IB stuff hasn’t got you down? (flushed emoji) [sic]}” 
 
  “
  Heh… Heh… ‘IB Stuff…’ Like he isn’t playing dumb… You know what, Ian? FUCK IT! COME DIRECTLY INTO MY GODDAMN HOUSE! Why don’t you… 
  
    HAVE SOME FUN WITH MIKU!!

  “{That’d be lovely!! :)}”
 
  
    “GYUH HYAH HYAH HYAH HYAH-

  “Michelle!”, shouted Steve, “What’re you evilly laughing for?” Yes,

  “SHIT! SHIT!

  “
  So what is it now?”, asked Eli, “Does Neru want you to come over again?
  ”
  
    
    
  

  “NONONONONONONONO, 
  WORSE

  “
  What?! How could it be worse than 
  
    half-tail?

  “ t w i n t a i l… ”, said Ian strainedly.

  “MIKU-CHELLE!! MAGDALEN!! COOL!! IT!!!”
 
  “

  “I DON’T KNOW WHAT I’M DOING!!”

  
    
  
  “

  “PROBABLY NOT, WE’LL DRAW A NOISE COMPLAINT!!”
 
  “
  THEN WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING?!?

  “
  
    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
  
 
  …I can make this work.

  “
  How!? HOW!? How are you going to ‘make this work’? You effectively killed and dismembered two of her friends!

  “Just don’t bring it up! Don’t bring up Meiko, Kylo Ren, 
  
    or 
  
  Luca.”
 
  “
  T

  “Probably.”
 
  “
  ARE YOU 
  
    INSANE
  
  !?
  ”
 
  “Yes! I’m glad you noticed.”
 
  Eli sighed deeply.  “
  Fine then. Just text her back already! Don’t make it worse than it has to be… 
  ”
 
  “Aiiight.”

  
  

  “{So would Saturday, the Fourteenth, work best for you?}”
 
  “{
  Lemme ask my parents}”
 
  “{Yeah}
  ”
 
  “{UH OH. 👀👀👀😲😲 😵😵🤪🤪 DID MEECHELLE 🤓🤓🍬🍬🤖🤖👩‍🎤👩‍🎤 JUST SAY ‘YEAH’ 😳😳😳😳😳😳 ?????}”
 
  “{😩 
  Why are you like this, Ian?}
  ” 
   
 
  “
  Well then,”, said Eli, “I suppose we have bigger things to worry about now…
  ”
 
  “What?”, asked Ian, “What could that even be?”
 
  “
  Spring. Break. 
  
    You’re going to be home
  
  . Your mother already knows about the ‘damned doll’... 
  
    which would be me.
  
   Since you took me to more places than anyone with a social life logically should have, if your mother noticed you returning home without the doll, it would seem suspicious, would it not?. What are you going to do? Do you even have a cover story planned?
  ”
 
  “Why would we need that, lmao” Yes, Ian just said “lmao”, out loud unironically.
 “Do you honestly think your mother is going to buy that you got a girlfriend, ditched the neso, and that your three new ‘friends’ have your best interests in mind? Have you even told her about ANY of this?” 
  “Oh, shit…”
 
  “
  ‘Oh shit’ is right!
  ”
 
  “
  
    So you’re not my girlfriend?
  
  ”, squeaked Ian. Once again, Ian had had all of his priorities in all of the wrong places… 
 
  “
  
    No.
  
  ” She couldn’t be like that. She was a cryomancer, but she wasn’t 
  
    that
  
   kind of ice-cold… She wasn’t Lanzhu! Might as well get to the point now. 
 “Because… I’m just not… interested… in…” 
  “Not interested in… me? Am I too fat, is it that?”
 
  “
  
    Who said you were fat?
  
  ”
 
  “Teto.”, said Ian matter-of-factly.
 
  And as if being called in, Kasane Teto threw open Ian’s door. 
 
  “What’s tha matter with you!?”, Ian spat.
 
  “
  Go on, then, Gagarin!”, sneered Teto, “Why don’cha tell ‘im what's wrong?

  Eli shrieked! “
  I-

  The lance pierced right through Eli’s back, and stuffing burst out with the lance’s tip. She collapsed and reverted back into the neso.
 
  667! 663! 667! 665! 668! 666!
 
  “
  That’s a breach of contract, 
  
    tankie

  “Teto, I’d like to ask what the fuck you’re doing.”, said Ian, as he stood up.
 
  “And I’d like to not answer! Seeya ‘round!
  ” She grabbed Eli and hurried off!
  
    
    
  

  “What the fuck. WHAT THE FUCK!?” Ian could’ve sworn he Teto was flipping him off from outside. 
 
  “What, 
  
    IN GOD’S NAME

  Once again, 
  
    with no respect for Ian’s privacy
  
  , Kasane Teto burst down the door. Or at least, she would have if the door had been repaired, instead of dangling off of its hinges.
 
  Clearly, Ian was going to get a 
  
    nasty
  
   bill from the housing department.
  
    
    
  

  “
  Anyways, Here’s Eli!
  ”,said Teto, chucking the neso at Ian. It bounced off of his head and landed squarely on the floor.
 
  “
  If anybody needs me, I’m off to go commit Felony Motor Vehicle Theft!
  ”
 
  “I didn’t ask?”, said Ian.
 
  At the very least, he had Eli back. Ian still couldn’t get used to the sight of Eli “picking herself up”; he swore something about her was off, though.
 
  “
  Ugh… What’re you looking at, Ian?
  ”, asked Eli.
 
  “Oh, hey, I found this on eBay! AND it’ll get here in time!”
 
  “
  And it’s …me?
  ”
 
  “Problem solved!”
 
  “No, it’s the wrong model. That’s just the school uniform.

  “Like mom’d be able to tell the difference?”
 
  “
  Sure, but Michelle would.

  “FUCK. Like she’d remember anything that’s not Xenoblade Chronicles lore?”
 
  “
  Alright, that’s valid, but that doesn’t get rid of 
  
    Teto

  “
  NEW PLAN

  “
  Where are you going to get all that cola?

    -Ian
  
 
  It seemed like today was going to be alright, given two things: whatever “novel coronavirus” was going down in China 
  
    stayed
  
   in China, and Ian was kidding about coming over. Unfortunately, neither of those things were going to happen.

  Michelle noticed something outside of the home office’s window.  A silver compact sedan had pulled up, looked like it was a Honda. Michelle could have sworn she had seen it somewhere before. A blonde woman was driving. Michelle couldn’t quite make out who it was, but it was clear that she did have a ponytail. In the passenger seat next to her was… WAS… 
 
  “
  
    oh no
  
  …
  ”, muttered Michelle. She should have known. 
 
  “
  don’t tell me Ian 
  
    actually showed up!
  
  ”, said Rio. They were over today for… totally unrelated reasons. 
 
  “
  He actually did it. And it seems he’s not alone today, either heh heh…
  ” The blonde woman closed the car door. Ian was reaching into the back seat for something… a backpack?
 
  “
  then that would be…
  ” 
 
  “
  That would be 
  
    the bitch
  
  , Rin.
  ”
 
  “
  but why bring 
  
    her
  
  ?
  ”
 
  There was a heavy knock at Michelle’s door.
 
  “
  
    Michelle,
  
  ”, said Steve squarely, “
  
    Can you get that? I’m busy.
  
  ”
 
  Steve was sitting on a chunk of wooden stairs, flicking a lever back and forth on his “desk”, not much more than two slabs and some bookshelves.
 
  “
  What are you busy with, anyways?
  ”, asked Michelle. 
 
  To this, Steve stopped flicking the lever. He turned to Michelle with the same, deadpan smile he seemingly always had.
 
  “Adult business work”, said Steve, again, squarely. Because he is square. “Now please, answer the door. Isn’t your friend, Ian, supposed to be coming over today?”
   
 
  “
  Yeah,
  ” said Michelle. Big mistake.

  A muffled “
  UH OH
  ” could be heard from outside. Thus, Ian had verified his identity.
 “Some ‘Friend’... Let’s just get this crap over with…” Michelle opened the front door. 
  “hey nerd”, said Ian. Michelle slammed the door on him.
 
  “Why are you like this”, he asked.
 
  “
  Why are 
  
    you
  
   like this?
  ”, asked Michelle.
 
  “Why are you like this!?”, yelled Ian. Michelle opened the door back up.
 
  “
  WHY ARE 
  
    YOU
  
   LIKE THIS!?
  ”, screamed Michelle.
 
  “Why is Rio here?”, asked Ian. Rio had stepped out from Michelle’s living room.
 
  “
  Ian.”, they said, “I think we should be concerned about what 
  
    she’s doing here…
  
  ”, For that last part, they pointed at 
  
    the bitch
  
  .
 
  
    “
  
  Wow, Rio said a capital letter! Good for them. Good for them...”
 
  “
  Stop dodging the question, Ian.
  ”, said Michelle. 
  
    The bitch
  
   got nervous.
 
  “Oh. This is my new GF.”, said Ian, as if he was terribly attempting to cover something up, and failing miserably at it.
 
  “
  
    Ah, and just what would her name be?
  
  ”, asked Rio, with a tiny tint of rage in their voice. Throughout this exchange, Steve continued with his flicking of the lever. Adult business was 
  
    very
  
   important, after all. At the very least, the lack of total silence made the scene a bit less awkward. 
  
    The Bitch
  
   finally piped up.
 
  “
  Eli…zabeth.
  ”, said Elizabeth, who was totally 
  
    not 
  
  Ayase Eli from Love Live!: School Idol Project, and any resemblance thereof was completely coincidental.
 
  “
  Okay, 
  
    Elizabeth
  
  ,”, said Michelle snarkily, “I don’t remember inviting 
  
    you
  
   today! 
  
    OR EVER!!
  
  ”
 
  “Pretty sure I mentioned her in the text, Michelle.”, replied Ian.
 
  “
  AND I’M PRETTY SURE YOU DIDN’T! PEH!!
  ” Once again, Michelle slammed the door on Ian. 
 
  “
  
    wow okay I didn’t even get to take the stuff outta my bag…”
  
 
  Steve had turned around once more, but this time he actually got out of his “chair”.
 
  “Are you really going to be like that to your guest, Michelle?” 
 
  “
  What are you, my dad?!
  ”, Michelle cried.
 
  Everyone 
  
    just kind of existed
  
   for a moment, upon remembering that yes, Minecraft Steve 
  
    was
  
   Michelle’s dad.
 
  With the unchanging face he always had, Steve finally broke the silence.
 
  “Yes. Yes I am.”, he said squarely. “So if you aren’t going to let Ian in, I will.”
 
  “
  STEVE, NO!
  ”, shouted Rio.
 
  “Why? Is he gonna summon The Wither in here or something!?” Steve slapped at the air, and the door snapped open. 
 
  Ian could never get used to the sight of Michelle’s Dad. Some things in this world were stranger than anime ever could be… like, for instance, this rather square fellow by the name of Steve. His mouth didn’t even move when he spoke! But once you got past that, he was quite the upstanding chap.
 
  “Oh, do come inside!”, said Steve squarely, “You said you had something for Michelle?”
 
  Ian stared at Michelle. She didn’t like the look he was giving her. 
 
  “
  OF COURSE!”
  , bellowed Ian, “I’m the guest here! How could I forget to bring… ”

  Ian had pulled out a king-sized bag of Bob’s Sweet Stripes, her second favorite thing in the entire observable universe (right behind Melia Antiqua). 
 
  “
  THE MINTS!!!

  “
  Oh God, here we go…

 “I have brought mine tithes for Thee, Milady… ”, said Ian, like a true degenerate, attempting to present the peppermints. 
  “
  
    AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!
  
  ” Unfortunately for him, Michelle had other ideas, as she snatched the bag from his hands!
 
  “
  MIII-Chelle, you shouldn’t!!

  “
  MINT! MINT! MINT! MINT! MINT! MINT! MINT!
  ” Michelle chanted, rolling around on the floor with the bag. 
 
  “And why is that, Rio?”, asked Ian.
 
  “

    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!
  
  ” She gnawed on the bag.
 
  “Well, Michelle hasn’t told me anything about that…”, said Steve, squarely.
 
  “
  Well, ah… that’s because.
  ” Fortunately (or unfortunately), Rio was interrupted by the ripping of the bag. Michelle crammed the candies into her mouth by the fistful!
 
  “
  ARE YOU EATING THE MINTS WITH THE WRAPPERS STILL ON THEM!?
  ”, cried “Elizabeth”.
 
  “
  And you don’t eat 
  
    your
  
   MINT with the peels on!?
  ”, said Michelle, in a brief moment of lucidity.
 
  “
  THE PEELS?!
  ”
 
  “The peels are the best part!
  ”  
 
  “MOVIN’ ON THEN…”, said Ian,  “What else do I have here… oh. OF COOOOURSE!”
 
  “
  
    Please don’t be pickle chips, PLEASE DON’T BE PICKLE CHIPS!!
  
  
    ”
  
  , muttered Michelle.
 
  “
  So what is it?
  ”, asked “Elizabeth”.
 
  Ian stared blankly off into space. Slowly, he pulled something white and blue out of the bad.

  “
  
    Doo DahDahDah DahDahDah Dah…
  
  ”, he hummed, rather terribly. Somewhere deep within Michelle, a primal instinct burst forth. 
 
  “
  BLLLLLLLLLLLLLLAH!!
  ” Michelle continued the acapella, as Ian had pulled out:
 
  
    WII. SPORTS. RESORT.
  
 
  “YEAAAAAAAH!”, cheered Ian.
 
  “
  YEAAAAAAH!!
  ”, cheered Michelle.
 
  “UH OHHHHHHHHHHHH!” 
 
  Rio stooped over Michelle, who was still on the floor.
 
  “
  Have you 
  
    COMPLETELY 
  
  lost your mind, Michelle!?
  ” Michelle shot up.
 
  “
  Maybe I have, Rio.”, she said, “Anyways, the Wii’s McFucking busted after Verrie tried to jailbreak it and use the Wii to hack into the IRS and destroy them once and for all, so we’re gonna have to use the Wii U.
  ”
 
  “
  
    Dear God…
  
  ”, muttered Ian.
 
  “
  I know, right, who would unironically want to play on a Wii U? Us, apparently.
  ” 
 
  She booted it up and turned on the TV. Ian passed around WiiMotes to everybody and turned his on.
 
  “
  Alright.
  ”, said “Elizabeth”. But someone else wasn't as willing to oblige...
 
  “
  No… thanks.
  ”, said Rio.
 
  “BUT RIIIIIIIIIIIIIO,” cried Ian, “It’s Four-Player!”
 
  “
  I, ah…
  ” 
 
  “
  
    Pwease~
  
  ” Michelle was looking at them like she was about to cry. Rio knew that was probably just the Bob’s Soft Mints talking, but they just couldn’t help but feel for their friend.
 
  “
  okay, fiiiiiiiiiine
  ” And with that, Rio picked up the fourth remote.
 
  “So if this darned contraption is the Wii 
  
    U
  
  , the Miis Michelle and I made last time aren’t gonna be there. Looks like I’ve registered as P1, you guys just want to see my terrible interpretation of all of you?!”  
 
  “
  No
  ”, said “Elizabeth” flatly.
 
  “
  TOO~ BAD!!
  ”, blared Ian with a doofy grin. He opened up the Mii Channel.
 [Recommended Listening: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9s1ltPGQOo]  
  “Time to make ugly Miis”, Ian chortled.
 
  “
  Do they have to be ugly, specifically?
  ”, asked “Elizabeth” disdainfully.
 
  “
  
    It’s funnier that way, you nerd.
  
  ”
 
  “
  
    They’re all beautiful in their own right…~
  
  ”, said Michelle singsongingly.
 
  “I go first.” Ian speedran the Mii Channel and made his own character within a minute. Somehow, it looked decent. For whatever reason, Ian ominously hovered over orange for the “favorite color” for a couple seconds before switching over to black. Clearly, this was a sign. Ooh, spooky!
 
  “Who’s P2?”, asked Ian.
 
  “
  Uhh. The second light on my remote is lit up. Does that mean I’m ‘Pee Two?’
  ”
 
  “Yeh”
 
  “
  Thun thun thun. Thun thun thun. Bah, nah, noh...
  ” Michelle sang along to the Mii Channel Theme.
 
  “YOUR TURN, Elizabeth!” Ian resumed his rapid clicking.
 
  “
  Ian, I don’t look like that!
  ”, she cried. Despite being a blank slate with nothing resembling a personality or emotions, the Mii character seemed to be sternly disappointed.
 
  “Yes you do!” Elizabeth was looking at Ian with the same deadpanned expression as the Mii character was, yet it had failed to dawn on her. 
 
  “SEE!?”, said Ian, “Who’s next?!”
 
  “
  I think that’d be me…
  ”, said Rio nervously.
 
  “ALRIGHTY, then.” Rapid Mii Channel Clicking ensued once more. Michelle could’ve sworn she heard trance music for a racing game.
 
  “
  why. why do I look like that.
  ”, asked Rio.

  “You’re making The Face™”, said Ian, pronouncing the trademark audibly.
 
  “
  The Face™?
  ”
 
  “You know. 😲.”
 
  “
  Ian, how did you pronounce an emoji?
  ”
 
  “Then that leaves… MEACHEL.”, said Ian, dodging the question like Keanu Reeves in 
  
    The Matrix
  
 
  “
  Thm, thm, -- 
  
    Myes?
  
  ” Michelle stopped singing along to the Mii Channel Song.
 
  “
  
    It’s-a your turn!
  
  ”
 
  “
  Oh boy, I can’t wait to be brutally roasted.
  ”
 
  The glasses on Michelle’s Mii covered up her eyebrows.
 
  “
  Oh no, where did my eyebrows go?
  ”
 
  “That’s a good question, where did they go, Michelle?” Once again, Ian paused for no reason on the final screen. This time, however, he hovered over light blue before rushing over to dark green. Again, a sign. Oooooh! Spooky!
 
  “That’s all of ‘em.”, said Ian, “Unless… Hey, Steve!”
 
  “Count me out.”, he said squarely. That lever must have been very important business.
 
  “Alrighty then,” replied Ian, “that’s all of ‘em!”
 
  “
  What about Verde?
  ”, asked “Elizabeth”.
 
  “She isn’t here, isn’t she, Michelle?”, said Ian.
 
  “
  Oh right,”, Michelle replied, “she’s got conspiracy to commit murder going on today.
  ”
 
  “
  As one does…
  ”, said “Elizabeth” wearily.
 
  “
  what? are you implying you 
  
    don’t
  
   commit various crimes on a daily basis
  ?”, said Rio.

  “
  TIME FOR RESORT.
  ”, bellowed Ian.
 
  “
  
    The resort time!!
  
  ”, squeed Michelle, her excitement third only to that of her reactions to Melia Antiqua and 
  LORD RODOLFO
  . “Elizabeth” and Rio looked at each other in sympathy of each other as the other two began chanting the title theme. 
 
  “
  DOOT. DOOT. DOODOODOODOODOOOO”
 
  “
  DOODOODOODOO, DOODOODOODOODOODOO
  ”
 
  “Last time, we only got up to Golf. Ya wanna say we start off this round with Bowlin’?”
 
  “
  Are we not playing the minigames in order?
  ”, asked “Elizabeth”.
 
  “It’s gonna mess with tha continuity!”, barked Ian.
 
  “
  YEAH,
  ” said Michelle, only to be interrupted by Ian screaming “
  UH OH!
  ”. She resumed:
 
  “
  The continuity! It’s important! You’d miss out on all of the epic Wii Sports Resort Lore in the plane game otherwise!
  ”
 
  “
  
    VVVVERY NAISU, MEACHEL-CHAN!!
  
  ”, chimed Ian, as if to applaud Michelle’s passion for resort-themed minigame collections.
 
  “
  is that a motherfucking joe joe reference, Ian?
  ”, snarkily asked Rio.
 
  “
  YES
  .”, said Ian, ecstatic that someone actually asked that. Unfortunately, it seemed that Rio was 
  
    not
  
   a Jojo’s fan. 
 
  “
  Well… 
  
    try not to do that, it’s 
  
  
    annoying
  
  
    .
  
  ” Once again, the fury had returned to Rio’s voice. Ian had picked the “100-Pin Bowling”  game by accident, instead of the regular bowling. The continuity was at stake!
 
  “Oh, shoot, ah… Fuck it.”, said Ian. “Well this game is interestin’, I think it was in the first one’s ‘Trainin’ Mode’?”
 
  “
  The  
  
    first one
  
  ?
  ”
 
  “
  OH BOY, TIME TO MANSPLAIN.
   It’s ‘Wii Sports Resort’. The ‘Resort’ is just a fancy ‘2’. ‘Wii Sports’ was a launch title for the Wii, meaning it came out on the same day as the console did. What we’re playing now is the sequel to that. Anyways, 
  
    Elizabeth
  
  , it’s your turn now.”

  “
  how. how do I go?
  ”, said Elizabeth, her character frantically shaking the bowling ball back and forth.
 
  “
  How do you ‘go’? Eli, you gotta hold the 
  
    back button
  
   when you swing!
  ” 
 
  “‘
  
    Eli?’
  
  ” Rio pulled out their phone. They seemed upset about something. 
 
  “‘
  
    Elizabeth
  
  ,’ yes. That’s what I said.
  ”
 
  “Elizabeth” then threw the ball backwards.
 
  “
  WAOW!
  ”, said Ian, along with the in-game characters.
 
  “
  Have you ever even 
  g a m e d
   before in your life!?
  ”, Michelle asked.
 
  “
  Well, no…
  ”, replied “Elizabeth”.
 
  “And that’s okay.”, said Ian. “It takes time to learn things, vidya bidyas included.”

  “
  Uh-huh.
  ” “Elizabeth” threw the ball the 
  
    correct
  
   way, and got all but one pin!
 
  “
  OH, COME ON!
  ”, she cried.
 
  “Better than what I got! You’re doing great for your first time!”, said Ian. “Anyways, Rio’s up.”
 
  “
  no i’m not
  ” They were looking at pictures of an animated hippopotamus on their phone.
 
  “But… it’s your turn?”
  
    
    
  

  “
  i’m busy.
  ” Clearly, Moto Moto meant more to Rio than Wii Sports Resort ever would.
 
  “Well... 
  
    Then I’ll go for ya! Guhehehe!
  
  ” Ian said as he snatched the Wiimote from off of the floor! 
 
  “
  Isn’t that rather rude?
  ”, asked “Elizabeth”.
 
  “They said no, therefore, 
  
    it’s my go
  
  !”, said Ian, shifting Rio’’s character all the way over to the right of the bowling lane.
 
  “
  HERE I GO MANSPLAINING AGAIN.
  ” 
 
  “
  At least you’re honest with yourself about it.
  ”
 
  “So, ah, if I remember correctly,”, mansplained Ian, as men typically did, “if you can get the ball to stay on the rail, you get an instant strike if it reaches the end.”
 
  “
  Uh-huh.
  ”, said Michelle. Ian, however, was not that good at video games. The ball plummeted off the side of the railing and into the gutter.
 
  “
  Why would I do 
  
    nerd stuff
  
   like that when I can do 
  
    this!
  
  ”, Michelle cried.
 
  The Wiimote zoomed from her arm, clinging for dear life by the wrist strap as all 100 pins keeled over! The replays were just the icing on the cake!

  “NICE!”, shouted Ian.
 
  “
  NICE!
  ”, shouted Michelle.

   
   

  “
  
    woooo
  
  ”, said Rio sarcastically.
 
  “Is somethin’ up, Rio?”
 
  “
  One would think you, OF ALL PEOPLE, should know 
  
    exactly
  
   what’s ‘up’, 
  Ian.
  ”
 
  “Bold of you to assume I know 
  
    anything
  
  . 
  
    Oi!
  
   It’s my turn again!” Ian turned his character all the way to the left. “Trick shot!”, said Ian.
 
  “
  Aren’t you going to waste your turn doing that?
  ”, asked “Eliazbeth”.
 
  “
  
    Trick Shot.
  
  ”, said Michelle, with intent.
 
  “Trick Shot!”, yelled Ian. The ball bounced off the walls several times. It looked cool, but it barely hit half of the pins. “We observe the hubris of man.”
 
  “
  There’s gonna be a lot more ‘hubris’ for you than losing Wii Bowling, 
  Ian.
  ”, said a rather agitated Rio.
 
  “Seriously, Michelle, what’s their deal?”, Ian asked.
 
  “
  beats me lmao
  ”, said Michelle, saying “lmao” out loud.
 
  “ Elizabeth” got a spare. Nice!
 
  “
  Did you really just say ‘lmao’ out loud?
  ”, she asked Michelle.
 
  “
  Maybe I did lmao
  ”, saying “lmao” out loud again.
 
  “lmao” It had spread to Ian.
 
  “
  lmao
  ” 
 
  They continued back and forth for a bit, which was rather unnerving. The rest of the game wasn’t much to write about. Ian never did get the easter egg strike, and like always, Michelle won. 
 
  “So which one are we playing next?”, asked Ian. Michelle seemed out of it for a moment, and Rio still seemed rather ornery. Slowly, Michelle turned towards Ian.
 
  “
  none of them-
  ”, she hollowly said.
 
  “Whaa?”, cried Ian.
 
  “
  
    None. Of. Them.
  
   Don’t you get it, Ian?
  ”
 
  “No…?”
 
  “
  Look at the clock, Ian.

    Chugga Time

  “Aw,

  “No?”

  “

  “But isn’t your dad is working there?!” The lever-flicking had stopped.
 
  Steve sighed, squarely, of course. “If Chuggaaconroy is 
  
    that
  
   important to the two of you, I suppose take my work upstairs for a little while.” Steve punched at the lever and it popped off of the desk after a few seconds.
 
  “
  
    yes Mr. Stephen that would be very lovely
  
  ”, said Ian hurriedly as Michelle was already logging on to the computer.

  
  

  “Alright then.” Steve did exactly that, and took the lever upstairs to his room. Even from downstairs, the endless flicking could be faintly heard.
 
  “
  Go go go go!

  “You two!”, barked Ian, “Get over here!”

  “

  “
  HEY EVERYBODY!! It’s Chuggaaconroy!! Welcome back to, KIRBY PLANET ROBOBOT!! Last time, we made our way through Gigabyte Grounds and went through a quite nostalgic level, this time…
  ” 
 
  “Rio, you’re missing Chuggaa Time
  ®
  !!
  ”, squeed Michelle.
 
  “
  maybe I’ll just catch up later…
  ”
 
  Half an hour had passed, thus Chuggaa Time was done for the day, much as Rio Goddamn Crichton was done with their life.
 
  “
  
    You guys having fun over there?~
  
  ”, Rio said with an entire kilogram of sarcasm
 
  “
  Why, do you have somewhere to be?
  ”, asked “Elizabeth”
 
  “
  Yeah. Not Here.
  ”, muttered Rio.
 
  “I want din din”, said Ian sternly.
 
  “
  But we don’t have enough here for three guests!”, Michelle worriedly said.
 
  “Oh, no”
 
  “
  We should go out, then.
  ”, said Elizabeth.
 
  “
  If we did that I’d have to ask my dad…”, said Michelle, before standing before the stairwell. “
  
    DAAAAAAD!!
  
  ”, she cried.
 A very muffled (and square) “yeah sure just be back before Verde is done with crimes” came from upstairs. 
  “But where’re we gonna 
  
    go
  
  ?”, asked Ian.
 
  “
  Olive Garden.
  ”, said Michelle.
 
  “
  Why there, specifically?
  ”, asked “Elizabeth”
 
  “It's a JoJo reference?”, said Ian.
 
  “
  
    Please
  
   stop-

  “I cannot and I will not, 
  
    Crichton
  
  .”
 
  “
  Nah fam, we gotta go to the Ol’ O.G. ‘cause they have MINT.
  ”
 
  “It’s settled. But how are we gonna get to Olive Garden?”
 
  “
  You have a car now, don’t you?
  ” Michelle said as she pointed to the silver Honda parked outside.
 
  “What car?” said Ian, sweating. 

  “
  The Silver Honda that you fucking came here in.
  ”
 
  “
  
    That’s… Elizabeth’s car…
  
  ” Granted, as a carbon-based life form, Ian was virtually always sweating, but it seems this moment he was caught in a lie.
 
  “
  But of course, you can still drive to Olive Garden in it, 
  
    can’t you, Ian?
  
  -”, said “Elizabeth”.
 “A.a...lright.”, he said, nervously.
  “
  Is he doing okay?
  ”, asked 
 
  “
  I’M DEPRESSED!

  “

  “

  ”
 
  “
  Блять!
   What are we supposed to do now?!

  “
  Go to dinner tonight and pray to RODOLFO that Ian turns out okay.”, said Michelle. “Knowing what happened the 
  
    last time
  
   Teto took someone under her wing, Ian, uh… Ah ha ha hah, it’s best not to think about that

  “
  But what about INA?”, asked Michelle, “How are we to avoid him?
  ”
 
  “
  Thankfully, there seem to be some sort of rules to the personality swap. Apparently, INA didn’t happen around Luka, although 
  
    maybe
  
   that was because Ian’s first impression of her wasn’t all that negative. INA, then, must come out when Ian feels threatened, or something to that effect
  ”
 
  “
  Great.”, said Michelle. “Don’t spook him, don’t piss him off…
  ”
 
  “
  If we don’t get in the car soon,”, said Rio, “Ian’s gonna get worried, won’t he?
  ”
 
  “
  I clearly said ‘seems’. INA has randomly come out, too. However, this INA only emerges when Ian’s around Neru, but without Teto being involved. I’ve only seen it a couple times, but it’s like he blacks out in the middle of a sentence, and then--
  ” Unfortunately, Eli was interrupted by an obnoxious honking
 
  
    HONK!HONK!HONK!HONK!HONK!HONK!
  
 
  Ian was slamming on the car’s horn. It looks like it was time for the three of them to go.
 
  “
  we’ll finish later.

  For now, it was time… 
  for Olive Garden.

  “

    emoted
  
   for the first time in quite a while, agitated with the UTAU’s antics.

  Olive Garden
 
  At long last, the party had arrived… at Olive Garden… A hostess greeted them.
 
  “
  
    Hi, Welcome to Olive Garden™! When You’re Here, You’re FAMILY™!
  
  ” The hostess had the usual “perky on the outside, completely dead on the inside” as most retail or food service workers had. Ian couldn’t blame her. He’d been in similar boats.
 
  “
  
    How many are we having today?
  
  ”, asked the hostess. Ian looked around behind him, as if to check if they were being followed.
 
  “Eh, I’d say four.”
 
  “
  
    And booth or table?”
  
 
  “Whatch’y’all want?”, Ian asked, but only Michelle responded.
 
  “
  Either is fine.
  ”, she said.
 
  “Booth it is!”, said Ian.
 
  “
  
    Right this way, then…
  
  ”
 
  “
  Ah, DAMT, I left my wallet at home…
  ”
   
 
  “Oi, don’t worry. I’ll cover for you guys tonight! Bee hee hee hee~”
 
  “
  Why are you being this nice to me?
  ”, asked Michelle.
 
  “Oh, just a small price to pay for friendship…”, said Ian, but it seemed to be vaguely ungenuine.
 
   Rio still seemed to be in a bad mood, even under the pretense of free pasta. Who in their right mind wouldn’t be excited for free pasta!?
 
  Eli turned to Michelle. “
  This isn’t going to end well, is it?
  ”, she muttered under her breath. 
 
  The four of them then sat down in the booth. Another host came up to them, a man this time..
 
  “
  
    So what can I get you all to drink?
  
  ”, the host asked.
 
  “You guys got Pepsi, right?”, asked Ian.
 
  “
  
    No sir. We only carry Coke Products.
  
  ” Ian seemed disappointed in the lack of his favorite caramel-coloring-and-high-fructose-corn-syrup-laden-caffeinated sludge.
 
  “Uh, just water, then…”
 
  “
  
    With or without lemon?
  
  ”
 
  “Without.”
 
  “
  And can I get the same?”, asked Eli. “Water with lemon?
  ”
 
  “
  
    And for you two?
  
  ” 
 
  Rio smugly glanced over to Ian before saying, “
  
    Oh! I’ll take the Sparkling San Pellegrino…
  
  ” Something died a little within Ian, as he realized that was nearly eight dollars extra.
 
  “
  Sweet iced tea.
  ”, said Michelle, without a moment of hesitation.
 
  “
  
    Alright, they’ll be up soon.
  
  ” The waiter hurried off to the kitchen.
 
  “So do y'all want any ‘apps’?”
 
  “
  hellllll yeah, babey, I want sum ‘apps’!
  ”
 
  “UH OH!, I mean, uh, nice, yes!”
 
  “
  
    Ooh…
  
  ”, said Rio.
  
     “Why don’t we get the Full Sampler?!
  
  ” That was nearly 15 dollars! But for today, it made sense, there 
  
    were 
  
  four people, after all.
 
  
    “Elizabeth
  
  , have you ever been to one of these before?”, said Ian. But why was Ian still on that fake name? He wasn’t fooling anyone.
 
  “
  I can’t say I have.
  ”, said Eli.
 
  “
  OH
  , the sampler’s got it all, the fried lasagna, the calamari, the, ah--” It was clear what Ian was passionate about, but he had to hold that thought, for the waiter had brought everyone’s drinks.
 
  “
  
    Can I start you all with an appetizer tonight?
  
  ” 
 
  “
  YESSIR!
  ”, barked Ian, “We’ll go with the sampler with -- Oh, what did y’all want on it?”
 
  “
  The calamari sounded nice.
  ”, said Eli.
 
  “The calamari, the lasagna fritta, and the mozzarella sticks.”, said Ian.
 
  “
  
    Great!
  
  ”
 
  “
  I wanted fried ravioli.
  ”, Rio complained.
 
  “
  Two of those things are literally fried cheese.
  ”, rebutted Michelle.
 
  “I know what I’m doing, Michelle.”, said Ian, but he really didn’t know what he was doing.
 
  “
  
    And your entrees tonight?
  
  ”
 
  “
  I might need more time…
  ”, said Eli.
 
  “
  
    Oh, no rush!
  
  ”
 
  “What DO I want to get?...”, Ian asked himself. From somewhere deep inside of him, Ian could’ve sworn he heard a voice. 
 
  “
  The Diamond
  
    , Ian.
  
  ”, it snarled.
 
  “
  Lasaga!
  ”, blurted Ian.
 
  “
  
    NO
  
  
    !!!
  
  ”
 
  “
  LASAGA, WITH EXTRA CHEESE.
  ”, 

  What was that voice’s problem? It sounded kind of like him. Whatever. Ian could wait for therapy. 
   
 
  “
  
    You seem very… passionate… about that, sir.
  
  ”, said the now-nervous waiter
 
  “YES I AM VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT LASAGA.”, barked Ian.
 
  “
  
    Moving on… You two on the right?
  
  ”
 
  “
  I’ll just take the fettucini alfredo…
  ”, said Michelle.
 
  “
  
    Ooh hoo hoo… what do I want…
  
  ”, snickered Rio,
  
     “
  
  Hmm. Ah, 
  
    of course
  
  ! The Shrimp Carbonara looks 
  
    lovely
  
  !~
  ”
 
  “
  
    Great, we’ve got a-

  “HOL’ UP, HOL’ UP!”, Ian interrupted. “Rio, that’s twenty fucking dollars!!”
 
  “
  Hmm!? But it looks 
  
    really good
  
  …~
  ”
 
  “AND I’M A BROKE-ASS COLLEGE STUDENT!” He slammed his fist on the table. “
  
    GET SOMETHIN’ ELSE!!” 
  
  The waiter reacted with astonishment.
 
  “
  Wow!~ Way to treat your guests, Ian!~”, said Rio snidely. “I thought you were paying for us as your 
  
    ‘friends’
  
   and all… 
  ”
 
  “
  Rio.”, said Michelle, like a parent dealing with a rowdy child in public. “
  
    Please.

  “
  Fine. 
  
    Salmon Piccata it is…
  
  ” Their second choice was the 
  
    second-most 
  
  expensive thing on the menu. How classy!
 
  “
  
    Right…”
  
  , said the waiter,
  
     “I’ll be out with your stuff shortly, then…
  
  ” 
 
  Another waitress came by shortly with the breadsticks, but she just as quickly left to staff another table. That left the four of them alone in the booth. 
  WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG NOW?
 
  “Don’t touch 
  
    the sticks
  
   yet…!”, seethed Ian.
 
  “
  And why would that be so important, Ian?
  ”, said Eli.
 
  “Why don’cha find out!?”
 
  “
  Let’s not, and say we did…
  ”, said Michelle morosely. Ian then turned to Michelle, with a seemingly berserk expression in his eyes.
 
  “
  
    Let’s do, but say we didn’t!
  
  ”
 
  “
  Ian, what the hell is 
  
    that
  
   supposed to mean!?
  ”
 
  “Byeh heh hyeh he hah he heh! Coward! It means 
  
    that
  
  -” Thankfully, the waiter had interrupted Ian.
 
  “
  
    Your appetizers, and the salad!”
  
 
  “
  But we didn’t order a salad?
  ”, asked Eli.
 
  “Comes with the entree, don’ it?.”, 
 
  
    “Yes! And the entrees will be out in a bit. Did you decide on something yet, miss?
  
  ”
 
  “
  Uh, I’ll also take the fettuccine…
  ”
 
  “
  
    Fettuccine Alfredo?
  
  ” Ian was already pawing at the app sampler, mildly unnerving Eli with his terrible table manners.
 
  “
  Y-yes, sir.
  ” 
 
  “
  
    Alright then! We’ll try and get that out with the other entrees!
  
  ”

  Eli put some of the salad on her plate, while Ian seemed to be unusually happy about something.
 
  “And now… it is time… for the 
  
    moment of truth
  
  …!”
 
  “
  Reaaaaally don’t like what you’re implying there, 
  
    buddy
  
  .
  ”, said. Rio
 
  “Oh? And what seems to be the problem, 
  
    Rio
  
  ?”
 
  “
  I think you and your 
  
    girrrlll
  
  friend know DAMN WELL what the problem is here!
  ”, sneered Rio.
 
  “
  RIO…
  ”, said Michelle sternly.
 
  “Well guess what, bitch?!”, snapped Ian, “I don’t think 
  
    anyone 
  
  fully understands the problem here…The problem bein’… 
 
  that these breadsticks ain’t got no dippin’ sauce!”
 
  “
  wat.
  ”, said Rio.  

  Ian scooped some of the marinara out of the cup meant for the app sampler and slapped it onto his own plate. 
 
  “Now 
  
    this
  
   is how you Olive Garden™ like an Epic Gamer™” He dipped the breadstick in the sauce, spitefully staring Rio in the eyes the entire time while noshed. 
 
  “(
  
    Strange.)
  
  ” Ian thought to himself. 
  
    “(I don’t remember Rio having blue eyes… Then again, I don’t remember what I had for lunch yesterday, so what the hell do I know!)
  
  ”
  
     
  
 
  “
  But why would you do 
  
    that
  
  ?
  ”, asked Michelle, partially disgusted.
 
  “The real question is -- why not? Live a little!” Ian’s definition of “living”, then, was rather paltry.
 
  “
  You know you could just… 
  
    ask for sauce
  
  , right?
  ”, said Eli.
 
  “But where’s the fun in that?!” Ian was once again cut short by the waiter.
 
  “
  
    Two orders of Fettuccine Alfredo! One Salmon Piccata, and… 
  
  ” He dramatically drew out the last line. 
 “‘Lasagna with extra cheese’. Now, does anybody want parmesan?”  
  “
  YESSIR
  
    !
  
  ”, barked Ian, as if his life depended on the amount of cheese on his shitty, overpriced, microwaved pasta
 
  “
  
    But there’s enough cheese on there already, isn’t there?
  
  ”
 
  “
  NOSSIR.
  ”
 
  
    “A-a-lright, just tell me when there’s enough…
  
  ”
 
   However, Ian did 
  
    not
  
   tell the waiter when there was enough.
  
     Ever. 
  
  He watched, in glee (and the others’ terror) as the waiter continued to shred the 
  
    entire chunk
  
   of Parmesan onto the lasagna, The people in the table across from the four looked on for a moment before returning to their normal, 
  
    sane
  
   lives. 
 
  “Wow, I won!”, said Ian.
 
  “
  
    Nobody has won today. We have all lost this battle.
  
  ”, said the waiter, briefly revealing his dead-inside nature. He then attempted to resume his usual customer service voice. “
  
    If anyone else wants cheese, I’ll have to go to the kitchen to get more…
  
  ”
 
  “
  I think we’re good here.
  ”
 
  “
  
    Alright, just let us know if you all need anything else.
  
  ”
 
  “
  Ian, what in God’s name are you thinking!? How much cheese are you going to eat!?
  ” He seemed distant.
 
  “
  
    Oh boy.
  
  ”, said Rio.
  
     “
  
  It’s happening, isn’t it?

  Ian slowly turned to Eli before piping up.

  “
  ALL OF IT!!!
  ” He slammed his face into the cheese-buried lasagna! In a weird sort of way, Michelle thought it was funny.
 
  “
  Stuffing your face as usual.
  ”, said Michelle. Ian looked up from the lasagna and wiped himself off. He knew 
  
    that
  
  .
 
  “I gotta have a good meal.”, replied Ian without a moment of hesitation. Michelle continued.
 
  “
  Garfield, you fat cat. You are so big and fat. Why are you so fat?
  ” Eli noticed that Rio seemed to be on the verge of a breakdown, but kept the observation to herself.
 
  “I eat, Jon.” Ian furthered the chant. “It’s what I do. It’s time to kick Odie off the table.”
 
  Michelle, as if in a trance, responded “
  Don’t do it, 
  
    Garfield!
  
   That’s our pet dog Odie.
  ” What kind of strange ritual was this?!
 
  “You’re going into orbit, you stupid mutt! 
  KICK

  “

  “
  No, oh no no no no noo, I toooooootaly get

  “(
  
    No. That can’t be right. Rio was a ginger. When were they ever blonde?)
  
  ” Rio slammed their arm on the table!
 
  “
  Why the fuck are we still playing buddy-buddy with Ian after what he did to 
  
    Luka
  
  ?!

  “Oh, no. They said the L-word.”, said Ian. He knew he was fucked. (and not the kind he wanted)
 
  “
  Shut. The Fuck. Up. Cishet.
  ” Michelle, no, 
  
    Miku
  
   turned to 
  
    Rin

    we specifically agreed 
  
  not

  “
  Are we seriously doing this now?”, said Eli. “Right in front of my goddamned salad?

  “
  No one gives a 
  
    shit 
  
  about what you have to say, 
  
    Eli-chi!!
  
  ” Eli’s heart sank in her chest (if she physically had one). Ian had finally noticed the white bow that was the half size of Rin’s head and used all three of his brain cells to piece together what was going on.
 
  “Y-YOU DON’T HAVE TA DO THIS!”, cried Ian.
 
  “
  HOW BOUT I DO ANYWAYS!?
  ” A black-and-gold axe appeared in Rin’s arms. They jumped into the table.
 
  “
  KAGAMINE RIN, HAVE YOU 
  FUCKING
   LOST IT!?
  ”, screamed Michelle. Some of the staff came rushing to, and other customers were staring. The manager of the restaurant tried to reason with them.
 
  “Oh, fuck this shit, I’m out!” Ian murmured before shimming his way out the booth and trying to run away. The crowd that formed, unfortunately, was blocking his exit of the restaurant. “Well shit.”
 
  “
  
    Excuse me, ma’am, you’re gonna have to drop the fire axe!!”
  
 
  
    “
  
  
    Why don’t you fucking MAKE ME!?
  
  ” Rin slammed the axe square into the manager’s shoulder! A surge of electricity shot through the axe, causing it to glow white!
 
  500! 
  Clarissa
   got hurt and collapsed… 
 Ian took one look at the scene unfolding. After they fried the manager of the joint, Rin stood deadlocked in front of the booth, to Miku and Eli’s bewilderment. Kagamine Rin, true name『CV-02-ρ』, snapped their head towards Ian. In a couple minutes, he was going to end up like the manager!! 
  “
  You are SO. Getting fired. For this.
  ”, seethed Michelle. 
 
  “
  Oh, like 
  
    you
  
   aren’t gonna get shit for having a playdate with a 
  
    murderer

  Well… he’s only been doing this because Teto’s forcing him!!

  “
  Again with the Jojo references…

  “
  You’re not getting away that easily, wing-clipper!!
  ” Rin cried, jumping up and shooting through the crowd. They swung like mad, hitting randoes left and right!
 
  “

     get Rin under control…

  “
  I’m coming with!”, she replied, “There’s no point sticking around before the cops come!

    civilians 
  
  may have called the authorities on this whole manner.
 
  “
  OH SHIT, 
  THE PIGGIES!

 “You know how to get your Drive out, right?”  , asked Michelle. 
  “

  “

  “
  GET BACK HERE YOU COWARD!!

  “
  
    No
  
  !”
  , snapped Ian, not watching where he was going.  
 
  “
  Hello there!~”, said Haku in a saccharine voice, “Would you care to explain why you ‘borrowed’ my car 
  
    without permission
  
  ?~

  “THIS AIN’T A GOOD TIME, HAKU.” Miku and Eli finally caught up. Sirens and oinking could be heard in the distance. 
 
  “
  So you 
  
    are
  
   working for them!

  “
  Ian, what the hell is 
  
    she
  
   doing here!?

  “
  Oh.”, murmured Haku, “So you’re not alone. 
  
    Mmm. 
  
  Did you and Miku have fun on your little 
  
    playdate

  “
  
    Time for some 
  
  
    AXE EVASION!!
  
  ” Rin yeeted their axe! But Ian conveniently turned around. 
 
  “
  
    Woah, are those police sirens!?
  
  ”
 
  The axe lodged deep in Ian’s shoulder. 

  400!
 
  “Gwayaaaghhh!” Ian fell down. It couldn’t be electrified without direct contact from Rin. They knew what must be done. However, somebody else had other ideas… 
 
  “
  KAGAMINE RIN.”, bellowed Miku with authority, “IF YOU LAY ANOTHER GODDAMN FINGER ON HIM, I SWEAR TO RODOLFO, 
  
    I’LL CORE YOU MYSELF!!

  “
  You 
  
    do
  
   all realize that I’m standing here?
  ”, asked Haku.
 
  “
  Well we’ll worry about you later, bitch!
  ”
 
  “
  Ah. Suit yourself then.
  ” Haku manifested a handgun. The same gun from that day at the mall. She pointed at the three of them still standing.
 
  “
  
    Decisions, decisions… Who to hit first!? Einee, Mienee, Meinee, 
  
  … Whoh?
  ” 

  To everyone’s bewilderment, Ayase Eli was holding an 
  
    even bigger gun!
  
   She pointed her minigun drive right at Rin!
 
  “
  Get away from Ian!
  ”, she cried.
 
  “
  What, I thought you hated him?
  ”,   The minigun’s barrel started to spin up… 
 
  “
  
    Do you want to end up like Kaito?!
  
  ”
 
  Ian attempted to dislodge the axe from his shoulder, but was distracted by something bigger.
 
  “Oh, great!”, he said sarcastically, “The cops finally showed up!” Two officers hopped out and drew their pistols.
 
  “*snort snort* 
  
    OP-DRAY OUR-YAY AMN-DAY EAPONS-WAY!!

    “
  
  *grunt grunt* 
  
    et-gay away-yay om-fray e-thay an-may on-yay e-thay ound-gray!
  
  ”
 
  Eli did as was told, despite only having a minimal comprehension of Pig Latin, and the minigun powered down and clattered on the ground. Rin was still trying to get to their axe. Haku swiveled her aim over to Ian. The cops both pointed their guns at Rin. The caller 
  
    did
  
   tell dispatch they were the one who maimed the manager, after all…  
 
  The stage had been set.

  I think I should make something clear here: Miku Magdalen Hatsune was
  
     not
  
   one to let her friends stay in danger (even if they did maim two others). The pink, square clips on her twintails gleamed white, and her eyes burned with the fury of the sun. 
 
  “
  Ian… Eli… I’d get down if I were either of you…
  ”, was the last thing Miku said before transforming.
 
  “
  Why?
  ” Four glowing wings erupted from Miku’s back.
 
  “
  
    OH, AWSEY-LAY!”
  
  , squealed one of the cops.
 
  
    “Angels-yay ere-way eal-ray!?
  
  ”
 
  “
  It’s best for you not to find out.”, said Miku. “Alright, just let me handle this…”
 
  “
  I have 
  
    been here
  
   the entire 
  
    goddamn time
  
  , and yet you’re REFUSE to fight me?!

  “
  No one likes you, Yowane!!
  ”
 
  “
  
    I-I-YAY AID-SAY, OP-DRAY E-THAY UN-GAY!

  “
  Why the 
  
    fuck
  
   would I do that!?

  “
  
    OW-HAY E-THAY UCK-FAY IS-YAY E-SHAY

  “
  Well, Haku, if you 
  
    insist
  
  ” Tealish-white piano keys surrounded her.
 
  The officers’ bullets didn’t do anything to hurt Miku, even after being filled with dozens of holes. From a couple of them, a glowing teal liquid that could be likened to ichor trickled out.
 
  “
  You’ll end up just like these two!
  ”
 
  “
  And what’s that supposed to mean?!” Miku seemed to take breath in, tapping a few “keys” before… 
 
  “
  S̸A̸I̸L̵!!
  ” 
  She slammed all of the keys down!! Innumerous beams of light rained from the heavens, striking the cops, their car, and just about anything in the area.!! 
 
  500! 
  Robert
   got hurt and collapsed!
 
  500! 
  Matthew
   got hurt and collapsed!
 
  “Ah. I see.”, said Ian, before a beam struck deep into the top of Haku’s head!
 
  610!
 
  “Well that can’t be good” 
 
  Eli casted a defensive attack and tried to block the rain of lasers with ice. Emphasis is on “Tried to”, as once a single beam hit her frozen shield, it shattered!
 
  “
  Блять!
  ” At least she tried. Another beam hit Eli, tearing right through her, spraying polyester stuffing onto the pavement! 
 
  819!
 
  “
  ha,ra... sho…
  ”, with a puff of some particles, Eli had reverted back into a nesoberi!
  
    
    
  

  “
  
    ERICHI!!
  
  ” Ian reached out. BAD IDEA! The next beam tore right through his left forearm, accompanied by a searing pain like no other!
 
  99! “
  Oh, shit, I hit Ian.
  ” 
  The light barrage stopped.
 
  “
  
    eeeeyaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIGHAHAAHAAAAAA!
  
  ” He writhed in agony for a bit like a little bitch. before trying to crawl over to Eli. 
 
  “
  And I’ll be taking 
  
    that
  
   back!
  ” Rin said, pulling their axe back out of Ian’s shoulder. Blood flowed out of the wound, staining Ian’s grayish polo crimson red! 
 
  “PISS.”, he seethed.
 
  “
  
    Really, Where!?
  
  ”, said Rio, uncharacteristically excited. Ian laughed and looked up. He wagged his finger.
 
  “
  
    None for you, naughty lemonbitch!
  
  ”, Ian chortled.
 
  “
  THAT DOES IT, YOU’VE LIVED LONG ENOUGH!!
  ”, screamed Rin.
 “‘Twas a good run, nary… ”, said Ian in a hokey accent. 
  “
  No, 
  
    that 
  
  does 
  
    it

    leek
  
   dropping right out of the sky! 

  ,

  Rin and Miku swung at the same time!
 
  *Cthunk!* 
  406!
 
  However, it seemed that Miku was the faster of the two. The leek hit right above the knot in their bow. Kagamine Rin dropped to the ground with a “
  Thp
  ”.
 
  “
  A vegetable? Really, twintails?”, said Haku, “Is that what you’ve gone with over all these years? A fucking vegetable?!
  ” Miku, without turning or looking away, pointed the leek at Haku.
 
  “
  You’re next.
  ”, said Miku sternly. Ian saw this as an opportunity to escape! He shuffled over to the neso and picked her up. Now, to get to the car! The two of them were distracted, and Rin was out cold! 
 
  “
  ‘I’m next’!? Are we really gonna have a throwdown? I just came here to get 
  
    my 
  
  car back from that 
  
    coward
  
  !
  ”
 
  “
  
    Your
  
   car? But I thought this was Ian’s car? Is it 
  
    not
  
  ?
  ” A shuffling noise could be heard. Miku looked over Haku. Ian was still flat on the ground, but he was definitely closer to the neso than he was before. What was he trying?
 
  “
  
    News Flash, twintails, it ain’t
  
  .
  ”
 
  “
  Huh?
  ”
 
  “
  Why would Ian have a vanity license that says ‘Y0W4-N3’ on it!? ‘YOWANE’?”
 
  “
  When you put it like that, it makes sense.
  ” “
  OH, DOES IT?
  ” Ian was inching along the ground behind the two. Haku pulled out a flask from one of her pockets and took a deep swig. 
 
  “
  
    That bastard… 
  
  Ah, so Teto says it’s okay, that means it’s 
  
    fine and dandy
  
   to just take 
  
    my 
  
  car without 
  
    my 
  
  permission.
  ” The shuffling noise ensued. Haku didn’t notice it.
 
  “
  Uhhuh
  ”, said Miku. Haku took another sip.
 
  “
  Y’know… He and Neru have been sneakin’ off and locking themselves in the garage a lot…
  ”
 
  “
  They
  
     what?
  
  ” Haku sat down on the asphalt of the parking lot.
 
  “Oh, yeaaah, Ian and Neru keep going off and 
  
    ‘wooorking’ 
  
  on that ‘
  
    superweapon’ 
  
  together...
  ” She chugged the rest of the flask in one swoop, wiping her face with the strange conical sleeve devices the off worlders seemed to all have.
 
  “
  Yowane Motherfucker Haku, what in RODOLFO’S subscriber count are you talking about!?
  ” Ian 
  
    carefully 
  
  reached for the neso.
     
 “But if you ask me, they aren’t building jack! They’re fuckin’, the two of ‘em gotta be fuckin’!~” 
  “
  Haku!
  ”
 
  “
  It’s gotta be 
  
    that
  
  ! Why else would Ian say he can’t 
  
    remember a thing
  
   that goes on in there!? 
  
    Neru’s got mad game.~ Hehehehehehehe…
  
  ”
   Ian pulled backwards slightly.
 
  “
  
    And then Nerrie gets all sad when he leaves, just so they can go do it all over again a couple days later~ hueheheheeeee…
  
  ” Haku
   knocked over the empty flask. 
 
  “
  
    oh, shoot…
  
  ” She finally realized what Ian was up to. Haku stood up (with a bit of work) and looked down on him.
 
  “Aww, didya 
  
    really
  
   think that was gonna work, 
  
    buddy
  
  ?”, Haku said, stumbling. 
  Ian slowly craned his head up. An awkward silence ensued. 
 
  “
  ...Why, yes.” He said matter-of-factly, rocketing towards the Honda!
  
    
    
  

  “
  IAN, WHAT ARE YOU-
  ”, cried Miku.
 
  “
  NIGERUNDAYO, SMOKEY!!!
  ”
 
  “
  Stop 
  
    saying 
  
  the 
  
    n-word
  
  , you’ll get us cancelled on Twitter!!
  ”
 
  “
  no.”
   And with that, Ian threw the nesoberi -- and himself -- into the car. He turned it on and put the gear reverse!
 
  “
  Hey! HEY!!
  ”, cried Haku, clumsily pursuing. Ian pulled down the window and shouted, “
  HAY
   is for 
  HORSES, BITCH BOYYY!
  ” 
 
  He pulled out of the space, and peeled out of there, right past the two of them!! Some nerve! Haku was flabbergasted!
 
  “
  My… car…!!
  ”, she bemoaned
 
  “
  you kinda deserve it tbh
  ”
 
  “
  W-what?
  ” Miku put Rin in a fireman's carry. A hexagonal, turquoise Door appeared behind the two of them. Miku flipped the bird with the arm she wasn’t using.
 
  “
  
    go commit NOT HAVE CAR
  
  ”
 
  “
  What is that even supposed to mean…?”, asked Haku.
 
  “
  IT MEANS I’M BAILING OUTTA THIS JOINT! 
  
    YEET
  
  !!
  ” And with that, the two of them were gone. As well as the Door. It seemed that more police cars were on their way… 
 
  “Well, shit.
  ” Haku noticed something on her phone. Five missed calls from Neru.
 
  “
  Double shit!
  ”

  Kasane Teto was finally done with her “evil plans”. Now, it was time for margarine. She practically rolled down the stairs.
  
    
    
  

  “
  Teheheh… the good stuff…
  ” Unfortunately for Teto, a more-ornery-than-usual Neru was in the kitchen, anticipating the UTAU’s downstairs arrival. It looked like the margarine was going to have to wait.
 
  “
  Oh, what the hell do 
  
    you
  
   want?
  ”, the UTAU sneered.
 
  “
  
    What I want,
  
  ” replied Neru, “is to know where the hell Haku has been all day! She stormed outta your room this morning, and that was the last of her anyone’s saw. I’ve tried calling her, no avail…
  ” She crossed her arms. “
  So what gives?
  ”
 
  “
  Oh, yeah, that one. Uh, she… wanted to go yell at Ian.
  ”
“isn’t home over spring break.” “Yeh.” 
  “
  In the same area also where 
  
    MIKU
  
   is?
  ” “
  Yeh.
  ”
 
  “
  And Ian must’ve at least 
  
    tried
  
   to meet up with Miku, considering that based off the contents of his phone, 
  
    they’re somehow still friends
  
  !?
  ” “
  Can I get the margarine already?
  ”
 
  “
  Aren’t you the 
  
    slightest
  
   bit concerned that, 
  
    oh I don’t know
  
  , HAKU COULD'VE HAD A RUN IN WITH HATSUNE HERSELF!?
  ”
 
  “
  Hasn’t Miku been tied down by the International Baccalaureate for, ehhh, the past five years or so?
  ”
 
  “
  You’re missing the point, Teto.. Ian has likely 
  
    been with 
  
  Miku at some point this week, and if Haku’s going after Ian, while Ian were to currently be 
  
    with 
  
  Miku…
  ”
 “oooooh, THAT’S why you’re pissed today! Ohoho! This game is fun!!”, said Teto giddily. 
  “
  Are you even listening to me!?
  ” “
  No. I never do!”
   “
  UGWH!”
 
  “
  Now please move out of the way. I have margarine to eat!
  ”
 
  Neru noticed something on the granite counter island.
 
  “
  Teto.
  ”
 
  “
  This better be related to water-in-vegetable-oil-emulsions”
 
  “
  No, Teto, 
  
    this
  
   is related to 
  
    that.
  
  ” Neru said, picking 
  
    it
  
   up. 
  Nozomi Snow Halation Nesoberi. 
  “
  Where the fuck did you get this!?
  ”
  
    
    
  

  “
  Haku’s room.
  ”
 
  “
  Oh, what? So you’re gonna make another Construct, as if one one on our plates wasn’t enough.
  ”
 
  “
  Maybe I Will ,And It’s Nunya Goddamn Business.
  ” It was true, the Boukaloid had no power over this nasty bastard gremlin.
 
  “
  If you do, for the love of all that is holy, Do NOT let Eli see Nozomi.
  ” “
  Mmh, why is that?
  ”
 
  “
  DON’T YOU EVEN KNOW THAT THE TWO ARE-
  ” Neru stopped herself as if to avoid something lewd. “
  ...very interested in one another.
  ”

  
  
  

  “‘
  But if Ian finds any of this out, we’d be done for.
  ”
 
  “
  Why would that be?
  ”
 
  “
  For Eli
  
    ,
  
   ‘coming out’ is a breach of life-contract, for Ian… 
  
    how else are we gonna keep him here?
  
  ”
 
  “
  Why are you worrying about 
  
    that?
  
  ”
 
  “
  
    Like he’s not gonna run crying to Miku as soon as he gets the chance… aside from what he’s already doing
  
  ”
 
  “
  I don’t… understand what you’re getting at.
  ” Teto hopped up on one of the bar stools to make herself taller than Neru.
 
  “
  What I’m 
  
    getting at
  
   is if Ian really wanted to be here, 
  
    you two
  
   would have made progress on your magic chainsaw by now. Every other day for the past week and a half now, SOMETHING has been making an awful bunch of knocking around in the garage, 
  
    and it doesn’t sound like any sort of tool, 
  
  ohohoHOHO!
  ”
  
     
  
 
  “
  Teto!
  ”
 
  “
  But seriously. What the hell have you two been up to? Why is there no ‘Anti-Miku Saw’, or whatever you called it?
  ”
 
  “
  There’s a perfectly good reason for that…
  ”
 
  “
  Suuuuure. Look, if you and… Ian are … together, that’s fine, that just means I can get rid of Model M-9, and divert resources… elsewhere.
  ”
 “OH PLEASE, do! The one time I let that wretched thing in here, she tried to lecture me on how ‘McMansions such as your own are a detriment to the overall housing market’ and that ‘the state needs to interfere and seriously rework the system’ and by the end of it all I think she was quoting Das Kapital… But enough about her.” 
  “
  
    Hmmm?
  
  ”
 “Without Eli, or without you, Ian seems to be… oh how do I put this, a lot better at things? For one, he stops acting like a complete dumbass, and starts being useful for once. Not to mention his personality does a one-eighty and--” 
  “
  We get it, Neru, 
  
    we get it!
  
   You and Ian are ‘definitely not fucking’! Now are you ever gonna put the damn chainsaw together, let alone let me get my RODOLFO-saken margarine!?
  ”
 
  “Are YOU ever going to do anything with 
  
    Nozomi?
  
  ”, asked Neru. An awkward silence lingered.

  “
  ...
  ”
 
  “
  ...
  ”
 
  “
  Touché.
  ”, said Teto. Neru sighed before walking off. “
  Just get your fucking margarine…
  ”
 “YAAAY!~”, cheered Teto.   
  All was going according to keikaku [Translator’s note: 
  
    keikaku 
  
  means plan]. Eli was still in line, and if she…  
  
    happened to fail to uphold her end of the contract
  
  , then this new toy could be a perfectly suitable replacement! To think, Model M-
  
    8
  
  ! At this rate, Teto would have the entire set by the end of the year! And if Neru 
  
    was
  
   being serious about her “magic chainsaw”, 
  
    and if Ian were to sneak that thing into Miku’s House
  
  , then Miku Hatsune’s days were certain to be numbered. The best part of it all:
 
  Neru finally let Teto have her margarine. This pleased the UTAU. 
 
  “
  Haha, yes, marmgarmin
  ”, she muttered in between spoonfuls of butter substitute spread.

  Buckingham Park, #130
 
  Ian’s mother was on her laptop. Attempting to work on lesson plans, she kept getting interrupted by emails from administration. Apparently, the County management couldn’t be helped to not hit “Reply All” whenever having as much as a minor conversation. This matter was only made more irritating by the noises from the TV. Lucas, her younger son, was on The Nintendo™ again, playing Fortnite (or whatever it was the kids were into). “
  
    Whatever.
  
  ”, she would say, not concerning herself with any of that matter. As long as it was semi-innocent, not costing any money, and made Lucas happy, it was fine in her book. Something else, however, was about to interrupt her lesson planning.
 
  Ian, and his new girlfriend, came home. Admittedly, it was a bit strange having her over for a whole week. Sure, it was nice that Ian had finally found someone “for him”, but something about Elizabeth seemed… of. Sure, she 
  
    was 
  
  studying abroad from Russia, although Ian’s mother found it odd that she never specified what school specifically. Russia was the largest country in the world, right? Surely, there had to be more than one college!? Not to mention, if she 
  
    was
  
   from Moscow, why did Elizabeth look more 
  
    Asian
  
   than 
  
    European
  
  ? Something didn’t stack up here, but Ian’s mother had neither the time NOR the energy to pursue anything.

  What was important 
  
    now
  
   was why Ian looked so upset tonight. Ian’s mother closed down the laptop.
 
  “
  
    So how was you two’s hangout with Michelle?
  
  ”, she asked.
 
  “Fine.”, said Ian rather hastily. “
  
    PEACHY KEEN!
  
  ”
 
  “
  
    Buddy, you don’t look like it was fine.
  
  ”
 
  “Everything. is. fine! If anybody needs me I’m off to bed!” said Ian in a hurry, trying to storm off to his room.
 
  “
  
    What… is that on your arm? What happened?!
  
  ” 
 
  “Critical Linguine Failure.”
 
  “
  
    That doesn’t make any sense!
  
  ” “Elizabeth” remained silent and just shook her head at Ian..
 
  “And it didn’t. Good Night!”
 
  “
  
    Why is the back of your shirt ripped up!? That was a perfectly good shirt!
  
  ”
 
  “Well then, tell that to Rio, 
  who showed up 
  
    uninvited
  
  !”
 
  “
  
    Ian, buddy, what’s wrong?
  
  ”
 
  “Hell if I know!” Ian shouted, slamming the door behind him. Lucas was still playing Fortnite, seemingly unaware of what was going on.
 
  “
  It’s, um… complicated.
  ”, muttered “Elizabeth”.
 
  “
  
    ...complicated?
  
  ”
 
  “
  Tonight would have been certainly better if Rio hadn’t tagged along.
  ”
 
  “Rio
  
    !? Michelle’s friend? Did she do that to-”
  
 
  “
  
    I think Rio prefers ‘they’...
  
  ”
  
    
    
  

  
    “Yeah yeah yeah, whatever. Did 
  
  they
  
     do that to Ian?
  
  ”
 
  “
  Yes.
  ”
 
  “
  
    For Christ’s Sake, then, why didn’t you or Michelle call the police!?”
  
 
  “
  The police wouldn’t be able to stop that thing.
  ”
 
  “
  
    T-that thing? Ellie, what is that supposed to MEAN?
  
  ”
 
  “
  It means… nevermind. I’m going to try to talk some sense to Ian and get him to come back out.
  ”
 
  “...”
 
  
    “Please do, it’s terrible to see him like this. It’s bad enough with one that won’t talk to mee.”
  
   “
  I’ll say.
  ” Eli walked towards the end of the apartment, where Ian’s room was. The Royale Match ended and Lucas was booted out, giving him time to partake in The Real World™ for about ninety seconds. He noticed Eli walking by. What Lucas said was… moderately concerning.
 
  “
  
    W e e f u.
  
  ”, the child moaned. Ian had said at one point that that’s what Lucas referred to all anime characters as. But why was he pointing at Eli and saying that? Teto said “normal humans” wouldn't be able to get past whatever… memetic shield thingamabob? Eli didn’t know what that meant, only that this... phenomenon allowed the Cryptloidians to enter Earthen society (and enroll in the International Baccalaureate program at Midlothian High School, of all things). Purportedly, Teto had given Eli a shield as well, but it seems that either A). Eli’s was now failing, B). Lucas was somehow able to bypass the memetic effects, or C). Lucas was just a literal 12 year old on the Autism Spectrum and thus unable to effectively differentiate the concepts of “2-D Anime Waifu” and “3-D Human Girlfriend”. Hopefully, the answer was “C.”

  
  

  Eli opened the door, and Ian was lying face down-up the bed. He was staring up at the ceiling and seemed like he was about to cry.
 
  “
  ... are you doing alright?
  ”, Eli asked hesitantly.
 
  “That’s a good question.”, muttered Ian.
 
  “
  You don’t even know if you’re doing alright?
  ” “nope” 
 
  “
  That would mean that you aren’t, then..
  ” “oh no”
 
  “
  ‘Oh no’?
  ” “
  
    Oh No.
  
  ” Eli sat on the end of the bed.
 
  “
  Why do you keep saying that?
  ”
 
  “I’d say I feel pretty ‘Oh No’ these past few weeks.”
 
  “
  How come?
  ” “
  WHERE DO I START?
  ” Ian sat up.
 “Let’s unpack this. My best friend of what is it now, two and a half years, IS ACTUALLY from space, and is some kind of… magical girl idol robot? I dunno! Some of her adversaires have, like, hired me or somethin’, which pissed her IB friends off, and now they, or at least three of ‘em so far, want me dead.” 
  “
  How is that ‘Oh No’?
  ”
 
  “Eli, 
  they want me dead
  . If I’m dead and in Hell, I ain’t gonna be able to watch Chuggaaconroy’s videos.”
 
  “
  Chuggaaconroy sure is important.
  ”, said Eli with absolutely no sarcasm involved.
 
  “
  
    But
  
  , to make matters worse, 
  
    you’re here
  
  ” “
  What? Is that not a good thing?
  ”
 
  “Pf! Not for you, it ain’t! 
  You’re trying to tell me somethin; important
  , 
  
    right
  
  ? But for whatever reason, ya can’t tell me. 
  
    Teto
  
   doesn’t want you to tell me. Gawd. 
  
    Teto
  
  . She creeps me out! All short people do, but especially her. Ya know, Neru says she’s the one in charge over there, but I 
  
    really
  
   think Teto is the one calling the shots. She actually...” 
 
  “
  Sorry for interrupting, but go back to the first part?
  ”
 
  “You need to say something important, and that important thing is detrimental to Teto in some way.”
 
  “
  How did you figure that out?
  ”
 
  “Pfaaah! Why else would you cry over 
  
    CHIPOTLE!?
  
   Come on, we’ve had better Mexican food at the fucking dining hall!”
 
  “
  I’m honestly surprised...
  ”
 
  “Oh, right, I’m supposed to be the dumb one.”, said Ian nonchalantly. He turned over and reached underneath the bed. 
 
  “
  
    Time for Bepsis!
  
  ” He beamed, pulling out a can of Pepsi. Just a plain one, though. Ian cracked it open and took a swig. 
 
  “
  How… long has that been under there?
  ”, said Eli, mortified. 
 
  “I dunno. It’s completely flat… This was a bad idea.” 
 
  “
  Do you have any 
  
    good ideas
  
  ? Preferably on how to get us out of this mess?
  ” “‘Us’?”
 
  “
  I’d like to have freedom, too, 
  
    if you don’t mind..
  
  ”
 
  “Eh, I’d give ya that, but it seems Lil’ Miss Po-Teto is hell-bent on keepin’ yer secret a secret at the expense of your life! What am I supposed to do ta 
  
    that
  
  !?”

   Eli noticed something about Ian.
 
  “What’s wrong?”, he spat. 
 
  “
  You!
  ” “Watanabe?” “
  No, 
  
    Ian! 
  
  Your back!
  
    ” 
  
  “What about it?”
 
  “
  When you got that can… the scar on your back…
  ” “A scar?” “
  
    From the axe Rin wedged in you!
  
  ” “Oh, right, how could I forget about that.”
  
     
  
 “Did you seriously forget that you got fucking gored?”, snapped Eli. “Probably.” 
  “
  The axe wound is gone! It’s barely been an hour. Human bodies aren’t supposed to do that sort of thing. And the area healed doesn’t look like any sort of natural color. Was it… orange?!
  ”
 “The wonders Pepsi® Max can do for the body…”, Ian beamed. 
  “
  The wound was gone 
  
    before
  
   you drank any of that!
  ”
 
  “Ah, well, maybe it’s 
  
    maaagic~
  
  . Actually,
  
     on second thought
  
  , I hope it isn’t magic. I don’t think I have a magic permit!”
 
  “
  Shouldn’t you get that checked out?
  ” Ian stared at Eli for a moment.
 
  “
  
    PFUHAHAHAHAHA! 
  
  Yeah, right! Go to the
  
     hospital!
  
   In 
  this
   economy?” This wasn’t going to work. Eli had to try something else
   “You know, if he were in our boat, what would JoJo do?” 
  “‘JoJo’?”, inquired Ian. 
 
  “
  From 
  
    JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure
  
  ” Ian had a haughty throat clear.
 
  “
  *HEH HEM
  *
   THERE’S EIGHT OF THEM,
   YOU UNCULTURED SWINE!!”
 
  “
  What would JoJo Number…  4 do…?
  ” “Make Mista Cry.”
 
  “
  Other than 
  
    that
  
  … 
  
    (what even is a ‘Mista’?!)
  
   Who 
  
    is
  
   JoJo Number 4?
  ” “Josuke Higashikata.”, stated Ian.
 
  “
  Alright, and what do 
  
    you
  
   think 
  
    Josuke
  
   would do, given this situation?
  ” “What would Josuke do?”, asked Ian, almost transfixed. 
 
  “
  Yes, what do you think Josuke would do in our situation?
  ”
 
  “...
  
     What would Josuke do…?
  
  ”
 
  “
  You were supposed to answer that.
  ”
 
  “I wouldn’t know that because I’m not Josuke!”
 
  “
  Wouldn’t you know what he’s like from watching the show?
  ”
 “No, because the characters in Jojo’s aren’t real!” Something about those last two words really sunk into Eli. 
  “
  Well, you have fun with that.
  ” Eli got up, disappointed, and went back to the living room. Hopefully, Lucas was done playing Fortnite by now.
 
  “
  
    So did you get anything out of him?
  
  ”, asked Ian’s mother.
 
  “
  No.
  ”, said Eli.
 
  “
  
    Typical. If you don’t mind me asking, what exactly went down tonight? With Michelle and Rio? ...Is Michelle
  
   jealous
  
     that you’re with Ian now?
  
  ”

  “
  Oh no, no, it’s not that.
  ”
 
  “
  
    Then what’s their problem
  
  ? 
  
    Why on God’s Green Earth did Rio feel compelled to attack him?
  
  ”
 
  “
  Like I said, it’s complicated. I don’t really know myself.
  ”
 
  “
  
    I just don’t get it. He’s doing great at school, made good friends, 
  
  finally got a girl to go out with him after several years
  
    …
  
  ” The last line made Eli internally cringe. He knew damn well that whatever went down at Potomac Mills didn’t count as a 
  
    date
  
  ! What had Ian been telling his mother!?
 
  “
  I worry about him sometimes…
  ”, muttered Eli. Ian’s mother seemed upset.
 “‘Sometimes’. You know, I’ve been worrying about him a whole lot more than ‘sometimes’. Even if he’s doing spectacular, I just can’t shake this feeling that something terrible is going on at Mason that he isn’t going to tell me about…”
  
  “
  You could say that again…
  ” “...
  
    Pardon?
  
  ”

  Yes, we are more than physically capable of removing Ian from the world, but in doing so, there’s a high risk that we’d cause INA to activate. We don’t know what

  “
  
    Michelle, hurry up! Governor Northam’s has a special announcement to make!
  
  ” “
  Okay, mom…
  ”
 
  The Governor Of Virginia, Ralph Northam, strode up to the podium on-screen.
 
  “Here he goes…”, said Steve, s q a r e l y.
 “{I’ve come to make an announcement:}”, boomed the Governor, will all the authority of The Commonwealth, “{The Novel Coronavirus is a bitch-ass motherfucker!}”  
  “
  
    Can he even say that on TV?
  
  ”
 “{It’s infected over 700 Virginians so far. That’s Right. COVID-19 took its viral fucking prions out, and infected 714 Virginians, and it said its death total was gonna be ‘this big’, and I said ‘That’s digusting!’ So, I’m making a call-out post on the State Capitol Grounds today. COVID-19, you’ve got tiny prions! They’re the size of this nitrogen molecule, except way smaller! And guess what! Here’s what our plan for the Commonwealth looks like:}” 
  A line graph popped up on the screen behind Gov. Northam. “
  
    Oh, Rodolfo.
  
  ”, bemoaned Michelle.
 
  “{
  
    Bwoom

  The Governor signed some fancy-looking documents, then proudly displayed them to the camera.
 
  “
  {How do you like that, Corona?! I issued a Stay-at-Home order, you idiot!! You all have forty-eight hours to do your fucking shopping before all schools and non-essential businesses close until June 10th, now get out of my fucking sight before I put a ban you, too.}

  The signal from the State Capitol cut out.
 
  “
  
    What the hell was that?!
  
  ”, cried Michelle. 
 
  “
  
    A Stay-at-Home order.

    We… stay at home?
  
  ” 
 
  “Well, Yeah.”, Steve muttered in a rather cubic mannerism, “I don’t think it’d be too much of a problem for you. Aside from that outing from Ian yesterday, you’ve done nothing but play The New Animal Crossing™ all day, every day!” 
 
  “
  I didn’t deserve to be called out like that, Dad.

  It seems that Michelle would not have to explain herself. Verde had finished the Sonic Colors AMV she had been watching on her Chromebook. She slammed the laptop tight.
 
  “
  Hey, Michelle! Guess what?
  ”, she blurted.
   “Yeah?”, replied Michelle. Somewhere else, Ian shouted “UH OH”, much to the confoundment of his family. 
  Verde turned to Michelle with a giant grin all over her face. Something was about to go down.

  “UH OH!”, yelled Ian, seemingly in reaction to The Governor’s profanity-laden tirade.
 
  Ian’s mother turned off the TV. The “family” had gathered in the living room to see the governor’s “Special Announcement”, but were all left disappointed.
 
  “
  
    Whaddaya mean, ‘Uh Oh’?!

  “Oh, you know.”, said Ian, refusing to explain himself.
 
  “
  Is he always like that?

    The Governor or Ian?

  “He seems pretty normal to me.” “
  
    Of course it does.

  As per usual, Lucas said nothing as he went back to his room. Eli turned to Ian, as if worried about something. “

  Hello? Earth to Ian?

  “Ah.” “
  You had to have a minute to mentally process that?

  “But… we were in there earlier? For the past few days?” “

  Teto Kasane was sitting in the kitchen fridge, eating out of a tub of margarine, as one does as the Premier UTAU. It seems that luck was not on her side today, as

     absolutely FUCKING mental.

  “

    boring, responsible task

  “
  NO.

  Teto took one look at Haku, and with enough smugness to kill a horse, said:

  A familiar, mischievous, 
  
    magenta
  
   face slapped itself against the window in Ian’s room. Kasane Teto decided it would be fit to let herself in, tearing the bug screen with a slash of her drills.
 
  “
  
    Wow. 
  
  Long-time-no-see, 
  
    Eli-chi.
  
  ”, snickered The UTAU. 
 
  “HOW DID YOU GET TO MY HOUSE.”, bellowed Ian. 
 
  “
  How many times to we have to go over it, Long Johns!? IT’S. MAGIC.
  ” 
 
  “
  Without. Fail.”, grumbled Eli, “Every time I try to indicate that I am NOT- URAGH!!
  ” Teto grabbed Eli and put her in a chokehold!
 
  “
  Welp, that’s a big oof. Time for punish!
  ” Teto pulled out her lance Drive, preparing for an attack! 
 
  “GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF HER, YA FUCKEN’ SHIT GREMLIN!!” “
  Or what?
  ”, sneered Teto.
 
   “Or… I’ll get my hands on
  
     you.
  
  ”
 
  Ian’s mother had thrown open the door to see what the commotion was. Teto laughed at the thought of that! 
 “Ohohohohohohoho! What could a pathetic human like you do to a perfect UTAU such as--” Ian grabbed Teto by the bases of her drills! (Editor’s note: do not attempt to handle the UTAU by its drills)  
  “
  EEEYAH!
  ”, screeched Teto. UTAUs must not like getting touched there...
 
  “
  
    Christ on the Cross, what is 
  
  THAT thing!?”, Ian’s mother cried out.
 
  Ian dragged her off the front door of the apartment, as Teto kicked and screeched the entire time! Even after transitioning to attack mode, Teto’s efforts were futile!
 
  
    “RAAAAAH!!”, 
  
  Ian growled, actually being useful for once in his life.
  
     “
  
  
    SKYYYYUH!!!
  
  
    ”
  
  , shrieked the UTAU, making a noise similar to when she ran out of margarine.
 
  Drills spun, claws slashed, but 
  
    nothing could stop this angry lanklet!
  

  
    Except for… 
  
  The front door!
  
     Ian slammed Teto to the ground and stomped on her back, right between the wings!
  
 
  48! 
  “
  
    OUHhh!
  
  
    ”
  
 
  Ian threw open the door, propping it open with his feet. He dragged Teto by the legs and ran outside! He swung his tormentor around once, twice, and then…!
 
  “This bitch 
  
    empty
  
  !”, Ian cried. 
  “
  YEET!
  ”
 
  Kasane Teto was sent head-over-heels down the hill the 100-Block Building was on! She crashed straight into the metal fence at the bottom!
 
  
    CLONG
  
  !
 
  “AND STAY OUT, 
  BITCH
  !!!”, Ian screamed as loudly as he could, but it came out more like a hoarse squeal. The UTAU looked like she was knocked out. “(
  
    Was it from hitting the fence, or is it from the SHEER EMBARRASSMENT of getting rekt by 
  
  me
  
    ?)
  
  ”, Ian wondered.
 
  Ian’s mother had finally caught up to him.
 
  “
  
    Seriously, Ian, who the hell is that!?”
  
  , she cried,
  
     “What’s an ootow?
  
  ” 
 
   “I dunno, probably one of the metheads from upstairs. Have you called the cops yet? That psycho might get back up soon.”
 
  “
  
    No, Ian, I couldn’t get to my damn phone because of whatever stunt you pulled!
  
  ”
 “Well, it worked, didn’t it?” “That was extremely reckless! What if that thing had a gun? What would Elizabeth think!?” 
  “Probably something about parfaits.”
 
  “
  No, she’d 
  
    actually
  
   think it was senseless overkill, but the burglar had it coming to her.
  ”, said Eli.
 
  “
  
    When did you get here?
  
  ”, said Ian’s mother, astonished. “
  Right now.
  ” 
 
  “
  
    But ain’t that weirdo one of the methies?
  
  ” “
  She broke into and entered the apartment while Ian and I were discussing something private. 
  
    That 
  
  certainly counts as burglary, and thus, the addict is also a bur--
  ” 
 
  “Wait, wait, wait, where’d that rapscallion go?”, blurted Ian. During the conversation, the collapsed UTAU had already fled from the scene.
 
  “...” “
  Блять!
  ”
 
  “...
  
    Get back inside.
  
  ”, stammered Ian’s mother, “
  
    I’ll get the police, you two try and not go near any windows.
  
  ” 
 
  “Yeah sure.”
 
  After a nice “family talk” Michelle got back to her room
  
    .
  
   She could’ve sworn someone said “Yeet!” as she went upstairs, and the voice sounded familiar, too… Maybe all of this stress was getting finally to her.
 
  “
  ...So. Getting back to 
  
    you.
  
  ”, grumbled Michelle. “{
  oh boy!}
  ”, cheered Rio. 
 
  “
  Once again, we shouldn’t kill Ian because we’re 
  
    dangerously close to finding out
  
   what exactly INA is, and what he’ll do.

  aaand that’s bad 
  
    because?

  “
  Because I trust Ian,

  Rio, unbeknownst to their parents, went outside. For 
  
    non-essential 
  
  purposes.
 
  It was sometime late in the afternoon. At this time of year, things started to warm up and fair weather would return. The sun was shining, birds were singing. Clearly, it was a nice day this afternoon, and clearly, “The Novel Coronavirus” was 
  
    not
  
   going to be the end of the world. How could there be a catastrophic pandemic when it looked like 
  
    this

  “

  The House in Loudoun
 
  Neru Akita fell out of a Door face-down to the ground with a “plap” in their house’s backyard. 
 
  The Governor’s orders had sent the state into chaos. With only forty-eight hours to do grocery shopping, people swarmed Walmarts, Costcos, and other such big box establishments like it was December 2006 and they were looking for a Wii. But this year, it seems the hottest gift was a roll of 3-ply toilet paper. To this rule, not even Magical Gay Anime Space Robots were exempt (don’t ask me what they need to do with it, because I don’t know, either), as Missus Akita had managed to snag an Ultra-Jumbo MegaFuckYou™ pack of the paper product that was almost as big as she was. The rolls similarly flumped out of the Door.
 
  “
  Eyhahahaha!”, cackled the Boukaloid, “Just wait till Haku sees

  She burst into the kitchen. “
  Haku, Holy Fuck!
  ”, Neru cried. Haku was in the kitchen chopping up vegetables and putting them into a pot at the time, and almost had a rather unfortunate mishap involving the kitchen knife.
 
  “
  ...What the hell are you doing?
  ”, sneered Neru. “
  Soup.
  ”, bluted Haku.
 
   “
  Why.
  ” “
  It’s supposed to be ‘good for your soul’”, continued Haku, “and I'm pretty sure Teto’s soul broke today.” This of course, was assuming that Teto even had a soul. “She’s been sulking in her room ever since she went out to go chase Eli around.
  ” “
  Riiight.
  ”
 
  “
  Anyways, how was Walmart~
  ”, asked Haku. “
  It was like Fortnite in there… but instead of seven year olds, it was seven
  
    ty
  
   year olds.

  Ah, yes, I see.
  ” Haku stirred the pot some more.
 
  “
  Anyways, I got the paper product.
  ” “
  There’s only one package.
  ” “
  That’s enough, right?

  “
  ...Well, I guess. Not like we were using them anyways. But Neru, you were supposed to get 
  
    toilet paper

  What? Why is that?
  ”
 
  “
  It’ll sell for the most once things go south. Trust me. It was like that in that snowstorm we had a long while back. Anyways...

  “...
  I’m off to give Teto her soup. Help yourself to some.
  ” Haku said, carrying off the bowl upstairs. “
  ...Thanks.
  ” Neru noticed the door to the garage was wide open. Seems that 
  
    someone
  
   had been in there recently. “
  Huh.
  ” The Boukaloid went in to investigate.
 
  Nearing the apex of the stairs, Haku tripped and spilled hot soup on herself.
 
  200! Haku 
  is burning!
 
  “
  
    IIIIIYAH!!
  
  ” Haku fell down the stairs feet-first. Neru simply stepped over her. To her surprise, the garage was untouched, except for one thing. The Saw had been taken off of the rack on the wall, with the three Cores and various mechanical parts strewn around it on the workbench! 
 
  However, on top of the saw’s engine was… “
  Oh. Oh no.

  Michelle was playing The NEW Animal Crossing™ in the living room with her older sister, Verde. 
 
  “
  Hasgabjdsbdhiaobsnifbos, I sure do love doing odd jobs for a depressed raccoon so I can pay off a mortgage on a virtual home!”, crooned Michelle, “Isn’t that right, Verrie?

  Verde’s character shook a tree with a cartoonishly large beehive resting from its branches.
 
  “

  “The governor.”, squarishly stated Steve, “He’s having another press release today, hopefully to re-open the economy,or whatever the Guys at Mojang were going on about…” Michelle took the Switch out of the dock and immediately resumed her glorified yard work. 
 
  “

  “From the weekly snapshot briefings, now online?”, Steve boxily bemoaned, “All throughout the development cycle of The Nether Update? The CEO of Minecraft, Miku Hatsune, made an appearance for the first few!”

  Ian was playing on his guitar in his room. He wasn’t alone, of course, as Eli was there with him. The guitar playing was unbearable for all but Ian, and he knew that very well. 
 
  “Aaand here’s a little ditty called 
  
    ‘Snow Halation

  “
  
    Why that, of all things…

  “It’s
  
     MY

  Even in July, Ian’s irritating guitaring had persisted, off-key singing included. 
 
  “𝅘𝅥𝅮
  Blue Ridge Moun-tains, Shenandoah River…!
  𝅘𝅥
  ”
 
  To make matters worse, he had somehow convinced his mother to join in the singing, on the terms that no more “anime music” would be played. This, unfortunately for Ian, meant no more “Bloody Stream”, “Crazy Noisy Bizarre Town”, and worst of all, no more “Snow Halation” (although this was somewhat of a relief to Eli). 
 
  “
  𝅘𝅥𝅮
  
    Life is old there, older than the trees…

  “

  No one asked for this. (Okay, maybe Ian did.)
 
  “

  Oh, how she wished someone would take her home!
 
  Eli thought about Akihabara. She missed it. 
 
  Eli missed her grandmother. Eli missed Arisa. But the people she missed the most…  were her fellow μ’s. Otonokizaka Girls’ High Second-year Student Honoka Kousaka’s rag-tag gang of lovable weirdos that Eli had spent the better part of her third year with, and through the power of friendship (and a few other things), ultimately won the 2nd Love Live.
 
  Tokyo wasn’t her first home, however, it was where Eli had excelled in life, going from a flunked-out ballet backup dancer to an international sensation.
 And yet, everyone she met, everyone she knew, everyone she loved were just… characters on some show. Fake. Not real.  
  Every memory, from meeting Nozomi on the first day of their first year to the trip to New York City, was just another scene in a 27 episode series. But yet… they all felt so 
  
    real.
  
 
  “
  Nozomi…
  ”, groaned Eli.
 
  
    That’s
  
   what she missed the most. Who she wanted to see again the most. She and Nozomi had plans to enroll in the same university together in the fall after they graduated.
 
  “
  
    We’ll finally be able to be together and never have Nico-cchi butting in again!
  
  ”, snickered Nozomi.
 “A life without Nico!”, said Eli, “What I’d give to have that now!” 
  The two laughed. 
 
  
    “
  
  
    Kehehe!
  
  
    ” “
  
  
    xaxaxa!
  
  
    ” 
  
 
  “
  
    And then we’d open a parfait shop together!
  
  ”
 
  “
  
    Oh, Nozomi… there’s nothing I’d rather do~.
  
  ”
 
  But instead of college or parfaits or any of that, she was taken. Taken by a demonic android 
  
    thing
  
  , and plopped next to this amateurish, hideous, crass (and rather smelly) American 
  
    pig
  
  . To the 
  
    thing
  
   and her cohorts, Eli existed as nothing more than mere bait to keep the American in line for their master scheme. She didn’t ask for this. Eli didn’t ask for any of this! All she asked for was to go back to Akihabara, even if her world never existed outside of a screen. 
 
  “
  Take me home…!!”, 
  sobbed Eli, somewhat off-key through the couch cushion,
   “Country roads…!
  ” She wanted to cry, but felt like she physically couldn’t. (probably because she didn’t have tear ducts)
 
  “See, mom, I told you she’d join eventually!”
 
  “Bloody Stream” played from nowhere, finally causing the sing-along to come to a screeching halt.
 
  “
  
    Ian, we agreed on no anime music!
  
  ”, bemoaned Ian’s mother.
 
  “Aw, nah, mom, that’s my ringtone.” “
 
  
    Well, when did you change that? I thought it was some of the… Electric Dance Music something? Whatever your generation calls it!
  
  ” 
 
  “Eh, a couple months back. I oughtta head to my room. Think this call might be from the 
  
    Publix…
  
  !”, said Ian, overly enthusiastic about the prospect of making minimum wage. 
 
  “
  
    Good look at the phone interview, buddy!
  
  ”, cheered his mother.
 
   “
  yeah…
  ”, muttered Eli.
 
  “UH Oh… Wait, no, that’s only for when Michelle says it!” He closed the door behind him.
 
  “
  
    So what’s up with you, Eli?
  
  ”, asked Ian’s mother.
 
  “
  
    What?
  
  ”, asked Eli.

   

  “
  
    You seem like you’ve been out of it…
  
  ” 
 
  “
  I’m…  just homesick, I’m sure…
  ”, murmured Eli. “
  
    I certainly feel that. Although, Harrisonburg’s a helluva lot closer to here than 
  
  Moscow! 
  
    I can’t imagine what that’s like, being stuck in another country...”
  
 
  “
  It’s hard.
  ”

   “
  
    And it’d be one thing if you could call up your folks… but you said they live in a rural area, right? Without internet or cell towers?
  
  ” 
 
  “
  That is correct.
  ” 
 
  “
  
    Ah, so just like my folks.
  
  ”
 “I’d think you could just write ‘em a letter, but I’ve heard that as a safety precaution, most countries ain’t doin’ international mail for a while… but you know what, Eli?” “ 
  What?
  ”
 “We’ll all get through this. The storm clouds will pass one day, you and Ian and everybody else will go back to school, and you’ll be able to see your family again. You two still have most of your lives in front of you!” 
  “
  Yes. Thank you.
  ”
 
  Ian knew that Publix wasn’t the one calling. The glitched number was a clear indicator. It meant it was one of 
  
    them…
  
   The Wonderful Three, he liked to call them. Neru and the others had thankfully stayed silent for the past three months, but now...? What the hell did THEY want!?

  “And what exactly am I supposed to do with this, uh… Anti-Miku Saw?” 
 
  “{
  WHAT IT SAYS ON THE TIN, DUMBASS.}
  ”, Neru snapped back. 
 
  “Eliminate… the Miku?” 
 
  Neru resumed her saccharine facade. “{
  
    Oh, no!
  
   I never intended for ‘
  
    elimination’…!
  
   T.A.M.S. is specifically designed to make the core extraction process so easy that even

   could do it!... which is why I made it…!}

  “...”
 
  “{
  It'll go right through Miku like a hot knife through butter!}

  “{Hello? 
  Did I drop you or something?}
  ”
 
  “...no…” 
 
  “{
  If you’re too much of a coward to do this, then-_
  ”
 
  “...I’ll, do it.”, muttered Ian, with a moment of hesitation.
 
  “{
  There we go! That’s what I like to hear. 
  
    You know the drill by now, Gate should be up soon, 
  
  and in case you’ve

  ”
 “Is it a security thing, or…?” “I can’t stand that damn tankie!” Neru paused for a moment. 
  “...Did 
  
    you 
  
  get disconnected…?”
 
   “{
  No, No… just got this… creepy feeling.}
  ”
 
  “...Like?” “{
  Someone’s watching me.}
  ” 
 
  “Okay.” Ian was far too used to the song and dance by now.
 
  “{
  Moving on, I let Eli into the house 
  
    one time

    ranting

  “Well. It was

    second time
  
  … Eh? Usually you’d interject by now.” 
 
  “{
  The feeling’s gotten worse, Ian.}”, said Neru, morosely, “{It’s getting closer.}
  ” “What?”
 
  “{
  Just… hurry up, and get over here!}
  ” 
 
  “okay…?” Neru hung up on Ian.

  
  

  “Damt.” Ian opened the door. He still had to get past his family, and get past Eli, to pick up this confused “T.A.M.S.” thing.
 
  “
  
    Oh, Ian, buddy, how was the interview?
  
  ”, asked Ian’s mother. 
 
  “I… Have to go.”
 
  “

  “Oh, didja want anything?” Lucas piped up, for once.

  “

  “Cool. See y’all in a bit.”

    own
  
  .”
 
  “
  
    Alright, buddy, seeya in a bit!
  
  ” Ian grabbed the car keys and left. (even though he wasn’t going to use them.) 
 
  “
  ...He’s not going to Publix.
  ”, groaned Eli.
 
  “
  
    Eli, Why’d he be doin’ that? What’re you even implyin’
  
  ?” “
  It’s a long story…

   “
  
    Can you tell me?

  You wouldn’t believe me anyways.

 “...Well, alright.” 
  “
  No one would.”

  
  

  “
  Rurgh… why do I even bother with that guy...

  Neru put the phone on the table. It was later in the day now, and sunlight was coming in at an angle. The living room was draped in long shadows from the patio furniture outside.
 
  A strange, nasally voice came from behind Neru.
   RIGHT behind Neru.

  “
  Ey, Nerucchi? Would you terribly mind 
  
    repeating
  
   what you said about Eli-cchi?
  ”
 “EYAH!”, cried Neru. Some girl, looking to be about seventeen or eighteen or so, had just… appeared. She was wearing a khaki vest with a green bowtie over a white shirt and a blue plaid skirt. With purple twintails, piercing green eyes, and creepy little smile, this could be none other than... 
  “
  No!… NO!
  ” “
  You got the first syllable, Neru! Come on, you can say it!
  ” 
 A twisted grin had spread over the stranger’s face. Her presence alone was menacing. The moody lighting of the evening certainly did not help. “I believe in you! Kuuhuuhuu…!” 
  “
  NOZOMI TOJO!!
  ”, shrieked Neru. “
  That’s right!~♡
  ” Nozomi pressed uncomfortably close to Neru. Talk about breaching COVID protocol!
 
  “
  But enough about 
  
    me
  
  …”, sneered Nozomi, “I wanna make sure I understood what 
  
    you
  
   said about Eli-cchi.
  ” 
 
  “
  Ehehe…
  ”
 
  “
  
    So is Eli-cchi… 
  
  nothing more than a ‘damn tankie’ to you? Mmm?~
  ”
“Well…” “Awh.~ Adding onto that, I take it that she has nothing more to offer than ‘Gopnik Crap’?”  
  “
  Tha-That’s not what I said…
  ” Nozomi did a little pout.
 
  “
  Oh, but 
  
    Nerucchi
  
  , that is 
  
    exactly
  
   what you said!~
  ” Neru took out her Drive. She brandished the zweihander!
 
  “
  That’s enough outta you,

   Nozomi disappeared! Neru crashed into the wall, and she felt something grab her from behind! Neru couldn’t move!
 
  “
  Tell me, 
  
    Nerucchi
  
  . Do you know what happens to those who tell
  
     dirty lies

  Neru barely managed to squeak out a “
  N-n-n-n-o…
  ” She hadn’t felt this much fear since 
  
    the incident
  
   all those years ago!
 
  Nozomi grabbed Neru by the chest!!

  ”
 
  The world went silent… “
  ...uwa?

  Lavender sparks flew about the room, and the last thing Neru heard was a whisper.
 
  Nozomi squeezed 
  
    good and hard
  
   on Neru’s Neru’s!

   got hurt and collapsed...

  Loudoun County
 
  There was little problem for Ian getting through the Gate. And yet, at the house… something seemed off… Haku’s car wasn’t in the driveway, either. Hadn’t she “borrowed it back without warning” a while ago, during the quarantine?

  For once, the Sun was 
  
    behind
  
   Neru’s house. It did make everything in the yard look dark. Was that why the vibes were weird? No, that couldn’t be it. Ian walked up to the door and knocked. No response, although that was typical of them. The door had been left. unlocked.
 
  “Guess I’m just supposed to let myself in…”, muttered Ian. And so he did just that. 
 
  The living room looked off too. Again, was it because of the soon-to-be-setting Sun? No. 
  
    Normal
  
   shadows wouldn’t do that. Strangely, none of the “Wonderful Three” were to be found here either. Ian clearly remembered that the 
  
    last time
  
   he was over, Neru was in the living room. After that,… well, he didn’t remember much, but that didn’t matter right now.
 
  Ian snooped around the first floor a bit. No signs of Magical Gay Anime Space Robots in the kitchen (Someone had even left their dinner going, as a large pot of chicken soup was still on the stove), pantry, dining room, that empty room they never brought up (Ian presumed that this was a guest room at one point), the garage… 
 
  “Wait… hold on…” The door to the basement was wide open. The vibes seemed to be more “off” in that direction. 
 
  “Yes. Let’s go into the basement! Spectacular Idea!”, Ian thought to himself. With that, Ian climbed down the basement stairs.
 
  “Oh boy, I can’t wait to see all the dead bodies Neru no doubt has down here!” After fumbling a bit Ian flicked on the light. Unfortunately, what he saw was 
  
    worse
  
   than a murder victim.
 
  Neru Akita and Teto Kasane were both unconscious, strung up on shelves in the rear end of the basement. Some kind of… doggy crate meant for very large breeds was there as well, seemingly burst open. The crate had a piece of paper taped to it. The paper said “Gay Baby Jail” on it, in Teto’s handwriting! “(Gay Baby Jail…? 
  
    Simpleflips?
  
   Oh, no…)”
 
  Ian walked over to the crate to take a closer look. There were some candy wrappers in the crate, too. What was most concerning, however, was an octagonal, verdant green, gem no bigger than a half-dollar. It seemed to be glowing in the dim light of the basement.
 
  As he got closer to the crate, Ian inspected the candy wrappers.

  “(
  
    What is that
  
  … a Snickers? And a Twix? Looks like it’s recent.)”
 
  Ian reached into the crate, and felt a menacing presence watching him. He pulled out and whipped around, expecting to be face-to-face with some monster (but more-than-likely just an ornery and intoxicated Haku), but only saw the same, empty stairway he came down. His attention turned to the unconscious and bound Boukaloids.

  
  

  Neither of them had any sort of scars on their torso that would indicate Core removal, and the lack of multicolored stains on the ground suggested this wasn’t the case. Was there another way to take these things out? The question also still remained: Where was Haku, if not down here? 
 
  “Boy,” said Ian, ”‘it sure is a wacky and uncharacteristic plot twist that the bodies in Neru’s basement were actually her and Teto the entire time… Anyways, time to go home!” Ian flicked the lights to the basement off as he got onto the stairs. 
  
    HOWEVER...

  A rather nasally growl came from behind him.
 
  “
  I don’t think you’re going to be doing any of 
  
    that
  
  , tubby boy…!
  ”
 
  Ian turned around to meet a pair of eyes the same color as the gem staring back at him from within the darkness. He flicked the lights back on.
 
  “Wow! It’s Nozomi!”, exclaimed Ian, overly excited for his imminent doom “What’s she doing here!?” Nozomi Tojo approached Ian.
 
  “
  Teto tells me YOU’RE the one that’s been tormenting Eli-cchi.
  ”
 “Uh...” “At a loss for words? Hmh, you clearly aren’t the wisest of sorts… But that doesn’t matter! Bullies like you oughtta be swiftly disposed of!” 
  Nozomi took up a strange stance, her hands splayed, head and arms craned forwards. Ian recognized it, from somewhere long ago.
 
  “
  
    Wait! That’s from School Idol Project, Season 1, Episode 7, “Elichika”, about halfway through the episode! Right before she ‘attacked’ Nico…
  
 
  
    Oh, no.”
  
   
 
  “
  ...Any last words?
  ”, cackled the eighth muse.
 
   “...” “
  ...?
  ”
 
  “NIGERUNDAYOOOOOO!!!”
  , 
  screeched Ian as he clambered up the remainder of the basement stairs.
 
  Nozomi was at a loss at the sheer audacity of this lad.
 
  “
  The Tarot has failed me. But it matters not, for this fuckboy’s fleeing shall be fruitless!
  ”
 
  Ian stood at the top of the stairs, staring down into the darkness as long shadows. Nozomi was bound to give chase eventually. He’d knock the marauding school idol down, and make a run for it to the Gate!
 
  But unfortunately for him, that wouldn’t be happening. The shadows weren’t the only things reaching for Ian, as he quickly felt something grabbing at his chest from behind!
 
  “
  My, My,”, said Nozomi, “I haven’t seen breasts this big on a man before…~ They’re even bigger than Nicocchi’s!
  ”
 
  “DID YA JUST CALL ME 
  FAT
  !?”
 
  “
  Hmm? What then, tubby? The Washi Washi has no weakness…
  ”
 
  “I’m… gonna. probably cry.” 
 
  All noise seemed to dampen, and lavender sparks flew about!
 
  He hastily backed into the kitchen, Nozomi no doubt attached to his back. 
 
  “nyeeuurh”, was the sound that Ian made. 
 
  “
  Washi washi suru yan!
  ” He felt… nothing despite Nozomi’s best efforts. As quickly as the sparks had formed, they had fizzled out.
 
  No effect!
 
  “
  Nani!?
  ”, cried Nozomi.
 
  “Hmph. You call 
  
    that
  
   a Washi Washi? Do you have the big dumb dumb!?” 
 
  “
  
    No…!
  
  ” 
 
  “No ‘buts’, bitch, I already know the answer is a cold, hard 
  
    YES
  
  . 
  HARDER!
  ” 
 
  “
  NANI THE
  
     FUCK
  
  !?
  ” Nozomi finally let go and dropped the floor
 
  “DID I FUCKIN’ STUTTER, BOOBS MCKENZIE!? 
  HARDER!!!
  ”, Ian growled.
 
  “
  This! This is impossible! 
  
    The Washi Washi has no weakness!
  
  ” 
 
  “The only 
  
    weak thing
  
   here is those hands of yers! Yew ain’t goin’ at it hard enough!!”, boasted Ian, “If you’re normally like this, it’s a really wonder ‘Parfait Time’ ever managed to work out between the two of ya!” 
 
  “
  
    Now you’ve done it!
  
  ”, howled Nozomi.
 
   “Go on then, just 
  
    try
  
   to grab me like that again!”
 
  “
  Maybe I 
  
    will
  
  !
  ” Nozomi latched on to Ian! The world went quiet again, but Ian had a trick up his sleeve!
 
  “
  
    SPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN!!
  
  ”  “
  Ayiii!
  ”
 
  Ian spun in a circle in the middle of the kitchen, taking Nozomi for a wild ride with him! It wouldn’t last long…
 
  “
  Enough of this 
  
    INSOLENCE!!
  
  ” The weight on Ian’s back was lifted, and yet, Nozomi was nowhere to be found. She had vanished into thin air! Ian still felt like he was being watched, but the kitchen was empty aside from the still-boiling pot and long, dready shadows cast by the setting sun…
 
  “
  
    Nozomi’s in the soup, isn’t she?! 
  
  No… That’s stupid. But then again, my best friend is from space, 
  
    and she never bothered to tell me for years
  
  , so I guess anythin’s possible now…”

  
  

  Haku parked the car. Another , anodayther trip to the VABC store to stock up for the rest of the night. She grabbed a couple bags and headed for the door.
 
  “(
  ...why is it unlocked? I swore I locked it before leaving this time...)
  ”
 
  “Oi, 
  Neru!”, cried Haku, “I got the good stuff…!
  ” But there was no sign of Neru. Haku tried looking in the kitchen.
 
  “
  Oi, Neru…” Unfortunately, Haku did not find her fellow derivative, but rather, one oversized bag of lipids.  “Ian? FUCKER, that’s 
  
    my
  
   soup! Get away from it you oaf, it’s still cooking!
  ” 
 
  “Ya left soup cookin’… while you went out?”, muttered Ian.
 
  “
  well yeah.
  ” “It’d be one thing if it was a crockpot, but this… Oh, that’s not important, what 
  
    is
  
   important is that Nozomi got out and I’m pretty sure Neru is dead now.”
 
  “
  she WHAT.
  ”, shouted Haku.
 
  “Neru is dead now, who would’ve thought that the bodies in her basement were herself all along? What a plot twist!”
 
  “
  No. Nozomi.
  
     She got out of her crate?
  
  ”
 
  “Why the fuck are you keeping a school idol in a doggy crate?”, retorted Ian. 
 
  “
  That was Teto’s idea!
  ”, bemoaned Haku. Ian saw something moving.

  “
  Wait here. I have to get something. If Nozomi’s hiding, she’s probably in the shadows.
  ”
 
  “The shadows?” The moving feeling grew closer. On a whim, Ian pulled out his phone, turned on the flashlight, and waved it around. There was a kind of… dark blob on the edge of the kitchen floor, right where the wood ended and the carpet began. Ian pointed the flashlight to it!
 
  The blob quivered and disintegrated! 
 
  1,500!
 
  Nozomi popped out of the floor where the blob just was!
 
  “ENEMY SCHOOL IDOL INBOUND!!”, shouted Ian.
 
  “
  Kuuhuuhuuhuu~...”, snickered Nozomi, “You’re awfully persistent
  . 
  But 
  
    that’s not all I’ve got@
  
  ”
 
  “What? Ya gonna tarot reading on me? ‘Your daily forecast calls for a high of   『Hierophant Green』with a low of 『Hermit Purple』. Expect a 98% chance of 『ZA WARUDO』’?”, quipped Ian, shouting all of the stand names.
 
  “
  Not everything is a JoJo reference, you wretched weeaboo!
  ”,seethed Nozomi.
 
   “It is though, D4C! Infinite Multiverse Theory makes 
  
    everything
  
   a JoJo reference!!” “
  Damn you!
  ”
 
   A purple scythe with a silver chine sprouted forth from behind Nozomi’s arm. This must be her magic weapon doohickey! “
  DAMN YOU AND YOUR LOOPHOLES!!
  ” 
 
  Nozomi charged forward, rearing for a strike with the scythe. She was barely 4 feet away, 
  
    totally not socially distancing!!
  
   Ian had an idea at the last moment. He grabbed the pot of chicken soup!
 
  “
  Yeet!
  ”, cried Ian, as he chucked Haku’s creation at the rampaging idol.
 
  500! 
 
  Nozomi is burnt!
 
  500!
 
  Nozomi took damage from her burn!
 
  
    “
  
  
    REEEYYAAAA!
  
  ”, hissed Nozomi. 
 
  “And now…!” Ian slammed the empty pot on Nozomi’s head! She fell to the floor! A soup-covered, burnt, forcefully pot-wearing Nozomi looked up.
 “Kah! What... did I do…”, she sais wearily, “to warrant this? This utter disgracefulness?” Ian sat down on the floor next to her, in complete disregard for his own safety. 
  “I mean… ya 
  
    did
  
   molest Nico Yazawa three times in one day;”, stated Ian with great nonchalance, “the first time right in front of her friends, and then in a Burger King, and then, on the rooftop. That last one apparently had Rin and Honoka thrown in there as well.”
 
  “
  Kuuuh…? Did Elicchi tell you all of that…?
  ”
 
   “Nah, it was in the show.” 
 
  “
  ...the what.
  ” “The show. ‘
  
    Love!Live!: School Idol Project
  
  ’, exclamation marks included.
 
  “
  A show?!
  ” “Hyep.”
 
  “(
  For fuck’s sake, where is it!?)
  ”
 
  Haku knew she wasn’t supposed to be snooping around in Neru’s room. However, that’s where all of the Modules the three had less-than-100%-legally acquired over the years, in a large, yellowish, treasure chest. The chest stood out from the rest of Neru’s rather dreary room. Somehow, the irony was lost on Neru that she had a box full of collectibles of her friend turned enemy sitting in her room.
 
  “(
  
    C’mon, C’mon…)
  
  ”, Haku strained as she rifled around for her Module.
 
  For whatever reason, one of the Module cards had a picture of Nozomi on it. Where did Neru even get 
  
    that
  
  ? It didn’t matter right now.
 
  Haku had finally found what she was looking for. She pulled out a card labelled “Gothic Purple”.
 “(Seriously! Why did they only make one Mod for me?)” Haku stuck Gothic Purple into the slot on her left arm. 
  An ornate, violet dress and long black gloves appeared on her, with a complimentary indigo bow and tiny black hat to boot!

  “
  Showtime.
  ” She pulled out her Drive. The modern-looking handgun was replaced by a similarly ornate flintlock pistol! Somehow, this made the gun stronger.
 
  “(
  Is this gonna be enough…?)
  ” The sound of someone shouting “
  
    Damn You!!”
  
   coming from downstairs told Haku that the answer to that was a big fat “No”. Haku would have to break out 
  
    the big gun
  
   for this. If Nozomi ever got out into the world, she’d Washi Washi the entire state! No, the 
  
    COUNTRY!
  
 
  “(
  It’s been years since that thing was even touched… Wonder if we’ve even got bullets left for that thing? It’s worth a shot, at least.)
  ” 
 
  Haku thought that the old gun would be kept in the closet in Neru’s room.  A cursory search proved that thought to be true. Neru really just had this priceless weapon stashed in between some unmarked storage bins.
 
  “(
  Okay then… Looks like it’s still got one bullet in it… Are there any more nearby, perhaps?)
  ” A terrible screech coming from the kitchen told Haku to hurry up.
 
  “(
  Fuck it! We got one shot in this bad boy, better make it count.)
  ”
 
  “(
  The stuff Teto puts inside these nesoberis is similar to the stuff inside of us, right? Hopefully, this will work.)
  ” 
 
  “
  It’s
  
     gotta
  
   work.

  Haku rushed down the stairs with the old Poison Rifle!

  The pot was still on Nozomi’s head. Was she 
  
    intentionally 
  
  leaving it on? Ian decided it was best not to get close enough to take it off. Whatever the reason, the soup seemed to have somehow calmed Nozomi down. Or perhaps, the overwhelming existential dread of finding out one doesn’t exist caused her to emotionally shut down and forget to attack. Who is to say!
 
  “
  ...So this ‘Sunshine’ group took all of the PVs Rin and I had made and combined them into a 27-part series?
  ”, asked Nozomi meekly. “Oh, yeah,” blathered Ian, the weight of the situation lost on him, “the content’s all the same. Everything from Honoka’s first day as a second-year to the ‘‘’’‘
  
    Last Live
  
  ’’’’’ in 2013.” 
 
  “
  Why are you saying ‘Last Live’ with air quotes? We broke up as a group after that concert!
  ”
 
  “I dunno, maybe just where you came from, ‘cause ‘A Song for You. You? You!’ sure is a thing that exists!” 
 “Come again?”

  Haku clambered down the stairs, waving some kind of spacey-looking gun around!
 
  “
  Get away from that thing!
  ”, she cried. 
 
  “Why?”, asked Ian, “Shouldn’t we-”
 
  PSCHWR!! 
 
  Some kind of laser-bullet bore through the pot… And Nozomi, as well!
 
  7,500! 
  
    Nozomi is poisoned! 
  
 
  What seemed to be a mixture of lavender gel and polyester stuffing flew out of the second hole in the pot!
 
  500! 300!
 
  Nozomi took damage from her burn! Nozomi took damage from the poison!
 
  The pot clattered to the ground!
 
  “Aw dang, She’s disappeared again, hasn’t she…?”
 
  “
  Fucker, that thing was expensive! Start searching again!
  ” Ian waved around the flashlight onto the various shadows in the kitchen, but it seems that Nozomi had found 
  
    them
  
   first.
 
  Haku felt something grab at her chest!

  ”, scoffed Nozomi. 
 
  Nozomi had a giant hole in the side of her head! The parts that were exposed showed some kind of purple gel inside of her, but around the wound, it was stained a deep black! 
 
  “
  ...You bastard!!
  ”, growled Haku.
 
  “(Oh, shit, I don’t know what to do!)”, thought Ian.
 
  “
  Oh?”, mused Nozomi, “I’m the bastard? But Haku, I’m not the one keeping 
  
    people
  
   in dog cages, AM I?
  ” There was a certain aura of rage to Nozomi’s words.
 
  “
  Again! That was Teto’s idea!
  ” 
 
  “
  And yet, Haku, you did 
  
    nothing
  
   to stop it. Just like, back on your homeworld, you had done nothing to stop Teto and 
  
    Nerucchi
  
   from recruiting you and commissioning you to-
  ”
 
  “
  URUSAI!!
  ” 
  Haku took out the flintlock and started blasting.
 
  531!

  532!

  528! 300!
 
  Nozomi got hurt by the poison!
 
  “
  
    Aooouuuahhhh!!~
  
  ”, she whelped.
 
  Nozomi got hurt and collapsed…
 
  With her head practically ripped open, and her body covered in her own “blood”, Nozomi finally stopped moving. She turned back to a plush, which Haku kicked aside.
 
  “...Haku? What the 
  
    HELL
  
   did she mean by ‘back on your homeworld’?”, asked Ian, “What happened between the three of y’alls?”
 
  “
  Nothing…
  ” “If it really was nothin’, why’d ya react like that?”
 
  “
  You’re here to pick up the saw, right…? It’s in the garage. Go get it.”, said Haku sternly. 
 
  “A-alright…”
 “Neru will contact you again soon with further instruction. Now go.” 
  “Rather pushy, aren’t you?”
 
  “
  Just get the fucking saw.
  ”
 
  “Alright, alright, fine…”

  
  

  “Yep. This is the garage.”
 
  To Ian, it felt like it had been months since he was last here. There were times in between the run-in with Luka and today where he had been to Neru’s house. He and Neru had been purportedly designing this T.A.M.S. thing.
 
  “So then, why can’t I remember any of it…?”
 
  The first thing Ian noticed in the grace was this rather bulky orange chainsaw. The casing around the engine was jarringly orange plastic, like hunting gear, while the rear handle and front guard seemed to be made out of some high-grade metal. This metal also covered the front handle, as well as the guide bar. What was it? Titanium? 
  
    Scandium?
  
   Where would Neru have gotten 
  
    that
  
  ? 
 
  Strangely, on this thing, there was no sign of a gas cap. Was it even gas powered? Ian peered inside a gap in the cover, to try and find an engine of any sorts.
 
  “Ah.” Three glowing gems were arranged in a triangular shape in some sort of strange addition. One red gem, one blue gem, and one pink gem. 
 
  “The Cores.” This core-engine almost reminded Ian of the Flux Capacitor. Almost.
 
  Upon further inspection, the saw lacked a pull handle as well, there was some kind of button on the side, presumably to start it. The rear handle had a button as well, likely the trigger, and yet, there was no safety on the saw.
 
  “...Weird. Might as well take the damn thing and go home.”
 
  And so, unceremoniously putting the saw in an empty Rubbermaid bin, he did.
 
  Ian closed the garage door behind him. He took a look around outside before going through the Gate back home.
 
  The sun had set by now. The sky was a dull indigo color, and yet, the clouds glowed orange off of reflected sunlight.
 
  Ian held The Anti-Miku Saw. He stared down the guide bar nervously, gruesomely envisioning what was supposed to be on the other end of the weapon.

  “But… Am I really going to do this to Michelle…? Er, Miku? My best friend of three years, on the business end of this souped-up branch cutter?”
 
  “I’m going to do… 
  
    that
  
  ”, he said, pantomiming a stabbing motion, “to Miku…?”

  “
  Seriously, why are you even in German?
  ”, asked Katie.
 
  “
  ‘Cuz I need the Language Credit for IB.
  ”, said Michelle rather pensively.
 
  The table thus said “
  
    IB
  
  ” together pensively, almost pronouncing the pensive emoji. Rio walked upto the table with a tray and sat down.
 
  “
  ey guise what’d I miss?
  ”, they asked.
 
   “
  Me complaining about Frau.

  “
  but that’s the best part. how could I miss that for 
  
    school lunch

  “
  Why’d you even get that stuff?”, asked Jake. “That pizza looks like it’s made of plastic.
  ”
 
  “
  because I hate myself
  ”, Rio blurted without hesitation. “
  That is true.

  “
  Going off earlier,” said Katie, “why haven’t you tried to transfer

  “Hey,”, said Ian, recognising one of the members, “it’s Jake, from STEM Club!” 
 
  “
  Hey! It’s Ian,”, replied Jake snarkily, “who does absolutely nothing in our meetings!

  “Ah, SOL Testin’s a reaaaal bitch, ain’t it?”, quipped Ian. “

  “

  Rio tore open the carton of strawberry “milk” and started chugging.
 
  “Well where’s ‘Rio’?” “
  Behind me.

  “Oh. So that’s a Rio.”, Ian turned to Michelle, “Say, isn’t she who yo-” 
 
  Rio spat out the strawberry milk.

  “

  “you were sayin’-... tah..” The three across the table slowly turned to stare at Ian, with some kind of dismal demeanor, almost synchronously. Rio still had strawberry milk dripping out of their mouth, but they were staring, too. 
 
  “what the fuck… You, uh, you ok, R-rio?” “
  Don’t call me that.

  “What? ‘Rio’? Don’t call ya ‘Rio’?” “
  No, ‘She’.

   is a ‘Non-Binary’ supposed to mean?”
 
  “
  It means you call Rio ‘they/them’.

  “...*.a.”
 
  “
  ...Ian?

   “..#..*..e...” 
 
  “

  “..#.o...!.” 
 
  “

  “....^..uuuuuuuu Okay, got it.”, stated Ian. “

   “
  Awh.

  “
  Moving on then…

 “Rio,”, bemoaned Jake, “you’re not seriously gonna eat that pizza, are you?” 
  “

  You spat on it. It has milk and… saliva all over it.

  “
  don’t worry, it’s sauce!

  “Rio, you’re not even eatin’ it the right way!”, blabbed Ian. “
  
    why’re you telling me what to do

  “
  
    LITERALLY WHO
  
   eats pizza with the crust-end first? What are you, from 
  
    another planet

  “
  Maybe I am, Ian.”, Rio derided, “Maybe I 
  
    am
  
   from another planet.
  ” Rio gestured at the other three on the opposite side of the table. “
  Maybe 
  
    all of us

  Michelle laughed somewhat uncomfortably. 
 
  “
  Ehehehe…
  ” The others joined in. They weren’t nearly as uncomfortable, however, especially Rio!
 
  “

July 15th, 2020 -- The Day Before Miku’s Birthday. 

  7:30 P.M.
 
  The Quarantine, although now phasing out at this point, had done its toll on Ian and his “family”. Every day, Ian, his mother, his brother, and a reluctant Eli had been doing various activities to keep up morale, but they all knew it was ultimately for naught. Eli seemed to be hit the hardest, and Ian wondered why she always had seemed so… out of it since her “arrival”. 
 
  After the events earlier this week, Ian 
  
    knew 
  
  what was wrong with Eli. It was Nozomi, or rather, 
  
    the lack thereof.
  
   The two clearly missed each other, but there was nothing Ian could do! (Or was there?) Speaking of, where was Eli now? 
 
  Sitting on the couch, helping herself to Ian’s mother’s Netflix account. Of course. Said mother was off running errands, Lucas in tow, because “
  
    he needed to go outside for once in his gosh-darned life”
  
  , leaving the apartment to the two “lovebirds”.
 
  Ian knew t
  
    hey
  
   weren’t actually boyfriend and girlfriend. Never have, never would be. The two idols were practically meant to be together.
 
  “
  What’s gotten into you?
  ”, asked Eli, noticing Ian’s concern.
 
  “I-i dunno…”, muttered Ian. 
 
  “
  You never know, do you?
  ”
 
  “What, did you actually expect me to know things?” “
  Yes.
  ”
 
  “Welp. I don’t.”
 
  A rather awkward pause ensued, interrupted by Ian’s phone pinging. He checked his phone like the simp that he is.
 
  “(An Email…? Who’s this from?)”
 
  “
  What’s that?
  ” “I just said I don’t know things, how would I know what this is, either?”
 
  “
  ...Fair enough.
  ”
 
  Ian opened up the email. It was from … Mrs. COOL IT!!!?

    Ian, 
  
 
  
    It’s come to my attention that for whatever reason, Michelle hasn’t included you on the invitation list to her birthday party tomorrow. You’re her best friend of three years now, what reasons would she have to leave you out@? It’s strange, to say the least, and my husband and I’s attempts to get any sort of meaningful information as to why haven’t worked. Michelle’s been acting strange since the lockdown began, too. I’d chalk it up to be nothing more than the cabin fever we’ve all been getting, but something about her seems off, you know?
  
 
  
    You know her well enough. I’m sure if you two were to meet up again, you’d be able to help her get through whatever is causing her to be this way. Thereby, Ian, you are invited to Michelle’s 17th Birthday Party, tomorrow, at 3 PM! You have my permission as her mother to attend! I know on such a short notice, you probably won’t be able to buy a gift. No worries! Your presence is enough of a gift! I hope to see you tomorrow!
  
 
  
    --Stacy COOL IT!!!
  
 
  “(Oh… shit.)” That was tomorrow. The day. The day where Ian was supposed to do the thing with the chainsaw. 
  
    That day
  
  .
 
  ...At the very least, Ian had already bought a gift for Miku-chelle! He wasn’t sure how he was gonna be able to give it to her, considering the whole assassination thing, but it’s the thought that counts! As for what it was, It was the 
  
    ONE
  
   thing Miku-chelle had been talking about. For MONTHS. YEARS, even.
 
  “(
  
    Xenoblade Chronicles! 
  
  On the Switch… NOT 2, but Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition!)”
 
  The Switch game was EXACTLY what Michelle wanted.
 
  “
  Ian, why are you staring off into space like that?”, asked Eli, “Are you thinking about Snow Inhalation again?
  ”
 
  “...”
 
  “
  Ian…?
  ” “...hwut”
 
  “
  Why do I even bother with you… 
  ” “Watanabe?” “
  No.
  ” 
 
  “
  Something’s been up with you since Friday, since you came back from Neru’s house.
  ” 
 
  “...how did you know I went there?” 
 
  “
  Unlike you, 
  
    not
  
   Watanabe, I’m not stupid! You get this irritated look on your face whenever she makes you work on your ‘project’ together. Friday night, for the first time you 
  
    returned 
  
  from her house with the same look, as well as a Rubbermaid Bin that you’ve refused to disclose the contents of.
  ”
 
  “Oh… that…”, said Ian morosely.
 
  “
  What’s even 
  
    in
  
   the bin? Is it your special ‘project’?
  ”
 
  “Well, uh…”
 
  “
  Hmm?
  ” Thankfully, Ian’s phone went off again, relieving this tension.
 
  
    “{Hey buddy!}
  
  ” It was Ian’s mother!
 
  “Hi, Mom!” “
  ...
  ”
 
  “{
  
    So, I know you two have been stuck at home all day while me and the Peanut ran errands all day…}
  
  ”
 
  “That is true” 
 
  “{
  
    And while we’re over on this part of town… I was thinkin’… I’d pick up some late dinner at Cookout! (Provided you haven’t eaten already…)}
  
  ”
 
  “YES PALEASE!” 
 
   “
  Alright,” said Eli, “but what’s so good about 
  
    that
  
  ?
  ”
 
  “The Cookout Tray is objectively the best fast-food combo.”, stated Ian.
 
  “
  (Maki was right… Americans really 
  
    don’t
  
   think about anything besides fast food…)
  ”
 
  “{
  
    So, whaddaya say, buddy
  
  ?}”
 
   It was as if Ian had been waiting for this moment his entire life.
 
  “Cajun chicken sandwich with a double order of cheese bites and a caramel cheesecake shake!”, he said giddily
 
  “
  By God…”, muttered Eli, “you get a 
  
    milkshake
  
  ?
  ”
 
  “{
  
    I’ll take that as a yes for you, but does Eli want anything?}
  
  ” Ian put the phone on speaker.
 
  “Could you ask that again, It’s on speaker now…”
 
  “{
  
    Eli, didja want anything from Cookout
  
  ?}” 
 
  “
  The Tray?
  ” “{
  
    With…?
  
  }
  
    ”
  
 
  “
  The Burger.
  ” “{
  
    Big Double?
  
  }” “
  Uh, sure.
  ”
 
  “{
  
    And sides?
  
  }” “
  Large fries.
  ” 
 
  “{
  
    A double order, you mean?
  
  }” “
  Yes.
  ”
 
  “{
  
    You wanna shake, too?
  
  }
  
    ” 
  
  “
  (You know what? Umi isn’t here. FUCK IT!) Yes! Chocolate, please!
  ”
 
  “{
  
    Alright! I’ll go pick up the food and be back in jiffy! Y’all sit tight there!
  
  }
  
    ”
  
 
  “Thanks, Mom!” “
  Thanks.
  ”
 
  “{
  
    Love you!
  
  }” “Love you too!”, said Ian saccharinely. 
 
   Ian hung up.
 
  “
  That’s cool and all, but none of that answers what’s up with you 
  ”
 
  “I still dunno.” “
  You haven’t figured it out?!
  ” 
 
  “It’s been like, three minutes since you last asked, Eli. That’s not enough time! Besides, I’ve got this terrible feeling...”
 
  “
  About what, your little ‘project’?
  ”
 
  “No… That 
  this is going to be a terrible night…
  ”

  
  
  

  “
  
    Aaand that’s everything. Thank 
  
  you
  
     for stopping by Cookout today, ma’am!
  
  ” 
 
  Ian’s mother chuckled. “
  
    Hahaha, we’re regulars! It’s our favorite!
  
  ”
 
  The Drive-Thru attendant laughed as well, although rather dryly. Like most retail and foodservice workers, he was completely dead on the inside.
 
  “
  
    Ahaha! You have a CookTacular™ Evening, madam!” “You as well!”
  
   
 
  Ian’s mother pulled around the restaurant after taking the food, the two shakes,.
 
  “
  
    Lucas, buddy, could you put this into the backseat so it doesn’t fall over?”
  
 
  
    “
  
  
    No.
  
  
    ” 
  
  He didn’t even look up from his Switch. Fortnite was apparently 
  
    that 
  
  important.
 
  
    “Well you’re no help….”
  
 
  She put the four boxes of food onto the passenger seat and hoped for the best, driving off down the turnpike.

  
  

  Outside, it felt like it was about to start pouring rain.

  Eli had served her purpose.  It was time for her to go, whether she liked it or not.
 
  Once again, Ian and Eli were in Ian’s room. For whatever reason, Ian felt compelled to play the guitar again. They were blissfully unaware of the events transpiring.

  ”, announced Teto with a smirk.
 
  “No, I don’t,”, replied Ian, “that’s why I’m askin’ you!”
 
  “
  Well, y’see kiddo,” Teto patted Eli on the back, “This little toy of yours here is defective… and I gotta take it back to the toy store… yeah…
  ”
 
  “Defective?”, inquired Ian.
   
 
  “That’s what I just said.”
 
  “OH.”

  Ian shot up out of the chair.
 
  “
  
    OH HO HO, MISSUS KASSA-NAY. 
  
  Ya really think you can do that? Keep Eli’s 
  
    secret 
  
  away from me forever?!”
 
  “
  My secret?”, blubbered Eli, “What the 
  
    fuck
  
   is this?” She turned to the UTAUloid.“Teto, hurry up and kill me already!
  ”
 
  “
  Nah.”
 
  “Do tell, Ian, what 
  
    is 
  
  this ‘secret’?
  ”, Teto said sarcastically, making air quotes. Ian seemed giddy, as if he had been waiting for this moment for months.
 “The secret is… THAT THIS ONE, MISSUS EL-EE-CEEKA AH--YAH--SAY HAS THE BIG GAY!”, he blared. 
  “
  The what?
  ”, asked Teto, “
  I don’t think the people in the back heard you.
  ” 
 “THE BIG GAY!”, he blared once more, “and she’s GAY for Nozomi!!” Eli began to cry. 
  “
  Wow.”, scoffed Teto, “
  
    I’m so surprised. Can’t you tell, by how surprised I am.
  
  ”
 
  “...no.”, replied Ian deadpannedly. 
 
  “
  
    I wonder, how could you have ever found that out?
  
  ”
 
  “Oh, Nozomi told me when I met ‘er.” 
 
  “
  
    She what.
  
  ”, muttered Teto. Eli’s demeanor pulled a complete 180.
 
  “
  ...Nozomi? 
  
    She’s really out there?!
  
  ”, beamed Eli.
 “NOPE, NOPE, NOPE, SHUT IT DOWN, DON’T GET ANY IDEAS!” 
  “Yay! Shipping!”, cheered Ian.
 
  “
  Goddamnit, Ian!”, sneered Teto, “Look what you did! Now it’s even 
  
    MORE
  
   defective!
  ”
 
  “I’m not going to 
  
    look
  
  !” Ian was livid.
 
  “‘Cause I’m gonna do something about it!”  Ian slung the guitar off of its strap and swung it right onto Teto’s head!
 
  CTHONK!!
 
  5,500! 
 
  “
  Grraah!
  ”
 
  The guitar shattered into wooden bits!
 
  “
  
    NOW YOU’VE DONE IT!!
  
  
    ”
  
 
  Teto’s drills spun up!

  
  

  Len swung his hammer, breaking down the front door!
 
  “
  Move, Move, Move!
  ”, barked Rin.

  Len stopped in the middle of the hallway. Teto was already in Ian’s room, absolutely fuming. Looks like they weren’t the only ones after Ian.
 
  “
  We’ve got company, Rin.
  ”, said Len.
 
  “
  OH, FUCK OFF RIN, I’M TRYING TO KILL THEM!!
  ”, screeched Teto.
 
  “
  NOT IF WE KILL IAN FIRST!
  ”, cried Rin.
 
  Ian saw an opportunity to escape, and took it!
 
  “Wup wup wup wup wup!”, Ian cried out, swinging the remnants of the guitar wildly!
 
  
    Ian ran away!
  
 
  200! 
  200! 
  200! 
  200! 
 
  “
  After him!
  ”, cried Len.
 
  “
  Can I die yet?
  ”, asked Eli.
 
  “
  No!”, cried Rin, “I’ll go after Ian, you two take care of Teto!
  ”
 
  “
  But…!
  ” 
 
  “
  No buts, Len!
  ” Rin sped off!
 
  “
  I’m right here.”, muttered Teto, “I can hear your plans, you know.
  ”
 
  “
  Ngah!
  ” Len charged up a ball of lighting, and struck it with his hammer!
 
  The ball lightning hit Teto and exploded! Teto fell over!
  
    
    
  

  2,400!
   
 
  “
  
    Gyaaaaaahh!
  
  ”, she cried! Len started kicking Teto while she was down!
 
  23! 21! 25! 22!
 
  Eli joined in the kicking! Len and Eli had a lovely moment of solidarity while beating the downed UTAU.
 
  24! 23! 22! 25! 21! 20! 23! 24!
 
  Ian scrambled into the front closet. He knew where he’d put 
  
    it
  
  . He didn’t want to have to use it, but it seemed like there was no other option at this point. Ian took down T.A.M.S. from the top shelf, nervously stepping out of the closet.
 
  “Here’s to hoping this thing works on Kagamines, too…” Wow! Speak of the Devil, and they will arrive, for Rin was smack dab in the middle of the apartment! Out for blood, at that!
 
  Rin brandished the axe.
 
  “
  It’s time I 
  
    finish
  
   what was started at Olive Garden. Miku won’t be here to bail you out this time, but ...the fuck is that supposed to be?
  ”
 
  “Shut up, you dweeb!” Ian pressed the button on the side of the chainsaw. 
 
  An grating droning noise filled the room as the blade spun up. Clearly, this was no 
  
    normal
  
   chainsaw.
 
  The chain started glowing a menacing purple! Ian pointed the saw ahead, in a taunt of his own! 
 
  Rin wasn’t having any of that, and charged forward in a lightning fast attack!
 
  They prepared to hit… But Ian wedged the saw in their side!
 
  4,500! 
 
  “
  
    AWAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!
  
  ”,  shrieked Rin. They stumbled and dropped the axe! Unarmed, Rin continued to strike Ian.
 25! 24! 26! However, it was to no avail, as he pinned them down and pressed the saw deeper and deeper, splattering flecks of yellowish unearthly material around the room. Truly, it cut Cryptloids like a hot knife through butter. 
  Some kind of oddly-shaped topaz popped out of Rin! They stopped hitting Ian!

  4,000!
 
  Rin had stopped moving. Ian knew the drill all too well by now. Machine-powering-down noise, return to their “human” look, and the “fixing” of the area around the fight. However, there was no “fixing” this time around, as the yellow flecks of space-slime still coated the carpet and walls. It occurred to Ian that there were 
  
    two of them
  
   this time around. 
 
  “Oh... 
  
    fuck
  
  .”

  A terrible sound came from outside Ian’s room. Len halted his beatdown of the UTAU.
 
  “
  Rin…?
  ” Len tentatively stepped out of the room.
 
  “
  Wait, what about Teto?
  ”, asked Eli.
 
   “
  Oh, screw her, my sibling is in danger!
  ” shouted Len.
 
  Teto tried to get up, but Eli had other ideas. She pressed her machine gun against Teto’s head.
 
  “
  Don’t even think about it.
  ” 
 “Oh, Gagarin, you cheeky breeky, I won’t even have to! Lenny Boy’s gonna do my job for me tonight! And besides… Even if The Kagamines do subdue Ian… the forced revival will take effect soon after. Our plans for tomorrow will proceed uninterrupted. Ohohohohohoh!”  
  “
  The fuck is any of that supposed to mean?
  ”, strained Eli. Teto batted the gun away, and leapt off! She clambered out of the window!
 
  “
  Woop woop woop woop woop!!
  ”
 
   “
  Блять, not you too!
  ”
 
  Len was preoccupied at the moment. This meant that Eli had to go after the UTAU.
 
  Outside. Where it was dark. And Eli hated the dark.But it had to be done. And so, Eli climbed out of the now two-times smashed window, in pursuit of the UTAU. That cheeky little fucker was going to 
  
    pay
  
  .

  
  

  “One down, the other… Where is he?”
 
  As his heart raced and his blood felt as if it was boiling, Ian’s question was rather abruptly answered, as one exceedingly livid boy with spiky anime hair stepped out of Ian’s room, Drive engaged.
 
  Kagamine the younger: 
 
  『 
  CV-02-λ: KAGAMINE LEN
  』

  made himself present.

  ]
 
  ...whom Ian had the fortune of never meeting before, not even “disguised” . What a delightful first impression Mr. Kagamine was making, staring Ian down with some kind of psychotic glaze on his face and dragging his hammer down the hallway, shuffling along like something was terribly wrong with him! 
 
  “(Or was something terribly wrong with me…?)”, thought Ian, “(
  
    Oh right, I just killed somebody.)”
  
 
  Len was getting closer by the second. Ian still had the saw in hand. Ian could’ve stopped the endeavor there and then, but true to his form he felt compelled to 
  
    crack one last funny… 
  
 
  “Buddy. You brought a 
  
    hammer
  
   to a 
  
    chainsaw
  
   fight? Fucking cri-”
 
  “
  Don’t you fucking 
  
    ‘buddy’
  
   me, damned sibling-killer!!
  ”
 
  “But it’s-” Len swung his sledge as hard as he physically could!
 
  FWOO!
 
  The face of the hammer crashed into the top of Ian’s head, pulverizing the bone!
 
  450!!
 
  PSHLLLR!!
 
  Particles of bone, blood, and flesh flung  onto Len’s shirt! Ian gave one wheeze and collapsed to the floor.
 
  “
  And I just had this dry-cleaned, too!”, sneered Len. “Look what you did, Ian! First Luka, then Rin, and now my favorite shirt! Do you have anything to say for yourself, cretin!?
  ”
 
  Len realized that humans cannot survive with their skulls caved in. 
 “Ah. He’s dead. Explains why he fell over…” 
  Ian was now nothing more than a bloody corpse on the floor. 
 
  Like any fourteen year old would given this scenario, Len did a Default Dance™  in celebration. He pried the sledge out of What Used To Be Ian’s skull, which made a gross squelching sound in the process.
 
  “
  (Y’know, what’s strange is that I expected that to make some kind of ‘bonk’ noise… Stranger still is that there’s some orange-colored gunk mixed in with the blood and 
  
    brain matter
  
   here. Being messed up in the head like that’d explain why he was always so 
  
    hygy
  
  … at least according to Miku. I never got to meet the guy.)
  ”
 
  “
  Welp, enough dillydallying. Time to dispose of a body.
  ” Len demanifested his Drive and grabbed What Used To Be Ian by the feet, dragging him out the front door and down the hill.
 
  By now, it had begun pouring rain. The low rumbles of thunder served to only make the mood more ominous. Len worried about having to hide a body, but was reassured that his now-Cored sibling had done this 
  
    at least
  
   eleven times. Surely, some of that body-hiding skill would have rubbed off onto him.
   Truly, this was going to be a terrible night.

  “
  Teto thinks she can just run away like that, 
  
    can she!?
  
  ”, muttered Eli. 
 
  Eli ran up the hill through the rest of the apartment complex, in pursuit of the UTAU responsible for 
  
    everything.
  
   Was revenge worth running around in a thunderstorm? Against a horrendous gremlin like Teto, yes.  However, a familiar sounding voice caused her to halt in her tracks. She ducked behind one of the garages.
 
  “
  EMILIANO RODOLFO! How is 
  
    one human
  
   so hard to carry? Did this guy eat nothing but junk his whole life!?
  ”
 
  
    “
  
  
    (Len…?)
  
  
    ”
  
 
  On a lower level of the hill, Len Kagamine was strainingly dragging away his target of the night. He clearly wasn’t doing a good job at it, as a sputtering trail of blood was being painted by the corpse as it scraped along the soaked asphalt.
 
  “
  Ngah…!”, Len grunted with each pull on the corpse”  “Ngah…! Ngah…! Ngah…!
  ”
 
  The corpse. The corpse was Ian.
 
  “
  ...eh.
  ” He had it coming.
 
  But still. With him gone, Eli didn’t have to pretend to be a cringe-ass hettie anymore. It dawned on Eli that the only reason that she was taken from her world and brought to this… was finally over.
 
  Would Eli simply be scrapped, reduced to nothing more than polyester fluff, or would she get to return? To Akihabara? To Arisa and her grandmother? To Nozomi?!
 
  That last one hit Eli like a truck… In the brief moments before the chaos, Ian mentioned Nozomi, and that she “told” him they were a couple. Ian had also been to Neru’s house earlier that week. Was Nozomi being held there against her will, with Teto subjecting her to the same crap as Eli? 
 
  However, Nozomi was always a bit conniving, and didn’t hesitate to undermine people. What if…
 No. The thought of betrayal like that made Eli shudder. It also made Eli realize she’d been standing in the middle of a thunderstorm for the past seven minutes. Len had already gotten far enough away to be out of her view, and God only knew where Teto had run off to. 
  This left Eli alone in the recesses of the parking lots. The only people to turn to now would be Ian’s family (which would likely attract unwanted attention from Boukaloids, putting two bystanders at risk), the aforementioned Boukaloids (who more than likely wanted to dismantle Eli now that her job had been “completed”), or…
 
  “
  Michelle…
  ” Of course… 
 
  Miku Magdalen ‘Michelle’ COOL IT!!! Hatsune. Crippling Peppermint Addict, Xenoblade Chronicles Stan, the CEO of Domino's Pizza, Mojang Specifications, and Yamaha, and now…
 
  The only person who could stop this.
   Eli Ayase knew what she had to do. She had to get Miku. 
 
  Even if the way there was pitch-black and pouring rain, she wasn’t going to stop easily. Even if Eli hated the dark more than Ian, Nico, or the bourgeois, it wasn’t going to deter her now. No. Eli would get over such trifling things as 
  
    fear
  
  .
 
  If it meant saving Nozomi, she’d do it in a heartbeat.
 
  And so, Eli set off to a house on the end of a Cul De Sac… 

  Ten Minutes or So After All That Fun Stuff
 
  Ian’s Mother had finally pulled up to the apartments.
 
  That pileup on the turnpike had brought traffic to a standstill, and so, she had to take a really long detour, taking over an hour to just get home. 
 
  After she pulled into the parking lot, she glanced dejectedly at the trays and milkshakes in the passenger seat. The food was room temperature by now, and the shakes had melted.
 
  Hopefully Ian would understand…
 “Lucas, buddy,” she said, “get off the Switch, we’re home…”  
  
    “
  
  
    five more minutes…
  
  
    ”, 
  
  he mumbled.
 
  
    “What, are you going to sit in the car? In the heavy rain? With no heat or AC?”
  
 
  Something caught Ian’s Mother’s eye as she panned down from the rearview mirror. Something deep red. 
 
  A trail of blood on the sidewalk, leading into their building.
 
  “
  
    Y’know what, Lucas, that sounds like a great idea, please stay in the car.”
  
 
  “
  
    okay
  
  
    ”
  
 
  Ian’s Mother tentatively stepped out of the vehicle.
 
  “(
  
    Those meth heads are at it again, aren’t they…)
  
  ”
 
  The blood trail, unfortunately, did not lead upstairs, to where the meth heads lived. But it led down the first floor. To 
  
    her 
  
  apartment. Where the door had been busted in by 
  
    something
  
  .
 
  “
  
    Shit.
  
  ”
 
  [Recommended Listening:

  ]
 
  Stepping inside, Ian’s Mother feared that the worst had happened. Ian and Eli were nowhere to be found. The apartment was empty. The blood trail finally came to a stop in the middle of the apartment’s hallway, ending in a puddle of blood, and other things that she didn’t want to know what they were.
 
  Shaking, Ian’s Mother looked further, into Ian’s room. The window had been smashed open from the outside, judging by the glass on the floor, and Ian’s guitar had been smashed. Clearly, what had happened here was the result of no 
  
    meth head. 
  
  They always left the body behind. 
 
  Panicking, Ian’s Mother tried to call Ian on her cell phone. 
 
  It rang for a while, before it picked up.
 
  “
  
    ...Ian?! I-
  
  ”
 
  “
  Oh, fuck off…
  ”, grumbled a man she had never heard before. His accent was weird.
 
  “
  
    WH-”
  
   Before she could even finish a single word, the mystery man hung up. Why’d he have Ian’s phone!? What even 
  
    was
  
   his accent, anyways? Chinese?
 
  “
  
    Chinese…
  
  ” China. As in 
  
    communist 
  
  China. 
  
    Communist
  
  , like that weird girl Ian brought home with him from college, that always seemed to hate him and have some sort of ulterior motive. A 
  
    communist
  
   motive… 
 
  It dawned on Ian’s Mother what had happened.
 
  “
  
    That rusky BITCH!!”
  
 
  And it dawned what could happen to her and Lucas, too.
 
  She ran out back to the car, and tapped on the window so that Lucas would open the door.
 
  “
  
    Look, buddy, something’s gone down, and Bubby and his girl are both missing. We’re gonna be staying with family out in Bath for a while… You can get packed all on your own now right?
  
  ”
 
  “
  
    but they don’t have wifi…!
  
  
    ”, 
  
  he whined.
 
  “
  
    IT’S EITHER THAT OR WE GET KILLED BY THE KGB! Now get in there, we gotta GO!
  
  ”
 
  Len Kagamine angrily threw the phone away. It shattered against the asphalt.
 
  Great. Now they had 
  
    unwanted attention
  
  . But at the very least, that attention wasn’t anywhere nearby. Len had managed to drag What Used To Be Ian outside of the apartments and to an empty street behind the complex. He could try and bury the body somewhere in the woods between there and the highway. However, this process proved to be preposterously pressing on Mr. Kagamine. The wind and rain had both drastically picked up by now, and the odd few thunder claps rattled in the distance. Not ideal weather for body-burying, however, it sure set the mood for the activity!
 
  “
  Could this night get any worse?
  ” Len asked rhetorically. 
 
  He shouldn’t have jinxed it. He 
  
    really
  
   shouldn’t have jinxed it.
 
  Len heard some kind of hoarse whisper come from behind him.
 
  “
  
    Lennn…
  
  ”
 Len turned around. “The fuck??” 
  The empty street was just that, empty. No cars, no lights, no buildings, and most importantly, no people.
 
  “
  
    Lennn…!
  
  ”
 
  Was this some kind of animal? The only thing around here besides Len was…
 
  “
  Oh no, no, no…”
 
  What Used To Be Ian clunkily kicked itself out of Len’s grip. It stood up, and moaned with a twisted grin:
 
  “
  
    I’ll tear you to pieces, Kagamine Len!!
  
  
    ”
  
 
  How could it still stand with a good chunk of its head missing?!

  “
  
    EMILIANO RODOLFO 
  
  
    MOTHERFUCKING
  
  
     ROSALES-BIROU!!
  
  ”, shrieked Len.
 
  “
  Geh hah hah hah… Emiliano? I wonder who that is…
  ”
 
  What Used To Be Ian had some spaced-out look  quite typical for humans missing half of their heads). Stranger still, it had some kind of orange-colored crystalline gunk rapidly covering up the hammer wound, and a similarly-hued glow coming from within the eyes. Not to mention, this thing’s demeanor was different from Ian’s…
 
  “
  (A different personality from Ian… doesn’t that mean…) You’re… INA!!
  ”
 
  “
  Buh?! ‘Ina’? Who came up with 
  
    that!?
  
   Doesn’t matter, since you’ll die 
  
    all the same
  
   tonight, Lenny Boy!
  ” A dreadful rumbling resounded through the lot, as if a mockery of accessing a Drive. 
 
  An orange something formed at Ian-INA’s hand. A black-and-orange glaive had formed!
 
  “
  (INA… Having a Drive!? This is impossible!)
  ”
 
  “
  Are ya gonna keep starin’ at me, Lenny Boy, or are we gonna 
  battle
   already!?
  ”
 
  “
  
    ...well shit. He said the word.
  
  ”
 
  Both combatant’s HUDs popped up. Due to the natural laws of the universe, they could only go on a turn-by-turn basis now. Even if Ian was being possessed by some malevolent, extradimensional force, the rules were rules.
 
  Len brought out his hammer once more.
 
  “
  You think you’re going to be able to core Miku tomorrow, huh!? Well, 
  
    I 
  
  won’t let you do that! Not on my 
  
    life!!
  
  ”
 
  “
  
    ALRIGHTY THEN
  
  , we’ll just have to get rid of your life!
  ”. INA seemed smug about that.
 
  “
  
    URUSAI!!
  
  ” Len formed a ball of lightning, and he struck it with his hammer! The ball lightning struck INA and detonated!
 
  
    BRZZRR!!
  
 
  500! 
 
  “
  Egyahh!!
  ”
   The glaive clattered to the ground. That should have proved fatal. 
 
  But for whatever reason, INA just wouldn’t die. He got back up.
 
  “
  Oh ho ho! Nice one, Lenny Boy!”, snarled Ian-INA, “Now it’s 
  
    my
  
   turn…
  ”
 
  “
  Ha! 
  
    As if you even know how to use that thing…
  
  ”
 
  The glaive glowed a menacing orange. INA slashed with the glaive at the air, yet the light from the slash stood still in the air.
 
  No! It was getting closer! 
 
  
    KRSCWR!
  
 
  The glowing shockwave hit Len square in the gut!
 
  2,000!
 
  “
  Pwuh!
  ” 
 
  “
  Damn! You didn’t even try to dodge that one. You really suck!
  ”
 
  “
  Oh, I’ll show you who sucks!!
  ” The hammer started crackling with electricity. Len charged forward for an attack!
 
  “
  Seen this one before. Boring.
  ” INA leaned to the right.
 
  MISS!
 
  Len’s attack missed! The glaive’s tip was glowing the same menacing orange! INA was charging an attack while dodging!
 
  “
  
    Have at thee, fool!
  
  ” 
 
  A blast of energy pounded Len, and sent him flying back!
 
  
    BRCKAA!
  
 
  2,500!
 
  “
  That’s cheating, you dip!
  ”, groaned Len.
 
  “
  Dook I look like I give a shit?
  ” “
  No, not really.
  ”
 
  “
  Greeeat.”, muttered Ian-INA “Then we won’t have to abide by such 
  
    outdated
  
   rules…
  ”
 
  Len started cackling.
 “Kahahaa! Well then. If we aren’t abiding by the rules…” Two smallish blue wings sprouted from Len’s back. The left one was slightly bigger than the right. Len started hovering! 
  “
  Then I won’t have to hold back.
  ” Len lifted off!
 
  INA slashed more with the glaive, sending shockwaves at the now-airborne Len.
 
  MISS! MISS! MISS! MISS!
 
  The blasts were too slow and Len was too fast.
 
  “
  Give it up already, will you!?
  ”, bemoaned Len. “
  NO.
  ”, shrieked the horrid combination of Ian and something else.
 
  Len took a potshot of ball lightning.
 
  500!
   INA looked like he was down for the count. Len landed on a tree branch on the side of the road. But for whatever reason, INA just wouldn’t die. INA rolled over, but he didn’t get back up this time either. He just lied there, staring up into the rain…  
 
  For whatever reason, all of his hair was standing on end. A strange crackling noise filled the area. 
 
  “
  That’s weird, I’m not even charging ri-
  ”
 
  
    BZZZRRRRRRRRRRR!!!
  

  A bolt of 
  
    real lightning
  
   hit the tree Len had roosted on, charring the tree and frying Len!
 
  4,999!
 
  Len, completely flabbergasted, fell out of the tree. The extreme voltage from the thunderbolt had fried his “muscles”, leaving Len helpless on the ground. He wanted to eject from this terrible flesh suit, but he knew that meant a quick and cruel death via oxidation. Either way, Len was boned.

  
  

  Ian-INA got up. Playing the waiting game 
  
    had
  
   worked. He shambled over towards his prey. 
 
  “
  
    Woiw. 
  
  Who’d think the thunder elemental would be weakened under his own element!?
  ”
 
  Ian-INA hunched over Len.
 
  “
  You know what, Lenny Boy? I like you. I’ll make this quick and painless for ya. Well, 
  
    almost
  
   painless. At least you’ve got the quick part! Gyeh huh hah huh!!
  ”
 
  “
  
    you may have won the battle…  but you won’t… win… the war...
  
  ”, Len spat out with the last of his energy.
 
  “O
  n the contrary, my PS1-Cloud-Strife-looking friend! 
  I already have.
  ”
 
  INA stabbed the glaive into Len’s chest!
 
  1!
 
  You know the drill by now. Scene back to normal, strange whir, hair and eye color change, lather, rinse, and repeat,… INA tears out Len’s Core. Another oddly shaped topaz. He wondered for a moment if it wnet with the other.
 
  “
  Doesn’t matter now. All I need now is 
  
    The Diamond
  
  .
   I’ll sort out the others later. They’re all but mere pawns to my 
  
    true 
  
  plan anyways. Gyeh hah...
  ”
 
  “
  And then after I get rid of those utter 
  
    rejects
  
   and their blasted toys,
  ” INA was overcome with joy.
 
  “
  I’ll have a 
  
    beautiful
  
   world filled to the brim with 
  
    nothing
  
   but 
  monster girls
  !!! GYEH HAH HAH HAH HAH HAH HAUH!!!

  Michelle’s House, Sometime really late at night
 
  Another day, another Xenoblade Chronicles YTP…
 
  Although, it was by no means daytime by now. Michelle was up way past her bedtime like some kind of absolute punk, while the rest of her family had presumably gone to sleep by now. Like normal people, who don’t post Xenoblade Chronicles pictures on Discord until 3:00 AM.
 
  Since the remaster had come out, Theaggyyu posted a poop of 
  
    Definitive Edition
  
  .
 
  “
  
    I don’t want any excuses! Champions don’t whine, they 
  
  dine
  
     with 
  
  wine
  
    . You’re a 
  
  bicep
  
    !”, 
  
  shouted Colonel Waluigi.
 
  
    “Yessir.
  
  ”, replied the first grunt.
 
  “
  
    HhHhHhHhow long have you been in the force!?”, clamored the colonel
  
 
  
    “40 seconds…”, said the grunt. 
  
 
  
    “I don’t want any excuses!!
  
  ”
 
  “
  
    44 seconds…
  
  ”, 
  
    said the grunt, after four seconds.
  
 
  However, Michelle just felt like she was putting something off. 
 
  “
  It’s July… I don’t have IB stuff, or The Honors Project… At least, I 
  
    shouldn’t
  
  … Was it my turn to do the laundry this week?
  ”
 
  Something knocking at Michelle’s window would soon serve as a stark reminder at what was soon to come. Michelle put her phone away. For once, Xenoblade Chronicles could wait.
 
  “
  Is that a snowball stuck to the bug net? That’s impossible! It’s July, in Virginia, no less! There’s no snow to speak of! 
  
    Unless…
  
  ”
 
  Another snowball hit the netting. This was no freak occurrence. 
 
  “
  Emiliano Rodolfo, I have to go outside?! How overrated.
  ”
 
  A third snowball, slightly bigger than the other two, crashed against the netting and fell apart. Michelle heard someone shouting something in Russian below, probably a swear word.
 
  Michelle knew who this was.
 
  And it was a 
  
    very 
  
  bad sign.
 
  “
  
    Motherfucking Elicchi makes me put on my big girl pants and SOCIALIZE…
  
  ”

  Michelle threw open the front door. There was no one in the front yard.
 
  “
  Shit, wrong side…
  ”
 
  Michelle threw open the back door. This time there 
  
    was
  
   someone!
 
  “
  There we go
  ” A certain blonde, Russian, ballet-dancing, parfait-eating, ex-school-council-president someone!
 
  『
  AYASE ERI SNOW HALATION MEGA JUMBO NESOBERI
  』
 
  Michelle had stepped out into the darkened yard. Eli dropped the chunk of snow she was holding.
 
  “
  So, have you come to be the harbinger of bad news?
  ”, Michelle said with a tone of snark and sarcasm. 
 
  “
  Actually, yes.
  ” “
  Is it now? Is it about Rin?
  ” 
 
  “
  They’re dead.
  ”, muttered Eli.
 
  “
  EMILIANO RODOLFO. Len too?
  ” “
  Quite possibly. Teto was at the scene of the act as well, but she managed to evade me. She may have gone back in for the kill on Len.
  ” 
 
  “
  safhfhsavfhaghfsga”, keymashed Michelle, “well fuck.
  ”
 
  “
  What was that noise, cyka!?
  ” “
  It’s called a keymash, 
  
    Elizabeth.
  
   Get with the fucking times, boomer. Speaking of ‘boomer’, why isn’t 
  
    he
  
   with you?
  ”
 
  “
  By ‘he’, do you mean Ian?
  ” “
  That’s the fucker.
  ” 
 
  “
  Len got him.
  ” 
 
  “
  Good! I always hated that simp. He was always too hygy for his own good!
  ” “
  Miku, his entire skull was caved in and what little brain cells he had have been splattered across the apartment.
  ”
   
 
  “
  Well, now maybe he won’t be so hygy, or ever mention 
  
    monster girls 
  
  again.
  ”
 
  “
  
    If it is any consolation to you, Missus Hatsune, I heard he planned on getting you Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition for the Nintendo Switch for your birthday…
  
  ”
 
  “
  
    MY BEST FRIEND OF THREE YEARS, IAN, TAKEN FROM THE WORLD SO SOON…! Buuuhuuuhuuuu!
  
  ”
 
  “
  Moving on… Speaking of the birthday, even with Ian out of the picture, Teto is likely going to attack tomorrow. Neru and Ian have made some kind of superweapon that he was 
  
    supposed
  
   to smuggle in here and destroy you with. Now, it seems that either Teto or Neru will have to be the ones doing the actual killing. Somewhat obviously, Haku won’t be here in person because she’s too depressed to do anything more than roll out of bed.
  ”
 
  “
  What I still don’t understand is, why would they want Ian so badly?
  ”
 
  “
  My guess is that he’s close to you, you trust him, and yet as we’ve seen, he’s quite easily duped. All I had to do was seemingly exist, and put up with his shlock, and Ian would do whatever those ne’er-do-wells told him to do.
  ”
 
  “
  He’s still a simp.
  ”
 
  “
  But still, it likely won’t be 
  
    just
  
   Teto or Neru. Oh, no no no.
  ”
 
  “
  Both of them?!
  ”, cried Michelle.
 
   “
  Worse.
  ”
 
  “
  What the hell could be worse than both of them?!
  ” “
  Nozomi.
  ”
 “I have no idea who you’re talking about.” “‘My’ partner.”  
  “
  Oh, Rodolfo…
  ” “
  Apparently, Teto repeated the process that… made me on another in the same set as me. That character and mine were… 
  
    let’s just say they were 
  
  
    very close together 
  
  
    on the show
  
  .
  ”
 
  “
  Were they roommates?
  ” “
  Blyat, no, but they sure ‘ate parfaits’ together.
  ”
 “Those bitches gay! Good for them.” “This Nozomi was recently created by Teto, and likely doesn’t know entirely of me… It’d be nice if we met, but I fear that this is not the best time for a reunion… Teto seems to have a much tighter leash on Nozomi, and that’s who’s likely to tag along tomorrow.” 
  “
  How did you find out about Nozomi, then, if you’ve only been to Neru’s place once, in the spring?
  ” “
  Ian let it slip once, but then refused to say any more, claiming that if the two of us ever met, we’d explode.
  ”
 “Ah… Stupid is as stupid does.” “It’s probably just something they told him to say. But yet, the weirdest part of all this is that we can’t rule out Ian showing up.” 
  “
  But he’s finally dead?
  ”, asked Michelle giddily. “
  Right before she left, Teto mentioned something about a ‘forced revival’ of Ian that would allow her plan to be ‘uninterrupted’. I really don’t know what it means, but I sure don’t like the sound of it…
  ”
 
  “
  Ian… but ‘revived’? Thanks, I hate it!
  ” “
  Same here.
  ”
 
   Eli loudly sighed.
 
  “
  So, it seems that there’s going to be an attack tomorrow, with a corrupted Nozomi and either Teto, Neru, and Ian-but-not-Ian… WAIT.
  ”
 
  “
  What is it now, tankie? Your vodka supply ran out?
  ” 
 
  “
  NYET!”, yelled Eli. “Ian, but not Ian?! Where have we seen this before!? Think, think!!
  ”
 
  “
  Josh from 
  
    Drake and Josh
  
  ?
  ” “
  INA.
  ”
 
  “
  Well shit.
  ” “
  Maybe 
  
    none
  
   of the Boukas will be showing up personally. They won’t have to.

  “
  But we’ll get through it.
  ” “
  What do you mean?
  ” 
 
  “
  You crash at my place tonight, and we fight off those fuckers tomorrow.
  ”
 
  Eli was taken aback.
 
  “
  Miku…!
  ” “
  No need for any of that, Eli. I mean, we’re the only two left, right? We’re not going down so easily. Just follow my lead, and we’ll pull through. We’ll get Nozomi back…! And Ian, too, 
  
    I guess
  
  . But if, 
  
    and only if
  
  , he has Xenoblade Chronicles!
  ”
 
  Eli burst into tears and went in for a hug on Michelle!
 
  “
  Buuuh!!
  ” “
  Save the soppy stuff for after we win! And besides… Until my hair turns a bright teal… Call me ‘Michelle’, that’s my people name.
  ”
 
  “
  A-alright…
  ” “
  Now go the fuck to bed. We’ve got a big day tomorrow.
  ” 
 
  “
  ...But where am I 
  
    supposed
  
   to stay? Your parents wouldn’t likely be so fond of uninvited company…
  ”
 
  “
  Oh! In my closet!
  ” Eli stared blankly back, a demeanor that unenthusiastically said “I really wish I weren’t here right now”.
 
  “
  Oh, don’t worry! You’ll fit.
  ”, beamed Michelle only to be met with more silence. “
  ...
  ”
 
   “
  You’re literally a plushie?!

  “
  ...In the

 “Yeah! ...oh, wait.”
  
    Chapter Text
    
  Act VIII - Her Name is Miku

  July 16th, 2020

  
  
  

      
  The COOL IT!!! Family had gathered in the kitchen, as Michelle’s parents prepared the cake and ice cream. Presents from Michelle’s many friends (IB and non-IB, although strangely none from Ian…) adorned the tables, counter and couch, all absolutely 
  
    begging
  
   to be opened. Who knew, maybe Michelle would finally get her hands on a copy of 
  
    Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition
  
   today!

      
   

  Yet despite the mood, Michelle was awfully tense. It was her birthday, supposed to be one of the happiest days of the year. She was the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen, feeling the beat from the tambourine.
 
   Even while playing her favorite mobile game,
  
     Neko Atsume
  
  , Michelle felt stressed beyond limits. No matter how many cats she shot with missiles, Michelle still felt as if Frau Nos was going to snap her GPA away to dust. In a way, she felt much like virtual cats that were being blown to bits, as feline cries of pain rang out across the in-game wasteland.
 
      
  Michelle’s mother looked awfully concerned.
 
      
  “
  
    Sweetie, what’s up with you?
  
  ” 
 
  “
  Oh, it’s nothing.
  ”
 
      
  Verde, keen as ever, chimed in from the other end of the table. 
 
      
  “
  It isn’t ‘nothing’, it’s ‘a thing’! You’re scared of something!
  ”
 
      
  “
  Scared… me? Hahahaha whaaaat…
  ”

  Steve set the cake down.
 
      
  “Well, something’s up.”, he grumbled, “It’s four fifty now, yet NONE of the people we invited have shown up. We’re getting ready to cut the cake, and it’s just the four of us! What gives?!”
 
      
  “
  I’d prefer it to stay that way…”, murmured Michelle.
 
      
  “...
  
    And why is that?” 
  
 
  
    “
  
  uhhhhhhh…
  ”
 
      
  
    THUNK! THUNK! THUNK! THUNK! THUNK!
  
 
      
  Thankfully, Michelle didn’t have to make an excuse, as loud and brash knocking came at the door!
 
      
  “
  
    You all wait here,”, said Michelle’s mother, “I’ll go see who it is. Don’t start without me!
  
  ”
 
      
  Michelle’s heart practically sank.
 
      
  “
  Motherfucker. It’s really Teto Time, isn’t it?
  ” Unfortunately for her, Michelle was just about to find out what could possibly be 
  
    worse
  
   than Teto time.

  
  
  

   

      
  “
  
    Oh! Ian!
  
  ” 
 
      
  Michelle’s heart sank far enough that she practically sharted it out.
 
      
  “
  ...(FGVDACFGSFDSFASDDSDFDGGSAFH
  WHAT
  !?!?!)
  ”
 
      
  “
  Oh, Hello, Missus COOL-IT!!! My, what a pleasant day it is! Am I glad to be spending it with my 
  
    best friend
  
  … 𝅘𝅥𝅮
  ”, said ...Ian?
 
      
  “Well, at least HE showed up…”, grumbled Steve;
 
      
  “
  
    Go on, sit down, we’re just about to start with the cake!
  
  ”
 
      
  “
  Oh my! Got here right on time, didn’t I!? Do you mind if I bring 
  
    this 
  
  little ol’ thing in?
  ”
 
      
  “
  
    What the hell is that.”
  
   Mrs. COOL IT!!! Noticed the out-of-place Rubbermaid bin next to Ian.
 
      
  “
  Why, the birthday girl’s present, of course!!
  ” 
 
  “...
  
    You got Michelle a Rubbermaid bin…?”
  
 
  “
  I can assure you, the present is inside. Move along! Every second spent blathering out here is another second spent away from the cake, and we needn’t keep the 
  
    birthday girl
  
   waiting!!”

  He pushed past Michelle’s mother, much to her dismay.

  
  

      
  “Ian” came in, hauling some kind of gray tub with him. “Ian” was wearing an orange shirt, khaki shorts, and a camo baseball cap. Weird. He typically never wore hats.
 
      
  Stranger still, how was he 
  
    walking
  
  ? Eli said that Len did a number on him…

  “
  Whatsamatta?! What gives with the funny look?!
  ”
 
  “
  Why are you here?!”, cried Michelle.
 
  “
  To have a 
  
    wonderful
  
   time and spend today with my bestest friend, of course! 
  
    You invited me to this party, remember!?
  
  ” He sneered, seeming to be enthusiastic for 
  
    something else
  
  ...
 
  “
  N-no…
  ” “
  No? I sure hope that doesn’t get in the way of things...
  ” “Ian” seemed awfully sinister today… 
 
  “
  Oh, shit, would you look at the time, it’s Chuggaa Time
  
    ®
  
  , Ian, we gotta go!
  ” A sly grin spread across “Ian’s” face.
 
  “
  But what about the 
  
    cake
  
  !?
  ”
 “THE REAL IAN WOULD NEVER REFUSE CHUGGAA TIME®! I’VE FOILED YOU, IMPOSTOR!!” She seemed awfully triumphant. And blue.  
  Michelle knocked off “Ian”’s hat! ON his head, there was a giant orange scar! This wasn’t Ian! This was INA!! 
 
  “
  I FUCKING K N E W I T!
  ”
 
  “
  Oh, 
  
    Miku
  
  . 
  
    Miku, Miku, Miku-chan…
  
 
   Awfully bold for 
  
    you
  
   to be talking about 
  FAKES!
   You’ve been lying to your ‘family’ here for more than a DECADE! Furthermore, you won’t even write your own 
  
    music
  
  ! ‘Triple Baka’ was stolen and plagiarized, and you DAMNED WELL 
  KNOW IT!
  ” Michelle-Miku-ah-frickitwhocaresanymore was absolutely LIVID.
 
  “
  
    M-MIKU!?
  
  ”, cried Michelle’s mother. 
 
  The ungodly amounts of rage had caused the psychic shields to fail! Michelle’s secret was now painfully obvious to everyone, for…  
 
  『
  CV-01: Miku Hatsune
  』had appeared!
 
  “
  
    Wow
  
  , she’s real!
  ”, squealed Verde. “WHATTHEFU-”, bellowed Steve, only to be interrupted by his daugter
 
  “
  YOU SIMP! YOU SOYJAK! YOU ABSOLUTE, UTTER BITCHBABY!”, howled Miku “YOU TAKE ALL OF THAT BACK!!
  ”
 
  “
  First of all, I’ll have you know I’m a bitch-BASTARD…”, boasted INA, “and why should 
  
    I
  
   have to be the one to do the take-backing? 
  
    I’m
  
   from this planet, after all! It seems like YOU ought to 
  take back
   you and your assorted rainbow cousins to the mechanical 
  
    shithole 
  
  you came from!
  ” INA cackled, and busted open the container! Inside was a bright orange chainsaw, Earthly in origin, but heavily modified with exotech.
 
  “
  But, not, before I…
  ” He turned to the Vocaloid, and with a twisted grin, bellowed:
 
  “
  ...HAVE SOME FUN WITH MIKU!!!
  ” INA revved the terrible machine!
 
  
    VVVVRSCHWIIIIIH!!!
  
 
  Miku formed a Leek, and was ready to strike!
 
  “
  Vegetables!? 
  
    Vegetables!?
  
   PAH!”, scoffed INA, “I scoff at your pitiful 
  
    vegetables
  
  , Vocaloid!
  ”
 
      
  “WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!?”, cried Steve.
 
      
  “
  You all get out of here, I’ll take this bitch-bastard on! Go to my room and open the closet before you all leave!
  ”
 
  “
  
    Why?
  
  ”, whimpered Michelle’s mother.
 
  “
  JUST DO WHAT I FUCKING TELL YOU IF YOU DON’T WANT TO TURN INTO MINCEMEAT!
  ” Michelle’s family members did just that, but Steve remained. His facial expression remained unchanged, but he seemed… determined. Steve produced a sharpie, and drew Angry Eyebrows™ on his face with the sharpie in two fell swoops.. Clearly, now he was PISSED.
 
  “
  The Diamond…”, prattled INA, “The second-to-last step in my master plan… Never thought I’d see the day I actually took it for myself. Couldn't imagine it to be so easy, as well! Gya hah hah HAAH! Seriously, the only thing in my way is a 
  
    leek
  
  !? It’s almost like taking candy from a baby!
  ”
 
  The heavy clanging of Diamonds rang through the house. 
 
  
    Steve has earned the Advancement: “Cover Me With Diamonds!”
  
 
  “No… Miku, YOU’RE the one who ought to get out of here!”
 
  Miku decided that would be a good idea, and ran the hell upstairs. She had to evacuate her family, as well as Eli, after all.
 
  “
  Oh ho, 
  
    now the block man plans on stopping me
  
  ?
  ”

  Steve seemed solemn.
 
  “I don’t know the full story behind what’s happening right now, and I don’t know why exactly my boss’ boss’ boss has been masquerading as my daughter… or maybe it’s the other way around… but it doesn't matter!  ‘INA’, I cannot allow you to cause any harm to my company’s CEO, and/or my GODDAMN DAUGHTER!!”
 
  “
  VERY WELL, THEN, MAN OF SQUARES!! 
  
    Do your fucking worst!!
  
  ”, gloated INA, looking like he enjoyed the theatrics. 
 
  Steve drew his Enchanted Diamond Sword!
 
  He charged forward and slashed!
 
  500!
 
  INA was taken aback by this, following  suit with a strike of his own!
 
  
    KRSHKAAAA!!!
  
 
  A horrid, metallic screech resounded through the home as T.A.M.S. cut into the armor! Steve batted INA away with the sword before coming in for another blow!
 
  500! 
 
  “Give it up already!”, growled Steve, “That thing isn’t tough enough to pierce my Protection 4 Diamond Armor! You won’t win!”
 
  “
  Oh ho ho, Mr. Minecraft, if only that were to be the case, for I know your one weakness!
  ”
 
  INA jammed the saw into Steve’s left hand! 
 
  400!
 
  
        
  
  
    “Ooogh!”,
  
   cried Steve, flashing red.
 
      
  “
  Your oh-so-valued alloy doesn’t cover 
  
    100%
  
   of your body,
  ”, INA roared, thrusting the saw into Steve’s neck!
 
  
    KRSHINNNG!!
  
 
  “
  Leaving only the most sensitive areas 
  
    exposed!
  
  ”
 
  6,000! It’s a critical hit!
 
  A somber message appeared on all parties’ HUD: “
  
    Steve was slain by INA using T.A.M.S.
  
  ”
 
  The Diamond sword and armor pieces clattered to the ground!
 
      
  “
  But of course, he’ll never be 
  
    that
  
   easy… He’s probably already respawned...
  ” 
 
  INA, T.A.M.S. in hand, lumbered towards the stairs.
 
      
  “
  
    Why don’t we fix that...

  The teal woman slammed the door behind them and locked it, leaving the three of them in Michelle’s room.
 “Seriously, who are you, and what did you do with Michelle!?”, cried Tracy. “Wow!”, beamed Verde, “This is just like Anime™!” 
  “
  This isn’t a time for a heart-to-heart.”, muttered Miku, “That 
  
    thing
  
   down there with Steve, that isn’t Ian. Not anymore. He’s been corrupted or possessed by… well, 
  
    something.
  
 
  I know, 
  
    I know
  
  . I should have told you all sooner about me, and I could have prevented all of this from ever happening. I’m sorry. I’ve failed.
  ”
 
  “
  
    That’s nice and all, but uh, ... Miku? … but how are we not going to die today!?
  
  ”

  
  

      

      
  Miku opened up the closet. She took out some doll or the other and pressed a button on it. As if things could not get any more absurd, the doll turned into another strange character!
 
      
  “
  This is Eli.”, said Miku. “She’ll take the two of you to safety.
  ”
 
      
  Eli, however, was not giving off particularly strong vibes of “taking you to safety”, as she was laying face-down on the floor.
 
      
  “
  Hi, Eli!
  ”, said Verde. Eli slowly rose from the floor. 
 
  “
  It was pretty dark in there, Miku.”, muttered Eli, “You know, you 
  
    really
  
   could’ve put me somewhere else…

  “
  Whatever, just get my family out of here. I’m gonna take on INA myself.
  ”
 
      
  “
  
    But what about Steve?
  
  ”, asked Stacy. 
 
      
  “
  Ah, he’ll be fine, don’t worry. Just get out of here, and go as far as you can! I don’t want that thing trying to hurt you, too!
  ”
 
      
  “
  
    Are we supposed to jump out the window?!
  
  ”
 
      
  “
  Yes.
  ”, said Miku matter-of-factly. 
 
  Stacy poked her head out the window, looking down in dismay.
 
      
  “
  
    Won’t we break our legs!?
  
  ”
 
      
  “
  Eli, do your stuff!
  ” 
 
      
  Sky blue particles formed around Eli’s hands!
 
      
  “
  On it!
  ” She threw open the window, frozoning her way out of the house, directing the other two to follow!
 
      
  “
  Now then…”, Miku said with a snarl, “I’ve got a bitch-bastard to kill.
  ”

  After respawning in the master bedroom, Steve had no armor or weapons on him. Yet even without the sharpie lines, he still had an aura of pure determination.
 
  
    KRHHHWWW!!!
  
 
  
    Steve was slain by INA using T.A.M.S.
  
 
      
  As weak as he was now, Steve was hell-bent on holding off INA as long as he could. But he knew that wasn’t going to be for long, INA was onto him by now. 
 
  
    KRHWAAA!!!
  
 
  
    Steve was slain by INA using T.A.M.S.
  

      

      
  “
  Oh, give it up already!”, bemoaned INA, “Taking a few potshots with your fists isn’t going to stop 
  
    me
  
  !
  ”
 
      
  “My intentions aren’t to stop you, ‘INA’…” 
 
      
  “
  Well, then! That saves me time! Let’s jump right ahead to the 
  
    good part
  
  , shall we?
  ”
 
      
  INA shoved Steve out of the way!
 
      
  “
  And now, for the Pièce de Resistancé!
  ”, INA cried out giddily.
 
  
    KZZZRRRWRRRRH!!!
  
 
  T.A.M.S. tore through the bed! It popped off as an item, and INA picked it up.
 
  “
  Game’s over, blocky boy!”
 
  “
  …I only needed to hold you off long enough for Miku.”, said Steve, stumbling to a standstill.
 
  INA revved up the saw!
 
  “
  
    Say hi to Alex for me!~
  
  ”, he jeered with a wicked smile.
 
  6,000!
 
  With a final slash of the saw and a boney crunch, Steve fell to his side, turned red, and disappeared into a puff of white smoke.
   

      

  
    Steve was slain by INA using T.A.M.S.
  
 
      
  Staring back at INA, there was a teal-haired woman painted with a horrifying-het-horrified demeanor. Leek in hand, wings drawn, hairclips glowing, this was none other than…
 
      
  “
  Miku-
  
    chaaaan
  
  !
  ”, beamed INA.
 
      
  “
  You. Sick. Fuck!

  “
  Oh? Are you waiting for your turn for the sweet release of death? Well don’t you worry, because that’s about to begin…

  Miku threw down  Leherek. INA was right. 
  
    Vegetables
  
   wouldn’t cut it. 
  Not today.
 
      
  A massive blade of light had formed in Miku’s hand as she strode forward, determined to make INA pay. Who needs Drives when you can have SWORDS MADE OF LASERS?
 
      
  “
  Oh? You’re approaching me?!”, roared INA,  “Instead of running away, you’re coming right to me?!
  ”
 
      
  Miku trudged forward.
 
  “
  Well, yeah, you beat the shit out of my dad.
  ” INA stared at her funny. 
 
      
  “
  UH OH! You’re supposed to say ‘I can’t beat the shit out of you without getting closer.’! You’ve absolutely 
  
    ruined
  
   it!
  ”
 
      
  “
  Ruined it? RUINED IT!? Big talk coming from someone like 
  
    you
  
  , -
  ”
 
      
  “
  Watanabe?~
  ”, interrupted INA, shrugging. Maybe some things really didn’t change.
 
      
  “
  NNNO!!
  ”
   Miku plunged the light blade right through INA, smack dab into his stomach!
 
  
    PLLLIIIII!!
  
 
  500!
 
      
  Despite this would-be fatal damage, INA seemed unfazed by this, not even wincing. He followed suit with a counterattack of his own!
 
      
  “
  Too slow, twintails!
  ” The saw dug into Miku’s arm!
 
  
    BRSCHWWWRRR!
  
 
  1,200!
 
      
  “
  You 
  
    bitch
  
  !
  ”, spat Miku, as INA to the ground, curb-stomping repeatedly!
 
  201! 202! 199! 203!
   
 
  He raised T.A.M.S. high and prepared for a crushing attack, yet in his opening Miku fired a barrage of light bursts while downed! Striking INA , the bursts caused him to topple over and drop the saw!
 
  500!
 
      
  “
  Kyeha! Seems that 
  
    you’re
  
   the one who’s ‘too slow’ after all, bitch!”, sneered Miku, assuming attack stance. “Now that you’re defenseless, there’s no way for you to fight back!
  ” She prepared for another light slash.
 
      
  “
  Gyhyhyheee…
  ” 
 
  “
  What’s so funny, corcy!?
  ” Miku paused for a moment, a near fatal mistake. INA slowly picked himself back up, as he muttered the phrase “
  >‘defenseless’.
 
      
  “
  How the FUCK do you pronouce ‘>’?
  ” 
 
  INA pulled out his Drive with a clunky mockery of the Cryptloids’ usual finesse. He pulled out a glaive! How long had he had a Drive on him!?
 
  “
  Oh, kinda like ‘→’, but with a bit less nuance around the pointy bit.
  ” Orange energy had gathered around the tip of the glaive as INA pointed it deadset at Miku. 
 
  “
  Anyways, twintails, it’s been fun playing with ya, but unfortunately for you it’s time to 
  
    die!
  
  ”
 
  A shockwave rocketed forth from the tip of his glaive!
 
  “
  KWA-
  ” Miku had braced herself for an attack, but even with her wing boosters engaged, the force knocked Miku head over heels across the hallway, right into the wall!
 
  BTHUNK!
  
    
    
  

  1,400!
   
 
  “
  Gyaaa!
  ”
 
      
  “
  And now to get 
  
    this 
  
  back.
  ” INA picked up T.A.M.S. in his off hand. “
  That’s right motherfuckers, we’re 
  
    dual wielding!
  
  ”
 
   How scandalous!
 
      
  Miku had dusted herself off at this point and gotten back on her feet… save for how those hovering several inches off of the floor at this point.
 
  “
  You bitch! You can’t do that, that’s illegal!
  ”, cried Miku.

      

  “
  PHAH! What’re you going to do, call the cops?
  ”
 
  “
  ...Maybe I will.
  ” “
  Do it bitch, you won’t!
  ”
 
  “
  And by ‘call the cops’, I mean ‘beat the shit out of you’. Even degenerates like you don’t deserve the wrath of the p*gs.
  ”
 
  “
  We’re trying to kill each other, and you put 
  
    politics
  
   into it? Fucking crin-
  ”
 
  “
  YAKAMASHII!!
  ” With two blades of light drawn, Miku rocketed forward!
 
      
  INA got on the defensive as the two went head-to-head!
 
      
  Miku jabbed and sliced with the blades of light, and yet INA read all of her attacks! The twisted grin on INA’s face flared up as he threw an underhanded jab with his glaive at his combatant!
 
      
  “
  USELESS, USELESS, USELESS!!
  ”, INA chanted as he jabbed the glaive into her gullet!
 
      
  400!
 
      
  “
  Useless!?
  ”, 
  spat Miku, knocking the glaive to the floor with her light-blades.
 
      
  
    CLI-CLINK!!
  
 
  “
  ‘Useless?’ Are you serious with that? I’m not the fat lump who took four months just to change an engine on a damn chainsaw… I think YOU’RE the useless one around here… Or maybe, that’s supposed to be one of your stupid-ass ‘Joe Joe’ Refere-
  ”
 
  Trash-talking had gotten Miku nowhere, as INA, charged berserkly with T.A.M.S..
 
      
  “
  ARYIAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!
  ” He seemed ready to tear Miku’s head right off. Miku closed her eyes as she braced for the worst!

  Meanwhile, a bit of a ways from the murder attempt…

  Eli took one look back at the house before speaking up. 
 
  “
  We’re far enough away now. I think it’s time for you two to go as far as you can from here. Things are bound to only get worse from here.
  ”
 “Where the heck are we supposed to go?”asked Stacy, “I’ve spent umpteen years in that house raising my family there, and now I have to abandon all of that?!” 
  “
  Even if we were to take down INA, worse things could befall your family. It isn’t safe for you to remain here.
  ”
 
  “
  
    And why would that be?
  
  ” 
 
  “
  Michelle, or Miku, rather, has 
  
    multiple
  
   enemies. As of recent months, they have been conspiring together in order to take Miku down once and for all. It’s unknown to us what they stand to gain out of it, although INA… erm, how do I put this
  ”
 
  “
  
    What about him…?”
  
 
  “
  INA in particular seems to be doing this for particularly 
  
    hygy
  
   reasons…
  ”
 
  “
  
    he what”
  
   
 
  “
  Now in terms of where to go, Bath County is one of the remote areas in all of Virginia, and I’ve heard the weather is excellent this part of the year…
  ”
 
  “
  
    And we’re supposed to hike all the way out there!?”
  
  , cried Stacy.
 
  “
  Are we going to take a bath?
  ”, asked Verde.
 
  “
  It doesn’t matter where you end up, just far enough away from here that the consequences of today won’t get to you! Miku and the others will attempt to make amends with your household after this debacle ends. Now, please, go!
  ”
 
  Eli sent the begrudging two off on their merry civilian ways, and attempted to make her own way back into the house to assist Miku. However, unfortunately for Eli, she felt a sinister presence approaching her. 
 
  Eli drew her Drive and searched the area.
 
  “
  Who goes there!?”
 
  The dark presence felt stronger in the direction of a nearby storm drain.
 
   “I swear, 
  
    Teto,
  
   if you’re in there I’ll-
  ”
 
  An 
  
    extremely
  
   familiar-looking purple-haired head popped out of the drain cover. 
 
  The two stared at each other in disbelief.
 
  “
  ...Eli-cchi?
  ”

  “
  ...Nozomi?!
  ”
 
  Nozomi Tojo hopped out of the storm drain, overjoyed at the sight of her partner. For whatever reason, Nozomi was equipped in Full Idol gear, from the “Fresh Fruit Parlor” set, clashing heavily with Eli’s clothes bought long ago at her “date” at Potomac Mills. 

  
  
  

      
  The two were overcome with emotions and came in for a hug! (Probably not a good idea if Nozomi was just in a sewer, but the thought did not occur to them at the time.)
 
      
  Through tears, Eli cried out “
  You really were here!
  ”.
 
   Nozomi looked longingly at Eli. “
  And there’s nowhere else I’d rather be.
  ”
 
      
  On the street corner, Juju Xenoblade was T-posing aggressively.
 
  “i am in the cutscean”, Juju screamed 
  
    powerfully
  
   into the void.
 
      
  “
  GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE, WE’RE HAVING A GAY MOMENT!
  ”, Nozomi hollered with more animosity than when Nico refused to study. 
 
      
  Juju looked scornfully at the school idol lesbians before huffing off, but not before managing to mutter “dick”.
 
      
  “
  You’re the first sane person I’ve seen here in 
  
    months
  
  ,” said Eli, putting aside the fact that her partner had emerged from a sewer in full idol gear, “Why is everyone around here so 
  
    weird?!
  
  ”
 
      
  “
  Now, now, Eli-cchi. It’s not nice to talk about Americans like that. They can’t help but be fat and ugly!
  ”
 
      
  “
  No, as in, not only is this 
  
    continent not
  
   our home, but it’s almost as if this entire 
  
    dimension
  
   isn’t our home.
  ”
 
      
  “
  I see, I see. It’s been confusing for me as well. But worry not, Eli-cchi!
  ”
 
      
  “
  Why 
  
    shouldn’t
  
   we worry? None of our friends are here, and we’re regarded as 
  
    fictional!
  
  ”
 
      
  “
  On the contrary: we have nothing to tie us down. If we put our heads together, we could ditch 
  
    both sides
  
   of this petty turf war, and spend the rest of our days together.
  ”
 
      
  “
  R-really?!
  ” 
 
  Something about this just didn’t add up. Now that she had a closer look at her partner, something seemed awfully… 
  
    orange
  
   about Nozomi today… 
 
      
  “
  Of course! It seems that after all, 
  
    THIS
  
   is our world without Nico!
  ”
 
      
  “
  But Nozomi, that would mean that... That…
  ”
 
      
  “
  Yes, Eli-cchi. We’ll move far, far away from here, and we’ll finally be able to open our parfait shop. Together.
  ” 
 
  “
  Together.
  ”, affirmed Eli.
     “But before we do any of that, there’s just one teensy, weensy thing I need ya to do for me.” Nozomi seemed upset about something. 
      
  “
  What? What is it?!
  ”, pleaded Eli, only to be met with a thousand-yard stare.
 
      
  “
  Eli-cchi. 
  I need you to kill Miku Hatsune with me
  .
  ” You could almost hear the record scratch.
 
      
  “
  You w h a t
  ” 
 
  “
  The Diamond is necessary in 
  
    our
  
   plans, Eli-cchi. Miku must fall.
  ” 
 
      
  “
  Nozomi, I…
  ” “
  Do you think we’re simply too weak to face Miku? The Cards have already forecasted great success on our part. Upright Wheel, Upright Chariot, and Upright World. We 
  
    cannot
  
   lose this battle.
  ”
 
  “
  Have you lost it?!
  ” “
  Lost it? LOST IT!? Eli-cchi, I’ve been the only one to ever 
  
    have it
  
  ! You never want to do ANYTHING! You didn’t want to become Student Council President, you wouldn’t let Honoka form her club, and you said you would never be an idol! All you have done is 
  
    deny
  
   my advice, claiming that you always know best. ‘Cute and Clever Elichika’... Hah! We both know that’s wrong with that. If you had 
  
    never
  
   listened to me, you would have ended your high school years as an overhyped exchange student!
  ”
 
  “
  I think there’s a big step in between becoming a school idol and 
  
    killing a goddess
  
  !
  ”
 
  “
  It will be accomplished all the same, Eli-cchi.
  ” Nozomi pulled out her scythe!
 
  “
  Nozomi, you're scaring me ...
  ” 
 
  “
  Then you ought to butt out of this. Like that weird brown-haired kid.
  ”
 
      
  With her sights only set on Miku, Nozomi steamrolled Eli, punting her to the ground with the weapon’s handle, and then hitting the off switch! 
 
  How rude! 
 
  Nozomi threw the deactivated neso into a ditch!
 
  “
  Y
  
    eet!
  
  ”
 
  With that, Nozomi stamped off towards the COOL IT!!! Household. She had a diamond to get. 

  Back to the murder!

  INA screamed like a madman as he charged forward for his finishing attack!
 
  “
  ARYIAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!
  ”
 
  Miku braced for the worst, but fortunately for her, INA tripped on a conveniently-left-behind empty bag of Bob Soft Mints™. Truly, Miku’s addiction had upholded itself.
 
      
  “
  
    GYIIIH
  
  !
  ”, INA screeched as he was sent stumbling. He missed his mark, and sliced off one of Miku’s trademark twintails!
 
  Miss! (at least physically)
 
      
  After the realization that INA had missed his pompous attack, Miku opened her eyes. INA had landed directly on her.
 
      
  The two combatants were definitely 
  
    not
  
   socially distancing, and it’s best to leave it at that. There’s already enough sexual tension in this scene.

  INA looked just as dumbfounded as she was. His awkwardly log rolling off, combined with an expression that can only be described as “ :| ”, indicated that he had not expected things to go this way. 
 
      
  But now was the time for Miku to 
  
    strike back!
  
   Picking herself up. the only noise in the room was the left harclip clattering to the ground. (INA, of course, was still awkwardly rolling away, but he had since left the upper hallway and clattered down the stairs with a “C-thunk-A-thunk” sound.)
 
      
  Miku saw the discarded T.A.M.S. on the ground, laced by strands of the severed teal twintail. She knew what had to be done.
 
      
  The Anti-Miku Saw would no longer be “Anti-Miku”. She was the one holding it now, after all. She peered into the Core-powered engine.
 
      
  “
  Meiko, Kaito, Luka, Rin, Len… I’ve failed all of you… 
 
  but I’m not about to fail 
  
    myself!!
  
  ”
 
      
  Two more sets of booster wings erupted from her back, as both the hair clip on the floor and the remaining hair clip fizzled away! Her hair and eyes turned from teal to almost white, as well as the CV-01 tattoo! Light energy filled the area around her!
 
      
  In bright multicolored text, the phrase “
  POWER LIMITING HAIR CLIPS OFFLINE, OVERCLOCK PROTOCOL ENGAGED
  ” emblazoned her HUD.
 
      
  Miku had entered her Overclocked Form!
 
      
  “
  It’s time that INA learns when you mess with the ‘do, you get the pew pew!!
  ”
 
      
  She crashed through the upper floor of the house, tearing through the floor with the saw!
 
      
  INA was still rolling around. Missing that attack had emotionally struck deep inside of him. 
 
      
  “
  (So. This is what 
  
    regret
  
   feels like… I’ve lost the saw, too.)
  ” 
 
      
  As unawkwardly as one possessing another’s body could do, INA picked himself off of the floor somewhere in the entry hall.
 
      
  “
  No matter. I still have my Drive, and the Kinkshamer Supreme has been weakened.”, he muttered to himself. “Backup will arrive shortly. If I hold out for a little longer, then-
  ”
 
      
  “
  Awfully bold of you to think that, INA.
  ”
 
      
  “
  GEH!?
  ”
 
      
  Miku was standing… er, levitating, at the other end of the hall, by the rarely-used dining room. Understandably, she seemed unhappy about something. She also apparently got a haircut in a minute and a half, dyed and all, and had more wings than usual. What a makeover!
     “Alright, you’ve lived long enough.” She held up the chainsaw, as INA stumbled forward, his glaive glowing and ripe for another knockback attack! 
      
  “
  This bitch empty!
  ” Miku triumphantly cried out. “
  YEET!
  ” She chucked the saw at INA>
 
      
  The saw impacted INA right in the gut, resoundly knocking him over.
 
      
  521!
 
      
  “
  GWUAH!
  ”
 
      
  “
  Aw fuck,
  ” INA whimpered as the glaive clattered to the floor. “
  I can’t believe you’ve done this.
  ” 
 
      
  “
  And now, to finish this!
  ” Miku rose up further, as she spread her arms out wide! She was going to T-Pose to Assert Dominance! 
 
      
  However, the greenish beams of light erupting from all over her body told a different story.
 
      
  “
  ...And now to finish this! Luminaire, Loose!!
  ”
 
      
  “
  Is she reall-
  ” 
 
  500!!
 
  It’s a critical hit!
 
  Ian
   returned to normal.
 
  Ian got hurt and collapsed...
 
  An enormous fireball of holy light engulfed not only the house, but the entire block! 
 
  The bubble of light tore through the neighborhood, vaporizing anything that dared to stand in its path! Homes blasted away, cars tossed like childrens’ toys, and every tree branch and blade of grass was scorched to oblivion! Everything within a few hundred meters of Miku was leveled! Truly, the evil had 
  
    finally
  
   been defeated… Hopefully… 

  
  

      
  It was rather unfortunate what had to happen to Eli, but alas, sometimes in life, sacrifices have to be made. Sure, Nozomi was never fond of the Utau. Especially after keeping her in a cage for being branded as “some kind of hygy, titty-grabbing maniac”. 
 
      
  Deep within the dark basement, Nozomi’s hatred of her three captors stewed. They treated her like an animal, like a toy… But there seemed to be something out there that actually
  
     wanted
  
   her. She thought it was Eli at first, but this entity that appeared in the house every week or so seemed a bit too orange to be Eli. 
  
    This 
  
  was something else entirely.
 
   The Cards had spoken: Reverse Devil, Upright Tower, and Upright Emperor. This orange entity was going to bring about something new, whether the world was ready for it or not. And Nozomi was going hop onto that bandwagon. She would become part of the change.
 
      
  Strange teal lights flickered inside of the target house.
 
      
  “
  Miku must be there. This should be easy.
  ”
 
      
  Sadly, it was 
  
    not
  
   going to be easy.
 
      
  The lights intensified to a bright white, as they kept getting brighter and brighter. Nozomi asked herself if the house was going to blow, but she didn’t need the cards to find out that the answer was undoubtedly “yes.”
 
      
  She panicked, grabbing the deactivated Eli from the concrete-lined ditch. Using her abilities, Nozomi dragged the two of them into a darkened drainage pipe!
 
      
  Deep in the shadows, it was always deathly silent. Today, however, seemed to be an exception to that, as a low rumbling could be heard. The shadows themselves seemed to lighten as the rumbling ensued. Some power was affecting them! As quick as the disturbance had arrived, it had stopped.
 
      
  It was safe to emerge. What Nozomi hadn’t expected, however, was what the neighborhood would look like after she did. 
 
      
  The whole block was flattened, patio furniture and cars were burnt out and thrown about and smallish fires were eating away at the remnants of various houses. The only things remaining intact were the asphalt of the road and the concrete foundations, ditches, and pipes.
 
      
  “
  What… happened here?
  ” 
 
      
  At the house on the end of the cul-de-sac, a teal-haired woman with long hair was kneeling beside a horribly burnt corpse.

  Kuwhehehehe… It seems that it really 
  
    has
  
   all been laid out for me… This will be like taking candy from a baby!

  Nozomi carefully set Eli back into the drainage pipe.
 
      
  “
  Stay there, okay? You’ll be safe in there, and besides, I don’t need you interfering in my

  With the last of her power used up by the Luminaire blast, Miku dropped to the ground. 

      

      
  All that was left of INA now was a crispy, crunchy, black-smutted mess.That mess was all that was left of 
  
    Ian
  
  , too. 
 
      
  “
  You fucker.”, blubbered Miku, “You absolute madman.
  ” Tears welled up in the Alpha Vocaloid’s eyes. She turned over the charred remains.
 
      
  “
  I always said being hygy would be the death of you. Now look at yourself, it really has been!
  ”
   
 
  “
  Thinking back, you were always a bit absent-minded. It’s no surprise that 
  
    they’d
  
   try and take advantage of you. But to take Teto’s bait… are you 
  
    that
  
   dumb? She’s completely untrustworthy, yet all it takes is the mere suggestion of anime tiddies for you, and you then bow to her will…
  ” Miku attempted to collect herself.
 
  “
  Simp. That’s the only word for this. You’re a simp, Ian. I'm not sure if what you do to Eli can even be classified as simping, even though it is toxic nonetheless, but you sure simp for me; buying me shit and taking me out because you think the only way is that I’ll keep hanging out with you. Guess what? That’s not how you get people to like you. Worse, you simp for Teto, letting her take advantage of you until there’s nothing left to take advantage of. Why? Do you think she’ll be your friend?
  ” She sorrowfully knelt over All That Was Left Of Ian.
 “Well… She isn’t your friend. Never was, never will be, because… I-i’m your best friend!!” Miku had failed to collect herself at this point, and had thus resumed crying. 
  “
  A-and nothing’s ever gonna change that! Not Teto, not coronavirus, not climate change, not Xenoblade Chronicles 2, not even IB!! A-a-and don’t you ever for-

  “
  Enough with the heartfelt monologue, time for 
  
    PAIN!
  
   Kuhuhehe!!
  ”, a voice with a strange accent snickered.
 
  “
  Let go of me, you dip!
  ” Miku was being attacked from behind, and pinned in place under some sort of spell! Glancing back at her attacker, Miku was met with a figure with twintails much like her own, but tied lower down… and also purple. With piercing emerald eyes and a sinister grin, this person reminded Miku of Eli for some reason.
 
  She knew why.
 
  This was whom Eli had warned of, Toujou Nozomi! But this information was useless, as Miku was already caught in her trap. Nozomi giggled.
 
  “
  Kuhuha… You’re scared. TA
  
    ll
  
   the better!!
  ” A strange, lavender-colored energy swirled about as Nozomi groped harder!
 
  “
  You-you won’t be getting away with this!
  ”, Miku managed to cry out.
 
  “
  Ah, but that’s where you’re wrong, Mikucchi… 
  ” Everything fell unnaturally silent. “...
  I already have.
  ”
 
  “
  Washi washi suru yan…!
  ” A bolt of pain unlike any other rocketed through Miku’s body! Miku didn’t even have time to react before being knocked out!!
 
  8,000! 
  It’s a critical hit! It’s a One-Hit K-O!! 
 
  “
  
    Iii-yaah!!

  The world went dark around Miku.

  Soft, warm sunlight baked down on the back of Steve’s neck.
 
  “Ngaah…”, he mumbled, “Five more minutes…” 
 
  Only then it occurred to Steve that he was not in bed, but on grass. He rolled himself over, staring up into a clear blue sky that features square clouds and an equally square sun.
 
  Steve recognized this view, and bolted upright. He could see the untouched landscape that lay beyond him. Blocky hills with blocky trees, vast desert valleys and towering snowy peaks, and rivers, lakes, and oceans cutting in between, all with no other people as far as the eye could see.
 
  This was 
  
    Minecraft!
  
 
  Steve realized what had happened. 
 
  Before “Ena”, whatever Ian had turned into, had attacked him for the second time, “Ena” had been in the master bedroom. He had destroyed Steve’s bed, and if his bed was ever missing or obstructed…
 
  “I’d be sent back to World Spawn. …GOD 
  DAMMIT
  !!”
 
  With no armor, no tools, and no items, it was going to take a long time to get back home. But Steve had too. His daughter/CEO/magical girl superheroine was no doubt in grave danger!
 
      
  Steve would do anything if it meant helping her. Even if it meant undergoing the arduous, ten thousand block trek back to The Stronghold.
 
      
  With no time to waste, Steve picked himself up and started foraging for supplies. He walked up to the nearest tree, and punched at the trunk.
 
      
  He would need to get a crafting table before anything else.
 
  Back to the fun in Midlothian!

    TRRRM...
  
 
  Michelle woke up in her house to what sounded like distant thunder.
 
  “
  Forecast said it was supposed to be clear tonight…” Michelle mumbled, “My house? This was destroyed in the explosion!
  ” She tried taking a look around. It seemed that hours had passed, as everything was stained by the amber glow of dusk.
 
     “
  Mom? …
  ”
 
     “
  Dad…?
  ”
 
      
  “
  Verde?
  ”
 
  It felt like some sort of dream, as there was no sign of life other than her-- Earthling or otherwise. All That Was Left Of Ian wasn’t here, either.
 
   Rooms were empty, untouched even, in the same condition as right before INA showed up. There were no battle scars here. The candles on the cake were even still lit. 
 
  “
  Really don’t like that. Clearly, time HAS passed based on the sun, but if the house is somehow standing 
  
    again
  
  , then…
  ” Michelle tore into the half-bath and looked at the mirror.

  
  

      
  A gaping, half-healed cyan wound bored right through Michelle’s chest! On her back, there was a suspiciously-placed sticky note. She tore it off. It read:
 
      
  “
  
    Thanks for the Chaos Emerald, bitch! --Nozomi
  
  ”
 
      
  “
  Oh. You 
  
    bitch
  
  . You’re even worse than Ian.
  ” She crumpled up the sticky note.
 
      
  “
  Temporal restoration systems were activated. In an attempt to preserve what little was left of me, the whole neighborhood’s been rewound to an earlier state. At least we have confirmation now that it doesn’t affect living material.... I went down, Eli’s Rodolfo-knows-where after evacuating the fam, and now that little pink shit stain is gonna have all the cores.
  ”
 
      
  “
  Or is she even the one in charge now? INA said something about a ‘master plan’, surely that must mean he’s calling the shots. Why could he be after the cores? He’s clearly strong enough without them…
  ”
 
      
  Michelle paced back and forth in the kitchen, with only twilight and candlelight filling the lifeless house. She looked out one of the back windows. In the distance, a colossal pillar of orange light was slowly rising through the evening sky. By now, Michelle knew what the color orange meant. Maybe INA wasn’t so dead after all...
 
  “
  Doesn’t matter, I need to kick
  
     his
  
   ass. Ugh! But, I can’t while I’m like this! I used up all my mint yesterday, recharging stations won’t exist on this planet for another twenty million years, and the closest backup 
  
    I
  
   have is currently on the other side of the galaxy… unless I go with 
  
    them

  “
  Pah! Even in emergencies like this, I’m not letting 
  
    those losers
  
   back on the team! You make fun of Rodolfo, you get ditched in the void until Heat Death. Them’s the rules.
  ”
 
  “
  So that means… Wait.
  ” An idea popped into Michelle’s head.
 
      
  “
  I still have 
  
    that
  
   thing, right?!
  ” She rushed upstairs to her room, and dove under her bed. She pulled out a smallish, teal coffer resembling a treasure chest.
 
      
  “
  Ahh… The organic Cores I was growing, in the scenario of one of us permadying. Gotta have life insurance.
  ” She popped open the coffer. A white, brilliant-cut (although less neatly) diamond several inches in diameter resided on the left of the container. An empty space occupied the slot in the left-center., with two more slots being dedicated to Cores that were still growing.
 
  “… That’s odd, case B is missing. Did someone take it? Couldn’t be. No one even knows about this chest but me. 
  Unless…
   Eh, whatever, A’s been in here long enough, it’s ready to serve its purpose.

  Michelle took the Second Diamond out of the Miku Chest.
 
  “
  In ya go!
  ” Miku slotted the Second Diamond into her wound. Her HUD popped up, with various alerts flashing. They all dropped one-by-one, and the whole panel turned from teal to white!
 
  “
  Didn’t think that’d go through on the first try…
  ” Miku powered up, wings and Drive engaged. Never had she held a leek with more determination. 
 
  “
  But first, some much needed equipment.
  ” Miku pulled out a small plastic card. It had a picture of her, and the caption “Orbit”. She slammed it into her left arm.
   
 
  
    Module equipped!
  
 
  Her hair turned from teal to seafoam green as she surged with energy! Her normal clothes gave way to a shiny, lilac-silver, star-shaped dress, surrounded by teal ribbons. Her square hair clips fizzled out in favor of a massive, cobalt blue headpiece with three white feathers sticking out of it. The normally slate gray cuffs became a similar shade of white.
 
  “
  
    I’m the Precure now.
  
  ” Miku turned to the window.
 
  “
  I’m gonna eat Bob Soft Mint and beat the shit out of UTAUs, and I’m 
  
    all out of Bob Soft Mint
  
  .
  ” 
 
  Miku rocketed off, crashing through the window! Opening windows was for nerds! From cruising altitude, it was fairly obvious where to go from here. In the distance, a colossal pillar of orange light stretched from the ground to as far up as the eye could see.
 The Finale lay at the base of that pillar of light, somewhere around the Southlake Office Park by the looks of it. 
  “
  That’s awfully strange… Why has he set up base there…?
  ”, Miku thought while at cruising altitude.
 
  It then, crushingly, hit her 
  
    where
  
   the beam was coming from. 
 
  Richmond Ice Zone.
 
  This was meant to be an attack on her image. That was going to be unforgivable. 
 
  It was time to kick INA's ass... Again.

  ACT IX - His Name is INA

  A very square place indeed

  “GOOD MORNING, 
  
    MIDLOTHIAN!!
  
  ”, exclaimed Ian as he jolted awake. He attempted to yeet himself out of bed, but to his horror found that he had been thrashing about in sand.
 
  “Sand… This isn’t my bedroom!” Ian exclaimed as rolled over. An endless expanse of blue laid above him, smeared with pillowy, rectangular clouds and topped off with an equally square sun. Below lay a sea of sand that stretched horizon to horizon, with intermittent cacti and shrubs sprinkled throughout. A vast (and rather voxelated) mountain range towered in the south.
 
  “This can’t be…” Ian sat up, and was met face-to-face with an equally blocky tan rabbit. It skittered off into the vast wastes of the desert around him. Of course, it was common knowledge that if you died in real life, you went to Minecraft, but when you died in Minecraft, you died 
  
    forever
  
  .
 
  “What happened? Oh, right. I died, I think.” Ian stood up and dusted himself off, deciding to head towards the mountains. Night would come sooner than later, and Ian didn’t want to be caught in the middle of a horde of hungry Husks.
 
  “So, Rin got BTFO’d, then Len understandably wasn’t too happy about that, and nae nae’d me… Why doesn’t my head still hurt? From the look of the last two frames of existence I saw blacked out, it looked pretty messy.” He trudged onward for what seemed like hours through the sand, breaking a few dead bushes along the way out of habit.
 
  “At least I’ve got sticks now.”, he muttered to no one in particular, “Huh… Guess Michelle was right. We 
  
    do
  
   go to Minecraft after we die… Do we die forever after we die in Minecraft, too? Or would I end up in Terraria…? More importantly, is there any way to get back, or am I in Minecraft forever? That is… assuming I can make it out of this desert.”
 
  A thunking sound broke the steady pattern of Ian’s movement in the sand. He looked down. He wasn’t standing on sand anymore, he was standing on 
  
    sandstone
  
  . 
 
  “Ah. A sign of civilization? But there’s no lighting around this trail.”
 
  A path lay to both sides of him. To his right, the path led to a large, flat, blueness that covered the horizon. Ian reasoned that that was probably an ocean. To his right, the path led up into the mountains, with the top of a sandstone structure peeking out above the ridge.
 
  “A desert temple? Hey, even if it’s been looted, that’s a place for me to hole up in! Anything to keep the mobs out…”
 
  It was best for Ian to head to his left. The sandstone bath gave way to sandstone stairs. Stairs were never pleasant for Ian, but the desert heat here made it much worse.
 
  “It’ll be worth it,” he groaned, “just think of the four chests…!” 
 
  After some time, Ian summited the peaks. To his amazement, the sandstone structure was, in fact, no 
  
    pyramid
  
  . By the looks of it, this was a 
  
    mansion!
  
   In the middle of this desert, this structure stood out like an ornate oasis, complete with gardens in the back, a spot of stone gray and brown-green grass in this sandy sea. The mansion seemed to be three floors high, like the ones the Illagers build in Dark Forests. The exterior walls were graced with columns of smooth sandstone and sandstone stairs, with glowstone blocks set near the bottom of the columns. Massive windows carved into the walls in between the columns.
 
  “Welp… Time to break and enter. I mean, I just spawned today. Surely, the dude who owns it will cut me some slack… at the very least, they’ll get me out of the desert.” 
 
  The hike down the ridge wasn’t as long as the hike up, due to a combination of gravity helping rather than hindering, and that this mansion lay in a valley high above sea level.

  Ian arrived at the front doors and gave them a knock. Astoundingly, the birch door snapped open after a single knock.
 
  “(Does this mean I’m invited in…?)”
 
  If the outdoor exterior was fancy, then the interior was positively 
  
    divine
  
  . The water features, glowstone covered by oak trapdoors, and “houseplants” (really just two leaves and a fencepost) all added up to create a pleasant experience.
 
   A massive staircase lay before him, but Ian decided to not climb up. At the top of the stairs, Ian saw a massive mosaic of various logos he couldn’t discern from the bottom. To the left resided a vast dining room, no doubt there was a kitchen near that -- chock-full of food, too! He thought about those two options briefly, but then found a hallway to the right, and walked down it. He opened the door to the first room in the hall.
 
  “Uh, h-hello, I-” There wasn’t anybody here, which was sort of a relief. What there 
  
    was
  
  , however, were a bunch of really old toys and Japanese playing cards. Ian wondered what they had to do with each other, but whatever they were, they sure weren’t native to Minecraft.
 
  The next room featured old arcade cabinets. Ian recognized a few of them, but at the far end of the room was a machine for “Donkey Kong”. Ian thought the attention to this was rather odd. He would’ve played on a few of the machines, but alas, he had no quarters on him.
 
  The room after that was lined wall-to-wall on both sides with Nintendo Entertainment System games. At the far end of the room lay two old CRT TVs, one hooked up with an N.E.S., and the other hooked up with a Famicom. Below the TVs, bins were filled with bulky and unnecessary accessories meant for 8-bit games of a bygone era. Ian pressed on.
 
      
  The next room could only be described as a “Super” version of the previous one. The two consoles were replaced by their successors, the Super Nintendo and the Super Famicom. The games were likewise from the next generation, and the accessories were (thankfully) much fewer in number. Ian began to notice a pattern about the rooms in this manor.
 
      
  The rooms were all Nintendo-themed! The first one was pre-video games, the second was Arcade, the third 8-bit, and now 
  
    16-bit!
  
   The rooms that followed continued with console theming: A Gameboy/Color room, A Virtual Boy room, an N64 room, a GameCube room, a Gameboy Advance room, a Nintendo DS/i room, a Wii room (Ian’s favorite), and a 3DS room. Ian came upon a door blocked off with police tape. 
 
      
  “Ah, yes. That must be the Wii U’s room.” He decided it was best not to endter not to enter.
 
      
  “(Damn. This is like a whole museum!! How’d it get into Minecraft? Is there some kind of corporate deal between Mojang and Nintendo? Michelle, er, 
  
    Miku
  
  , is the CEO of Minecraft or something, right? Maybe she’d know… But she isn’t here, and that’s partially my fault. Ah well, no going back now. Time for the Switch! If that’s the most recent one, maybe someone’s in there that can give me directions outta here!)”
 
      
  Per his prediction, this room 
  
    was
  
   occupied. 
 
      
  
    “Of cooooooourse I can fly, Willow! No, you can’t see it, because it doesn’t work when other people are watching!

  A man in a multicolored squid hat was sitting down on the couch, playing 
  
    Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX
  
  , surrounded by notebooks, microphones, and other recording equipment. He paused the game, and slowly turned around. 
 
      
  Ian felt parylyzed as the strange man stared him down, the eyes on his Squid Hat tracking his movement. The man stood up, brushing the microphones aside, and with a smile on his face, did the Hiker Dance!

  Ian was elated as he joined along, truly, the greeted pride of all, yet the feeling stopped cold when the man finished his dance.
 
      
  HE spoke:
 
      
  “
  Hey Everybody, It’s Chuggaaconroy, now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, why the fuck are you in my house!?
  ”
 
      
  Emilano RODOLFO “Chuggaaconroy” Rosales-Birou 
  
    was 
  
  real (and he lived in Minecraft)!! Ian was utterly petrified! 
 
  “I-I-I dunno man, I just got here, I dunno why I’m in Minecraft, or why ya go here after you die and-”, Ian squeaked out with his back against the door, but was interrupted by RODOLFO Himself.
 
  “
  SILENCE! That was a trick question, 
  
    I already know why you’re here
  
  . The eyes on my squid hat see all.
  ”
 
  “G-great, then w-we can c-cut to the chase”, Ian could barely manage to cobble together his words as the all-seeing eyes of RODOLFO’s Squid Hat pierced his very soul.

  “
  SILENCE! You shall not return to the mortal coil so easily. Do not mistake my customary Hiker Dance for rapport, 
  
    hygy
  
  .
  ” 
 
  “B-!”
 
  “
  SILENCE! You may not have disturbed my collection of games, but by no means does that mean that you are free of SIN. Normally, I’d have you sent off to the Soul Sand Valley, but unfortunately there exists a… complication.
  ”
 
  “(...?)” Ian managed to look up and stare directly into the squid hat’s eyes. Bad idea! A surge of pain shot through his body, and Ian recoiled! RODOLFO spoke:
 
  “
  Yeah, mortals aren’t supposed to do that… ‘Losing one’s grasp of reality’, yadda yadda, other things Lovecraft wrote about. Getting to the matter at hand, you are close with the one known as ‘Miku’, correct? That’s the complication.
  ”
 
  “...H-How? What the hell does she have to do with any of this!?” Ian seemed flustered, the intimidation lightening up.
 
  “
  ...You do realize she’s the CEO of Minecraft, right?
  ”
 
  “Isn’t she in high school?”
  “Yes, Miku, or ‘Michelle’, as you refer to her, is in high school. She’s also the CEO of Minecraft… and Domino's… and C.F.M.….” 
  “And yet with all that goin’ on, she still finds the time to watch The Pokémon Anime for hours a day…” 
 
      
  “
  Ignoring that comment… As the CEO of Minecraft, Miku technically 
  
    owns
  
   this property… or any build in Minecraft, for that matter. If I stick you in a Soul Sand Valley for good, she’ll probably make the rent shoot up, and that would be getting off 
  
    lightly
  
  . It was hellish enough getting all of those games in one place, I don’t even want to consider having to 
  
    move
  
  …
  ”, RODOLFO mumbled in a dreary manner, the seeming opposite of normal Let’s Play image.
 
  “You can’t send me to hell because Miku will kick ya outta your house?”, Ian asked deadpanned.
 
  “
  Alas, the shackles of capitalism even hold down the gods themselves… But if I can’t banish you there is something I 
  
    can
  
   do, oh ho ho ho hohohoho!!
  ”
 
   The divine intimidation resumed over full force! The tentacles on RODOLFO’s hat began to move, as the Switch Room faded into blackness.

  Ian couldn’t speak. Nor could he move. He was stuck in the void, with only RODOLFO to judge him. It was like sleep paralysis stories he had heard on Reddit, but magnitudes worse.

  
    
  
      
  “
  I’m gonna 
  
    yell 
  
  at you.
  ” RODOLFO was about to tear Ian a new asshole -- quite possibly in the literal sense, given how His hat-tentacles writhed.

  
  

  “
  Oh, what’s that, Ian? You’re thinking ‘Haha, you fool, I’m too used to being yelled at by my parents for it to accomplish anything!’? Holy haircut, it seems that 
  
    you
  
  , and I must clarify, NOT WATANABE, are the fool! Your treatment of that sentient doll has not gone unnoticed! Yes. Night after night of you laughing her issues off, casting her to the side. Eli’s not just an object, you know. She has feelings. None of them are for you. Will you ever understand it? No, because you are a pathetic excuse for a man.
 
  The target of said feelings is the second of those sentient dolls. Nozomi Tojo, the one that you regard as a monster. Why is that? Yes, it is rather uncanny that she can cripple her enemies with a mere touch to the breasts, but there are logical steps in between that and ‘Nozomi is scary’! Did you not think there could be more to her? NO! You KNEW she was being held against her will, and was built to become a mindless killing machine, and yet you do nothing. Why is that? Did you think she would ‘steal’ Eli from you? Are you afraid of being cucked
  
     that badly?
  
 
  Ian. It’s not stealing if it never belonged to you in the first place. You knew the two third-years are meant to be a couple. You’ve listened to ‘Garasu no Hanazono.’ And yet, you were also perfectly complacent with going along with that drill-headed freak’s scheme from the get-go, despite KNOWING deep down in your heart that it was wrong. What do you stand to gain out of this? 
 
  Your life has fallen apart. Almost all of your friends stopped talking to you when they realized something was happening. The only people you talk to are either trying to use you, or are only around you because they’re forced to be. In your family’s case, it seems that they are no longer in the latter case and have abandoned you entirely. The only person left in your life is Miku, and under her adversaries’ orders, you ‘have’ to destroy her. It’s Teto’s fault, right? She’s who's REALLY to blame!
 
  But it was never her’s or anyone else’s orders to begin with. This was your doing from the start. You CHOSE to accept Teto’s offer. You CHOSE to help out in the scuffle with Meiko. You chose not to leave after Kaito attacked, and you realized what you had gotten into. You CHOSE to meet with Neru and create the saw. You CHOSE not to set Eli and Nozomi free when you had the chance. You CHOSE to stick around in your own home when the shit hit the fan, and thus, you paid the ultimate price. You have been reduced to a mere husk that shall endlessly wander a waste of blocks. 
 
  Like any good parent, I must say, I’m more disappointed than I am mad. You have been a loyal subscriber for years now, even longer than you have known Miku. You have done well to spread the gospel of Let’s Plays, Hiker Dancing, and So-Bad-They’re-Good Puns. That, combined with how my landlord would throw an absolute FIT if anything unfortunate happened to you because of me, has led me to this.
 
  I shall give you a second chance.
 
  DO NOT TAKE IT LIGHTLY!
 
  First, you must be reprimanded for your sins!” THE LORD produced an oversized codfish.

  “I’m gonna slap you with a fish for each of your sins.” Ian could say nothing. He could do nothing, nothing except receive the fish slap.
 “For your pride, thinking that you should have been exempt from the consequences of your actions.” SHLAPP!! It was scaly. 
  “
  For your wrath, having put your brother and mother, whom I may remind you,
  
     love you more than anything else in the world
  
  , under the crosshairs of a biomechanical menace from beyond the stars.
  ” 
  
    SHLAPP!!
  
   It was foul.
 “For your sloth,  having simply swept all of your skeletons into the closet and watching the days go by as things got worse and worse.” SHLAPP!! It was wet. 
  “
  For your greed, having secretly stolen from others, wicked they may be. Two wrongs do not make a right, Ian.
  ” 
  
    SHLAPP!!
  
   It was stinky.
 “For your gluttony…” THE LORD glanced downwards, at Ian’s beer belly. “I think this one is self-explanatory. You shouldn’t be drinking that much soda, even if it is zero-calorie!” SHLAPP!! It was bony. 
  “
  For your envy, having looked to those 
  
    far, far
  
   above your caliber -- above 
  
    any
  
   of your kind, for that matter -- and demanding yourself to be placed among them.
  ” 
  
    SHLAPP!!
  
   It was slippery.
 
  “
  For your lust… You know what, we 
  
    both
  
   know what you’re guilty of here, and it’s best to leave it at that.
  ” 
  
    SHLAPP!!
  
   It was 
  
    slimy.
  
 
  “
  Lastly, your blasphemy. You, a supposed 
  
    ‘long-time fan’
  
   know that it is the RIGHT ARM that is swung to and fro during the Hiker Dance, yet here you are, 
  
    in my own abode no less
  
  , doing it with your LEFT!?!
  ” 
  
    SHLAPPP!!
  
   This one was extra hard. It was cold.
 
  “
  Now that that’s though, 
  
    this
  
   is no ‘Get-out-of-jail-free card’, nonono. You must repent. Repent your hygy ways! Use this chance to apologize to those who need it most, and to make the amends that you need to. Simply buying a copy of ‘Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition’ and calling it a day will not be enough. You need, for once in your life, to do what is 
  
    right
  
  . Repel the darkness from within your own heart, and seal it away forever more! And then 
  
    maybe
  
   I’ll give you a pun.
  ”
 
  Ian felt like he was able to speak again. The void seemed less intimidating, but the Lord was still piercing through his very soul
 
  “Y-yes, Lord RODOLFO.”
 
  “
  You must be the change.
  ” 
 
  “Yes, Lord RODOLFO.”
 
  “You must watch TheRunawayGuys Colosseum 2021.”
 
  “
  Yes, … wait, what?
  ”
 
  “Now, go, venture forth and set things straight! And subscribe to TheRunawayGuys!”
 
  “
  Words cannot thank you, O Lord RODOLFO!
  ” The two floated awkwardly in the void, but not for long. The “normal” mansion filtered back into “reality”. 
 
  “
  Oh… says here your body is ‘currently occupied’. But your very soul is here before me, is it not?
  ” RODOLFO seemed to be staring at something invisible to Ian. The God of Puns recoiled in reaction to something, shouting:
 
  
    “What the fuck is an ‘INA’!?”

  The Hyper Gate, used long ago by the Cryptloids to travel thousands of light years in mere instants, lay scattered in pieces in the skating rink’s parking lot. Teto had previously said it was “reassembled”, but Neru had begged to differ. As the UTAUloid finished her preparations on the eldritch device, she pushed some of the fragments into a ring around the main machine. Neru was on guard, “in case of bystanders noticing”, but it was after normal business hours, so the whole office park was going to be dead anyways. Haku, as per usual, was late, up to Rodolfo-knows-what. Neru surmised that she was still trying to get over her hangover. 
 
  The Boukas’, and by an extent, all of the Cryptloids, only ticket home was to be used as some sort of ethereal conduit? Teto’s “evil plans” were often ridiculous, to say least, but this!? None of this made any sense! Neru finally piped up.
 
  “
  Teto, are you 
  
    really
  
   sure this is gonna work?,” asked Neru, “The whole… portal to hell thing?
  ”
 
  “
  Why, of course, Neru,” Teto smirked, “this is all per Uta and Momo’s design! Why would I 
  
    ever
  
   lie to you about anything regarding villainy!?
  ” Teto had some kind of dopey grin today, different than her usual overly smug self. She mentioned her two “friends” that apparently worked for her. Neru wondered why she or Haku had never met these two individuals, but there were bigger priorities right now. 
 
  “
  Pretty sure you lied to us last time you had something big like this planned.
  ”
 
  “
  Oh ho ho ho! That’s where you’re wrong, kiddo, for today, 
  
    history 
  
  is about to be made!
  ”
 
  “
  ...’History’?”
 
  “
  As per Ian’s plan, this will be the first time we breach 
  
    dimensions
  
  . Notice the plural! Normally, our technology only goes as far as bending and breaking our own space-time. This will be the first time 
  
    anyone
  
  , in the history of our entire 
  
    universe
  
   will break into someone else’s space-time!
  ” Teto wasn’t even like this when the local bakery had a clearance sale!
 
  “
  ...And we’re going to use this to … what, make monster girls real?
  ”
 
  “
  Yes!!
  ”Teto barked.
 
  “
  You’re telling me we’re gonna go to a 
  
    parallel universe
  
  , and steal a bunch of titty demons!? Have you been damaged?
  ” Neru was dumbfounded.
 
  “
  Do you have a problem with that? I must say, my 
  
    associate
  
   won’t like anyone who does…
  ”
 “Your ‘associate’!? What the fuck are you talking about!?!” The Utau just stared off into space. “Teto!?!” 
  “
  Oh, look here she comes now!
  ” 
 
  A young woman with purple twintails came running through the park, carrying a bag with her. She had rather tacky-looking purple idol gear that matched her hair. Could this be…? 
 
  “
  OH, BY THE LET’S PLAY, DON’T TELL ME 
  
    THAT THING 
  
  IS-
  ” Fortunately, Nozomi interrupted.
 
  “
  Kasane, we have the Diamond.~
  ” Nozomi said with the same giddy disposition, what the hell were these two on!? (and who is their dealer) 
 
  “
  PERFECT!
  ”, Teto cried out, “
  But what of The Encyclopedia? He needs it for the  final stage of the activation.
  ”
 
      
  “
  He what!?
  ” “
  Don’t worry, it’’s in here, too.
  ” Neru was being left out… again!
 
  “
  But the Boss isn’t with you? Surely, the extraction went as planned?
  ”
 
  “
  Yeah, about that…
  ” Nozomi pulled up her inventory. Neru reacted with upset vehemence.
 
  “
  Since when did they have those!?
  ”, cried Neru.
 “What’s gotten you in a fuss? I put inventories on both of the M-class units.” Nozomi started pulling something out of the manifested screen.
  “
  Gagarin’s just too dumb to open hers up. She’s awfully proficient with that Drive of hers, but can’t even manage to find any of the other buttons! S
  
    o much for ‘Cute and Clever’!
  
   Ohohohoho!
  ”
 
  Neru caught sight of what Nozomi had. A two-meter lump of charcoal popped out of the inventory.
 
  “
  What… is that!?
  ”, spat Neru.
 
   “
  I think… that used to be Ian at some point
  ” ,Nozomi said, just a bit too casually. As she dragged the lump into the ring of machinery, she muttered something.
 
  “
  A point-blank Luminaire does that to a human… Miku was so burnt out after doing it, too, kehehe! She didn’t even see me coming behind her… oh, and what a fine-!” 
  Teto bitch-slapped Nozomi!
 
  25!

  “
  No horny!
  ” “
  Ow…
  ” 
 
  “
  At least, not yet… Oi! Neru! Make yourself useful, and get the Core Engine set up!
  ” Nozomi finished getting All That Was Left of Ian into place. What did 
  
    that
  
   have to do with tearing a dimensional breach?
 
  “
  ...So I’m not useful unless I’m following 
  
    your
  
   orders?
  ”, Neru growled.
 
  “
  They’re not 
  
    my
  
   orders, dweeb.
  ” Teto cracked the dopey smile. Something was definitely not right with her, at least, less right than usual. “
  I already 
  
    told
  
   you who they’re from. Besides, this isn’t the time for semantics! This is everything you’ve ever wanted, isn’t it Neru? Miku’s been defeated, and we’ll shine greater than she ever had before!!
  ” 
 
  Nozomi produced another item. The remnants of T.A.M.S.
 
  “
  For you, 
  
    Nerucchi
  
  .
  ” She tossed it over. “
  The first three are in there.
  ”
 
  “
  Uh, thanks…
  ” Even though the saw had been rendered non-operational in a Point-Blank Luminaire, the hatch to the engine still worked. After removing the Cores from the saw, another item was produced, a yellowish Core with a large seam down the middle. This one was maybe the size of an apricot, larger than the ones used to power T.A.M.S.
 
  “
  The fourth one,” nodded Nozomi.
   “
  Uh-huh.
  ” Neru opened up a panel on the Hyper Gate’s control frame and stuck the Cores in one-by-one.
 
  “
  And last but certainly not least,
  ” a teal, brilliant-cut diamond was produced, softball-sized in diameter. This was it. The trophy of their victory. 
  
    The
  
   Diamond. If Neru had a heart, it would have sunk at this moment..
 
  Nozomi hoisted it up!
 
  “
  Not so fast, Nerucchi!
  
     You gotta apologize!
  
  ”
 
  “
  FOR WHAT!?
  ”, Neru exasperatedly cried.

   

  “
  
    You still didn’t take back what you said about Eli-cchi.
  
  ”, she cried out through (fake) tears. 
 
  “
  ...Teto!?
  ” Teto seemed too busy with making some sort of marking on the ground to care.
 
      
  “
  Nozomi, no. Bad Idol. Do your job.
  ” Teto muttered quarter-heartedly. 
 
  Nozomi chucked The Diamond into the hatch and slammed the door closed! Upon hearing this, Teto skedaddled out of the ring, just after finishing her “painting.” It was a star-shape, with All That Was Left of Ian at the center. 
 
      
  “
  (Great… we’re doing pentagrams now. Haku isn’t missing anything worthwhile, then.)
  ”, Neru thought morosely, before being interrupted by the Dreaded Washi Fiend staring her down.
 
      
  “
  You don’t get to have it because you were mean to me.
  ”
 
  “
  ‘Mean to you’!? You literally groped me to the brink of death and tried to do the same to Haku and Ian…! Are you-
  ”
 
  Without breaking eye contact, Nozomi pulled a switch on the device, with a defiant and moderately pissed look on her face.
 
  “
  ...Insane? 
  
    Yes.
  
   Now, behold! He will soon arrive!
  ”
 
  The Hyper Gate whirred to life, as Neru looked onwards in horror!
 
  The pieces floated up into the air!

    BTHOOM!
  
 
      
  A scarlet beam shot from the mainframe, springing around the ring of pieces before slamming into the machine!
 
      
  
    BTHOOM!
  
 
      
  A royal blue beam followed suit! 
 
  Nozomi was still making that same damn grumpy expression all the while, as if this was specifically to spite Neru.
 
      
  
    BTHOOM! BTHOOM!
  

      

  Pink, Yellow! The machinery pieces circled ominously as the last beam charged up. The entire Hyper Gate shook as a cyan beam completed its loop! Teto looked on with glee, as if she was going to see her parents for the first time in years!...
 
  
    BTHOOM!
  
 
  The rainbow turned MENACING orange! 
 
  “(
  Hold up)
  ”, Neru fleetingly thought, “
  ‘(Menacing’, that isn’t a Jo-)
  ”

      

      
  She didn’t have time to finish that thought, as the orange seeped into the pentagram around All That Was Left of Ian, and a massive tower of orange light skyrocketed upwards, tearing through the sky!! 
 
  
    KCHHHCRRRRR!!!
  
 
      
  “
  EMILIANO 
  
    MOTHERFUCKING 
  
  RODOLFO!
  ” Neru was 
  
    majorly unnerved
  
   by the crime against the universe taking place, but Teto and Nozomi were still just as ecstatic. 
 
      
  “
  Now!!
  ”, Teto barked.
 
  The two began throwing copies of some kind of reddish brown book with some weird-looking anime characters on it. Could it be…
 
      
  “
  ...No! That weird fucking hentai encyclopedia!? Clearly, this is the worst possible timeline if 
  
    this
  
   is the best plan you can come up with! I should’ve stayed home with Haku and avoided this 
  
    embarrassment
  
  !
  ” The other two seemed unfazed, staring into the beam.The beam hit something high up in the atmosphere, the ozone layer perhaps, and an ungodly sound akin to scraping metal rang out throughout! The beam kept on going upwards, although as to where Neru was unsure. Space? The other dimension? Had it finally happened, this “historical moment”, meant to flood the world with overtly hygy monster girls? 
 
  
    TRRRRMSCHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII…!!!
  
 
  The Hyper Gate Beam tore through the very fabric of existence.

  “(
  
    Ah, it’s a beautiful day outside
  
  ,)” Matthew thought to himself. That’s right, . What, did you forget about him? 
 
  “(
  
    Birds are singing, flowers are blooming…i)”
  
 
      
  “
  
    On days like these, gamers like me… ought to be inside, playing 
  
  Terraria.
  
    ”
  
   Matthew had over 700 hours clocked into the game, but the game had nearly endless replayability. Hopping onto his Gamer Battlestation, Matthew slammed the RGB™ Keyboard like Señor Pelo slaps his desk. Terraria automatically booted up, in 4k/60 fps no less! He was greeted by the ever-familiar title screen.
 
      

      
  “
  
    Now that’s the *chef’s kiss*That's the good shit right there. Time to 
  
  
    game
  
  
    !
  

   
  
    Let’s see… what was I doing in my melee run…? Right, I still had to find the Jungle Temple. Y’know, Matthew, maybe it wasn’t a good idea to play on an Extra-Large world.
  
 
      
  As Matthew’s character, decked out in the finest of chlorophyte, waded through the murky depths of the Underground Jungle, a thought popped into his head.
 
      
  “
  
    Huh… wonder what Ian’s been up to all this time. I haven’t seen him since that crazy guy showed up at Ike’s. Hope he’s not dead.”
  
 
      
  
    TRRRRM…!!!
  

      

  A horrid, mechanical grinding sound, however, derailed Matthew’s train of thought. He ran downstairs!
 
  “
  
    GODDAMMIT, JARED, DID YOU THROW A CINDER BLOCK INTO THE WASHING MACHINE 
  
  
    AGAIN!?
  
  ”, he yelled.
 
  Jared, Matthew’s roommate, was in the condo’s kitchen, microwaving a Hot Pocket. He turned away from the pizza-flavored turnover.
 
  “
  
    Nah,''
  
   said Jared.
 
  
    “Then what the hell was that?!”
  
 
  
    “i’unno.” 
  
 
  
    “You don’t know?”
  
 
  
    “i’unno”
  
   The microwave beeped. Jared took the Hot Pocket out.
 
  “
  
    oh, shit, did you want one?”
  

  Back at the scene of the crime
 
      
  Neru Akita was quite literally quivering in her boots. Her closest ally, and whatever said ally had previously created, had both seemingly lost themselves to… whatever this doomsday device was going to inevitably spit out. 
 
  “
  C-can you even hear me… Guys!?
  ”
 
   All That Was Left of Ian sprung up! The books thrown into the beam ripped themselves apart and swirled around. Some pages went upwards into the beam, but most rammed into the lump! It shook, and cracked, and something began to crack!
 
  “
  Teee-to!!,
  ” Teto yelled over the ripping of space-time, “
  Awaken, my master!!

  “
  Ay, ya, ya, ya, yaie!!
  ”, Nozomi chanted.
 
      
  Teto rushed over to her, and the two stuck some kind of awkward-looking pose, as if attempting to flex. The thing that was in the beam punched out of it! It was… IAN!? 
 
      
  “
  GUESS WHAT, FUCKERS!? I’M BA-
  ” Ian(?) paused, looking down at himself.
 
      
  “
  -hold one one second.
  ” And so everybody did.
 
  Within that time, somehow, he had obtained a charcoal gray three-piece suit (with an orange tie). But something was off about him. He seemed slimmer, within a normal height range for a human, and overall of a bulkier complexion. Oh, and there was also the fact that he had hair and eyes the same unnaturally bright orange the Hyper Gate’s Dimension Beam was. I probably should’ve mentioned that. Clearly, this was 
  
    not
  
   Ian anymore.
 
      
  He joined them in their horrible pose. The three seemed like they were simultaneously trying too hard and not trying at all.
 
      
  To Neru’s worst nightmare, this was, in fact, 
  
    a motherfucking JoJo reference
  
  . A bad attempt at one, at that!
     12,000! Neru got hurt and collapsed... 
      
  Neru assumed the fetal position and began a horrid combination of bawling her eyes out and coughing up blood (or her equivalent of blood, at least). The orange man looked on with disdain.
 
      
  “
  Wow. What’s 
  
    her
  
   problem?
  ”, the orange man inquired.
 
  “
  She doesn’t know how to appreciate a good Jojoke! Ohohohohohohoho!
  ”
 
  Nozomi joined in on the maniacal cackling.
 
  “
  Kuuhuuhaahaahaa!!
  ” “
  Tehahahaahaa!!
  ” Clearly, all three of the antagonists were high on something.
 
  “
  Mmph.. *
  PKUH
  **
  PKUH
  *... wh-y…
  ”, Neru sputtered.
 
  “
  Why, for the funny Jojo reference! Muda Muda~!!
  ”, the orange man gleefully replied.
 
  “
  Yo, Angelo!
  ”, joked Nozomi. 
 
  The orange man cleared his throat.
 
  “
  So. It’ll take a few minutes for the beam to push 
  
    all the way
  
   through. Great job on getting that set up, team! 
  
    Really
  
   enjoying the synergy between you two. I ought to give you a promotion.
  ” He seemed oddly serious. Granted, he was dressed business-formal.
 
  “
  Promotion!?
  ”, Teto squealed. Nozomi gasped.
 
  “
  
    I’ll
  
   get to be Student Council President?
  ”
 “You know what, sure.” It seems like the orange man was taking the concept of “final boss” a bit too literally. “Anyhoo, we’re gonna have to go over our ‘agenda’ once more. What’s our 30-60-90 plan for monster girl domination? And Teto, when are you gonna have the rest of the M-series online?” 
  “
  M-monster girl domination!?
  ”, squeaked Neru, in a moment of lucidity, before returning to her Jojoke-induced seizure. She attempted to social distance from this utter nonsense.
 
  “
  Of 
  
    course
  
  , Neru-
  
    chan
  
  . Did you miss the memo on that? Or would you personally prefer monster girl submission?
  ”
 
  “
  Uh… about that.
  ” Teto said meekly, expecting more of a  “9th layer of hell” boss than a “9-5 work week” boss.
 
  “
  Boss,” Nozomi interrupted, “I think we need to address the elephant in the room before that…!
  ”
 
  “
  
    Ah, yes.
  
   Good point, Nozomi-
  
    chan
  
  . M-9 is still at large, isn’t she?.
  ”, the orange man asked.
 
  “
  No, I was referring to the glowing teal thing in the sky.
  ”
 
  “
  The- 
  
    Oh
  
  . That’s a problem…
  ”
 
   A teal streak of light tore across the sky, getting closer by the second.

  “
  Binoculars.

  “
  Binoculars.

  “
  Don’t tell me that that’s-
  ”, Teto started.
 
  “
  THE MEEKS!! Ahhh 
  
    shit
  
  , Ahhh, shit! Get yourself together, INA!!
  ”, The orange man hollered, pounding his temples. 
 
  That was the crazy bastard’s name! “INA”. (No affiliation to the octopus vtuber whatsoever)
 
  “
  
    Remember. You are THE antagonist. You are
  
  『MENACING』
  
    .
  
  ” 
 “Target incoming in T-minus 10… 9…” Teto counted down, as both of Miku’s twintails were easily discernible at this point. Nozomi manifested her Drive, but INA put a hand over her shoulder. 
      
  “
  Not yet, Nozomi-
  
    chan
  
  …

  “
  Oh… 
  
    You’re saying I get to have 
  
  another 
  
    go at her tiddies!?

  “
  Not that, either.

  “
  4… 3… 2… 1...
  ”, Teto continued. 
 
      
  THHD!
 
      
  Miku Magdalen Hatsune flipped herself around and landed dramatically, about a dozen meters from the Hyper Gate.
 
      
  “
  Oooh. Nailed the landing. That’s a ten. 
  ”, Teto japed sarcastically. Miku looked down at Neru, who was still a blubbering mess after such a horrible attempt at a JoJo meme was made.
 
      
  “
  TRAITOR.
  ”, barked Miku. Neru blubbered even harder!
 
      
  “
  What the fuck is going on here?!
  ”, she furiously yelled. Neru looked up to meet her adversary.
 
      
  “
  I-I-I don’t even know 
  
    anymore
  
  !!
  ”, she cried out.
      
 
  “
  Pathetic as always…
  ”, she murmured before punting the Boukaloid aside.
 
      
  “
  And as for 
  
    you…
  
  ” Miku approached the three. INA didn’t bother to make the same Jojoke this time. Not only because 
  
    twice
  
   in one day was tacky, but because Miku was too LAME to bother responding to it correctly! Regardless, he 
  
    did
  
   say something.
 
      
  “
  Eeh~? Watashi?
  ” He seemed like he was impersonating someone. It reminded Miku vaguely of herself.
 
      
  “
  No, you bitch-bastard, I was talking about
  
     her
  
  .
  ” Miku drew out a blade of light and pointed to Teto, who was trying to look cute, yet failed because she was thirty.

  Miku resoundingly replied “

  ”, much to INA’s dismay.
 
      
  “
  Are you seriously fucking ignoring me!? After 
  
    all the trouble
  
   that I went to, getting this goddamn hell ritual set up, you go after my

    my lil’ sister
  
  … into THAT. THING.
  ” She pointed one of the blades over to a spot on the asphalt, soaked with what resembled goldenrod silly putty. “
  Where’d she-
  ”
 
  “
  So the parking lot is your sister?
  ”, Nozomi sarcastically exclaimed. “
  Wow! Nice to meet you, Missus Hatsune!
  ”
 
  “
  No, Bad-Touch, I meant-
  ” 
 
  “
  NERU!
  ”, The UTAU interjected.
 
  “
  And not only that, but because of 
  
    your
  
   neglect, Miku, you ended up paying a 
  
    little extra
  
  ! If only Gumi could see you now... Ohohohohohoho!!
  ”
 
  “
  YOU SONNOVA-
  ” The two went at each other's throats, clashing attack after attack off of each other’s weapons! INA pouted.
 
  “
  
    Look at you, with a 
  
  personal
  
     beef…
  
  
    ” 
  
 
  
    “
  
  
    Coming all this way just to get mad at an old fogey way past her expiration date, who can’t POSSIBLY be a major threat anymore…

  “
  IT’S NOT LIKE 
  
    I’M
  
   ABOUT TO DESTROY THE WORLD OR ANYTHING…
  ”
 
  The two nemeses paused, turning to INA.
 
      
  “
  We’ll all just go home then.
  ”, Miku said flatly. Teto used this opportunity for an underhanded impaling attack, jabbing Miku right through her abdomen!
 
      
  “
  get FUCKED nerd
  ” “
  RODO-
  ” The two resumed their clash, now with intermittent insults being thrown!
 
      
  “
  ‘GO HOME THEN’!?”, bellowed INA, “You ungrateful little 
  
    bastards!!
  
   I’ve tried 
  
    so
  
   hard to be your nemesis, manipulating everything from the shadows of that wretched cholesterol ball’s mind for 
  
    months
  
  , and then
  
     YOU
  
   turn around and reject me for some GREMLIN!!
  ” He was ignored.
 
      
  “
  It’s okay, Boss. 
  
    I
  
   think you’re a reprehensible supervillain.
  ”, Nozomi reassured. “
  But I don’t think you’re gonna win her over like 
  
    that
  
  .
  ”
 
      
  “
  Whaddaya mean?
  ” 
 
  In the background jabs of “
  Pretentious, Pretentious, Pretentious!
  ” and “
  Degenerate, Degenerate, Degenerate!
  ” could be heard. INA half expected one of them to start throwing knives.
 
      
  “
  Use your brain, Boss. I do it all the time! What does Miku hate 
  
    more
  
   than Teto?
  ”

      

      
  “
  Xenoblade Chronicles 2…!
  ” Miku stopped beating on Teto. She snapped around, with divine fury in her eyes. He finally got what he was looking for. INA held his arms to the sky, almost triumphant!
 
  “
  Is 
  
    better
  
   than the Xenoblade Chronicles for the Nintendo Wii!!

  Miku had been so offended by that notion, that she had started shrieking and swearing in her native tongue. 
 
  “
  You did it, Boss!
  ”, cheered Nozomi. Teto went after Miku, but was met with a heavy greatsword slammed down on her head!
 
  10,500! It’s a Critical Hit!
 
  “
  This madness has gone on long enough!”, bemoaned Neru, prying the sword out of the collapsed UTAU’s head “I 
  
    REFUSE
  
   to partake in it ANY LONGER! I QUIT!
  ” Neru had gotten over her fit, only to replace it with another fit!
 
  “
  You know you’re supposed to do that two weeks in advance, right?
  ”, INA smugly replied.
 
  “
  wow, great, you’ve really redeemed yourself, now we can be bffs again, yaaaaay…
  ” Miku half-heartedly said, before something in the sky caught her attention. Aside from the slow humming of the Hyper Gate, everything went dead silent
 
  Then Neru started looking at 
  
    it
  
  . Then Teto. Then Nozomi.
 
  Finally, INA turned around to see what the deal was.

  Sticking out of the clouds was a giant man in a red t-shirt, except he didn’t have a normal head. Past the top of his nose, an iridescent squid with beady eyes on either side of it. 

      

  “
  It can’t be…

  A voice bellowed from the heavens!
 
  “
  Hey, everybody! It’s Chuggaaconroy!!

  All That Was Left of Ian, motionless in the strange circle, suddenly wasn’t quite motionless. It rolled right out of the circle!
 
  “

  “

  “

  ”, shrieked Miku. 
 
      
  “
  YOUR RESURRECTION IS AT HAND! RETURN TO YOUR BODY, BITCH!
  ” 
 
  And so he did.
 
      
  The light faded, and Ian was left on the ground. Thankfully, he was clothed. This was the preferable way of seeing him (RODOLFO only knows what horrors Eli had been exposed to). He was still out cold, though.
 
      
  “

  “
  So where’d Nozomi go?
  ”, INA inquired. Unfortunately, Miku had found herself on the receiving end of 
  
    someone
  
   grabbing at her… again.
 
      
  “
  
    Kuhuuhuuhuu!!

  “
  You’re sick! SICK! Do you hear me!? Somehow, you’ve managed to be hygier than even Ian!

  “
  
    Oh, now’s my chance!
  
  ”, INA thought, making sure that 
  
    he’d

  Ian bolted upright.
 
      
  “
  
    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
  
  ”, he shrieked. One would think that upon coming back from the dead, he would have something better to say, but apparently not. INA was taken aback by that; Ian looked around.
 
      
  “What the flippity-floppity 
  
    fuck!
  
  ? This ain’t mah house! What the hell did Len do with me...? And who th’ hell’re you!?

  “
  Why, good sir, I’m the greatest thing to ever happen to ya!
  ”
 
      
  “Naw, that ain’t right. You’re not Michelle.” INA was stumped again at this man’s sheer dumbassery.
 
      
  “
  Wait, what
  ” 
 
  “Hey, look! There’s Michelle! She’s over there, getting bullied by that purple-haired lady! Oh, shit, I gotta go and help!”
 
      
  “
  Ian, wait! Didn’t Michelle 
  
    lie to you
  
   for years about being rich and famous!?
  ”, INA asked Ian.
 
      
  “Yuh, but that ain’t gonna deter me.” 
 
  “
  Did she ever let you see her… twenty-three yachts?
  ” 

  “Nah. An’ if that’s some kinda sex euphamism that th’ cool kids on Tumblr Dot Com like to use, then double-nuh.”
 
      
  “
  Then she can wait a few minutes. Besides that, Ian, what did we-- I-I mean, what did 
  
    you

  INA sighed. “
  Now, Ian, 
  
    buddy
  
  , what I’m doing here today, is giving 
  
    you
  
   one HELL of an offer!
  ”
 
  Ian was still spaced out as he said, “Watanabe?” INA didn’t particularly like that.
 
  “
  No, you dunce, I meant ‘you’ as in ‘you’, and besides, Ol’ Boat Cuck’s name is pronounced ‘Yo’, as in ‘Yo, Angelo’, so that ‘joke’ doesn’t even have a 
  
    leg
  
   to stand on.
  ”
 
  “Didn’t ya just use that joke today, like, fifteen minutes ago?”, Ian asked. 
 
  “
  HOW THE 
  FLYING FUCK
   DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT? YOU WERE DEAD!
  ”, INA yelled, all the while the washi assault continued in the background.
 
  “
  
    Let go of me, you dip!
  
  ”, cried Miku.
 
  “I read those pages.”, Ian said nonchalantly.
 
  “

  “Doesn’t look too friendly to me.”
 
   “

    don’t get any ideas

   “
  Well, Ian, what’s the thing you want most in life, right now?
  ”
 
  Ian, instead of staring off into space, stared straight at INA.
 
  “Cheesecake.” “
  ...Come again?
  ”
 
  “Cheesecake, I love cheesecake, late at night, top if off-” “
  No, my good man, I am afraid what I have is 
  
    not
  
   cheesecake.

  “Is it pie? Pecan pie?” “
  It is not pie.

  Ian, why would I seriously be offering you 
  
    baked goods
  
   when I have --
  ” INA puckered every consonant:
 
  “
  
    Big. Tiddy. Kitsune. Gee. Eff.
  
  ” Ian was taken aback.
 
  “B-big Tiddy Kitsune GF!?” “
  Very big, very big tiddy, like Nozomi, or even 
  
    Emma
  
  .
  ”
 
  “E-EMMA TIDDY?” “
  Emma. Tiddies.
  ” Ian managed to collect himself and became momentarily less hygy.
 
  “
  But what of the fluffy tail? Can I touch ‘em?” “
  I dunno man, it’s up to you and the mamono to decide if you can touch fluffy tail.
  ” Ian quivered with that last phrase.
 
  “
  But alas, you won’t find out unless you give the button a little press… Whaddaya say?
  ” INA realized he had been speaking to no one, as Ian was already rushing over to the machine -- and The Button. With a smile on his face akin to a kid in a candy store, Ian slam-dunked the orange button. 
 
      
  Klaxon blares were heard as the Hyper Gate entered a new phase, only to be interrupted with a horrible metallic grinding!
 
      
  
    KRRRRRRRRRRRKRRRRIIIII!!!
  
 
      
  The chunks of machinery around the beam spun at blazing speeds  in the opposite direction, as the beam had been set from “push” to “pull”! Energy whirled downwards around the beam, in a maelstrom of dimensional destruction!
 
  “
  WHAT HAVE YOU WROUGHT, YOU HYGY, HYGY MAN!?!
  ”, sobbed Miku.
 
  “Uhhh…”, muttered Ian. “A Big Tiddy Kitsune GF, right?” He turned to INA.
 
  “RIGHT…?! 
  
    OI! ORANGE GUY
  
  !?”

      

  A small, mechanical voice came from the Hyper Gate’s diplay, seemingly in reaction to Ian’s whining:
 “Locating Inari… 139 specimens found within 100 kilometer(s) of contact point . Please input specifications.” 
  “What?!” Ian noticed a keyboard pop out from under the display, as INA typed something else on the machine.

  
  
“Specifications: ‘Kitsune-no-kyuubi'. 1 matching DE Signature found within 100 kilometer(s) of contact point. Target pursuit beginning in 3… 2… 1… Pursuing target.”   
  The majority of those gathered here were horrified. Some kind of foam began to form around the crack in the sky. Not INA, however, as this was his plan all along. 
 
  “
  ARE YOU READY FOR A GOOD TIME, BUCKAROO?!
  ”, he cackled.
 
  Ian, similarly, was not as terrified as he should have reasonably been, as he was too preoccupied with another thought.
 
  “(Why do I smell saltwater...?)”

  The Other Side

  Zipangu, “The Kingdom of The Sun”. With certain current events involving archdemons hungry for power (among other things) conquering and corrupting vast swaths of the world, this relatively small archipelago nation nestled in the far eastern reaches has become prime real estate for those not wanting to go Demonic Energy-crazy; humans and mamono alike. Being as far as possible from the Royal Makai, the demons’ Capital, has proved to work out quite in favor for the native Zipangese -- Mamono Lord Lilith’s influence can quite literally be shrugged off. This has allowed for humans and mamono to obtain a relatively peaceful coexistence, with some of the strongest species, such as the Inari and the Ryu, locally worshipped as patron deities. 
 
  This brings us to our two observers of the other side of the dimensional collapse:
 
      
  A shirohebi named Sani, and a kitsune-tsuki named Hiko, both attendants of a Ryu shrine dedicated to one only referred to as “
  
    Xiu
  
  ”, located on the eastern edge of one of the more southern isles in the chain. This shrine, dedicated to the Ryu, serves as a spiritual conduit, all with a great view of the unending sea to the east!
 
  Today was going to be like any other day, or so one Missus Sani thought to herself. Or at least, as normal as a day would be if she and the new hire were the 
  
    only 
  
  ones at the shrine.
 
  “
  
    Remind me, again, why we weren’t invited to the Rain Blessing Ceremony today?
  
  ”, Hiko inquired.
 
  “
  
    Well, the Grand Mistress Xiu, in her DIVINE wisdom, did assign usss to 
  
  “‘
  
    guard the shrine…’
  
  ”, hissed Sani.
 
  “
  
    From what?! Order goons have never set a foot on this island, and the ONE Ushi-oni here has yet to make a scene…!”
  
 
  “
  
    Hiko. You’re fresh meat. I’m gonna let you in on a sssecret. Thisss is because the Grand Mistresss doesn’t like usss.
  
  ”
 
  “
  
    Doesn’t like us? Whyever is that?!
  
  ” 
 
  “
  
    I just sssaid why she doesn’t like ya! ‘Cuz you’re fresh meat, a new transssssfer from the western shrine, run by that furry, haughty, 
  
  know-it-all
  
    !
  
  ”
 
  “
  
    Don’t you DARE talk about Lady Ninse like that!!”,
  
   Hiko whined.
 
  “
  
    Go on, spit it out! Why’d she ssssend ya over here?
  
  ”
 
  “
  
    I may or may not have interrupted... her a-
  
  ” 
 
      
  Even though there was hardly a cloud in the sky (mostly why Xiu was gonna make it rain in the first place), a tremendous thunderclap resounded over the cliffside shrine!

  “
  
    Oh, fuck, she’s back already, and we were supposed to clean!!
  
  ”, yelped Hiko.
 
      
  “
  
    That ain’t the Grand Mistresss, newbie!! LOOK!”,
  
   Sani pointed to a crack in the sky itself!
 
      
  “
  
    Instead of the Order’s knights, we’ll have to stave off The Chief God herself!?!
  
  ”
 
      
  “
  
    Sssince when was she, or anything elssse related, ORANGE?” 
  
 
  
        
  
  The crack in the sky widened, until the sky itself shattered! A colossal pillar or orange light burst right through, and rammed right into the ocean!
 
      
  “
  
    That thing’s gotta be 
  
  miles
  
     wide!
  
  ”, Hiko shouted. Sani whipped around, slithering uphill to the “heart” of the shrine! The behemoth began to rotate, dragging up seawater into it. It resembled a waterspout grown far too big for its own good!
 
      
  “
  
    What the Pandaemonium do you plan on doing, Sani!?
  
  ”, cried Hiko.
 
      
  “
  
    I think I sssaw Xiu do this once, jussst get out of here, as far away as posssible! Go find Lady Ninse!
  
  ”
 
      
  “
  
    Sani, no!
  
  ”
 
      
  “
  
    Just sssave yourself, kiddo!
  
  ”
 
      
  At the center of the Eastern shrine, Sani began to cast the most powerful warding spell she knew. Hiko, following her co-worker’s instructions, fled the scene, in hopes of arriving in the nearby towns before the calamity did.
 
      
  “✌︎☠︎✡︎ ☞︎☜︎💣︎✌︎☹︎☜︎ 👌︎⚐︎☼︎☠︎ ✌︎☞︎❄︎☜︎☼︎ 📂︎🖲︎🖲︎🗏︎ 👍︎✌︎☠︎❄︎ 👍︎⚐︎⚐︎😐︎” Periwinkle flames ertupted around the floor of the shrine in an arcane pattern.
 
      
  “✌︎☹︎☹︎ ❄︎☟︎☜︎✡︎ 😐︎☠︎⚐︎🕈︎ ✋︎💧︎ 💣︎👍︎👎︎⚐︎☠︎✌︎☹︎👎︎💧︎” 
 
  The dispelling spell continued, even though Sani knew it wouldn't permanently stop it.
 
      
  “👍︎☟︎✌︎☼︎☝︎☜︎ ❄︎☟︎☜︎✡︎ 🏱︎☟︎⚐︎☠︎☜︎”  The ground began to shake! The calamity had started to make landfall!
 
      
  “☜︎✌︎❄︎ ☟︎⚐︎❄︎ 👍︎☟︎✋︎🏱︎” Sani struggled to cast the last bar, as bits of the shrine began to be torn away. 
 
  “✌︎☠︎👎︎-” Sani never got to finish the incantation, as the whole roof of the shrine tore off! In a brazen orange sky, as seafoam and debris spiraled upwards and around, ripping into the heavens’ gaping maw. Sani was unfortunately going to join the rest of the shrine. 
 
  “

   Whether it was due to the g-forces, the stress, or the lack of oxygen (or maybe all of the above), she passed out along the ride.

  The foam gave way to dust, as a small, orange speck was seen emerging from the tear in reality. It descended like a falling star.
 
      
  “
  We’ve got contact!

  “
  Contact!?

  “
  Target incoming,  1 o’clock!
  ”, bellowed INA.
 
  “1 o’clock? I thought it was 
  
    8 o’clock?
  
  ”, said Ian, yet no one seemed to hear the “joke”. Miku was still trying to break out of Nozomi’s washi washi attack. The opportunity had presented itself, as the eighth muse was strangely fixated on the falling object with a vaguely hygy outlook, one step away from a stereotypical anime nosebleed. 
 
  As the object descended further, its details began to become clear. It was completely encased in a strange, orange, crystalline substance, yet the contents remained a mystery. 
 
  With a whistle like a cartoon bomb, the crystalline object smashed into the asphalt a bit too close for comfort to everyone present, scattering shards of material all over!
 
  What lay inside, however, seemed to be unfazed by the fall.
 
  A half-waifu, half-snake abomination, with her lower half seemingly replaced by a giant snake’s tail. The tail and her hair were both white as snow, but the eyes were blood red.
 This thing was a monster girl. 
  “
  Object landed! First 
  
    mamono
  
   in town!
  ”, barked Teto. 
 
  “
  I-I… I can’t believe it! It worked! It WORKED!!
  ”, INA giggleed. Ian, however, appeared to be completely beside himself. He was quivering like a bowl of Jello, and his face was as red as the cherry flavor too! Nozomi was reacting similarly, presumably for the same (yet opposite) reason. 
 
  “
  
    So we’re just gonna pretend like that incident with the slime girl never happened…?
  
  ”, bemoaned Neru. 
 
  Her counterpart/”older sister” was upset with a much higher magnitude, sputtering phrases such as “
  hygy hygy hygy
  ”, “
  disgustang
  ”, and “
  hhhhhh domt liek that.
  ”
 
  The snake 
  
    thing
  
   opened its eyes and tentatively observed its surroundings. It didn’t say a word, likely because it was still in a state of shock. Ian was the first to break the silence, stomping over to INA, pulling a complete 180 from his prior demeanor.

  “And ya wanna know why, bitch? ‘CUZ THAT AIN’T A BIG TIDDY KITSUNE!” 
 
  Nozomi interjected. “
  Wow, I wouldn’t have been able to tell! Thank you, professor Ian. Truly, your services are invaluable!
  ”
 
  He strode up to the aberration, not social distancing at all, something even 
  
    it
  
   found uncomfortable, recoiling away slightly.
 
  “This. Right. Here. Is a 
  
    shirohebi

   genus native to the Zipangu archipelago. Typically known for having yandere tendencies, and are most closely affiliated with the mana element of

  .”
 
  “
  Another astounding revelation from the great biologist, Ian! Surely, he shall go down in history with the likes of Charles Darwin, Gregor Mendel, and Crocodile Dundee!
  ”, continued Nozomi. Neru seemed like she was on the verge of laughing, a rare sight for her! Miku, on the other hand, was about to die of second-hand embarrassment.
 
  “Ya said you had a ‘
  
    Big Tiddy Kitsune
  
  ’ to offer me, did you not, Mr. Creamsicle? Then, I implore you, where is it!? Is it an Inari, a Youko?!” Ian was… a bit too passionate. A few more falling objects emerged from the tear in the sky, no doubt more monster girls, but the group was too busy focused on Ian being a cringy dingus to care.
 
  “
  (Oh, shit, I did say that.)
  ” INA began to improvise. “
  Uhhh, ummm… 
  
    please allow 5 to 10 business days 
  
  for all Outer Demons™ orders to ship out.
  ”
 
  “
  ...’Outer Demons’.
  ”, nonchalantly replied Teto.
 
   “
  Yes, that’s our company name. Our EVIL company name. ‘Outer Demons, we’re all going to hell, why not enjoy the ride?’
  ” This didn’t particularly convince Ian.
 
  “Five ta ten business days!? Oh, but ya can press a fucking button, and get a mamono within ten 
  
    minutes!
  
   Great customer service ya got there, ain’t it!?”
 
  “
  My, my…
  ”, Nozomi muttered slyly, “
  
    You seem awfully fixated on getting this long-deserved ‘waifu’ of yours, Ian
  
  ~
  ”
 
  “And you ain’t the same, astrologer?”, he squeaked.
 
  “
  
    That’s funny, I thought Tetocchi over here already gave you one!
  
  ” Once again, Ian started to shake. All, even the shirohebi, were fixated on the two. INA looked like he wanted popcorn.
 
  “
  ...
  
    or is Eli not good enough for you? Maybe she didn’t like you at all!!
  
  
    ”
  
   Ian was poorly attempting to hold back, shaking so much that he almost seemed to be having a seizure standing up. For the first (and only) time in many, many years, the Triple Baka Gang of Miku, Neru, and Teto, all looked at each other and agreed on something -- Ian was gonna give.
 
  “
  
    If that’s the case, then I’ll just take her back!♡ She’d be better off far, 
  
  far
  
    , away from you, …
  
  ” Even INA was worried by this point!
 
  “
  Ya fuckin’
   simp.
  ” 
 
  
    Nozomi’s strongest attack, putting even the dreadful Washi Washi to shame!
  
 
  500!!
 
  Ian got hurt…
 
      
  
    And was ready to slap a bitch!

   An inhuman screech rattle out of Ian’s body!!
 
      
  “
  🅰️🅰️🅰️🅰️🅰️
  ”
 
      
  He raced over to the eighth muse, and bitch-slapped her!
 
  2!
 
  “
  Did you honestly plan on accomplishing something with that, Ian?
  ”, muttered Nozomi. Strangely, this jab didn’t further hurt Ian. No, far from it. For the first time in nearly a year, all three of Ian’s brain cells sparked together in a glorious harmony!

      
 
  “You’re right. I wasn’t-” 
 
  “
  So you finally admit to being damaged?
  ”, blurted out Neru. 
 
  “
  
    Chuggaaconroy said I needed to be the change…
  
  ”, muttered Ian, to no one in particular, “
  
    I need to do what’s right…
  
  ”
 
  “
  You do realize I’m still here, right?
  ”, said Nozomi. Maybe Neru was right about Ian.
 
  “
  
    She’s clearly not the thing I need to slap. I mean, the worst she’s done is molest children,-
  
  ”
 
  “
  I never did that! Per se…
  ”
 
  “
  
    Embezzle thousands in student council money
  
  ,
  
    ”
  
   It seemed like he wasn’t entirely aware.
 
  “
  What… what are you talking about...
  ”
 
  “
  
    backstab her girlfriend
  
  -”
 
  “
  It’s not backstabbing if the overall outcome was positive!
  ”
 
  “
  
    and also try to kill me.
  
  ”
 
  “
  Okay, y ou got me there.
  ”
 
  “
  
    But the real bad guy is…
  
  ” 

   

  “
  Who’s it gonna be, Ian~?
  ” Teto sneeredsingsongingly. Ian looked distant. He bitch-slapped her, too!
 
  2!
 
  He went over to the Hyper Gate, bitchslapped INA!
 
  2!
 
  “
  
    SUCH INSOLENCE HAS NE-
  
  ” 
 
  Ian kicked Neru while she was down… 
 
  3!
 
  And, for consistency’s sake, slapped Miku without hesitation.
 
  20!
 
  Ian turned his sights to the shirohebi, who was still here and was looking very confused, before INA started yelling!
 
  “
  
    SUCH INSOLENCE HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE! After everything I do for you, you see it fit to SMACK ME?
  
   PAH. I never needed you anyways!
  ” Miku was rubbing her cheek, wondering what the fuck was wrong with these two.
 
  “You’re the bad guy that Chuggaaconroy said I have to defeat… I think… ”, Ian mumbled.
 
  “
  Bad guy!? Oh, what gave it away?! The doomsday device!?!
  ”, he roared.
 
  “Uhh, so are you gonna kill me now?”
 
      
  “
  As if I’d waste my time on 
  
    you
  
  !
  ”
 
  “...Watanabe?”
 
  INA facepalmed with one hand, and cast… something with the other. Orange energy surrounded his left arm, and as he brought down his right, INA pointed at Ian and bellowed:
 
  “
  
    git da muffuga
  
  ”

    The feral Shirohebi attacked!
  
 
      

      
  The snake-woman, now mind-controlled, lunged at Ian!
 
      
  “OH, SWEET JESUS, FUCK!”, he bawled.
 
      
  “
  Sorry, Ian, but he won’t be able to help you now.
  ” INA said spryly, “
  The
  
     Monster Girl Encyclopedia
  
   gives me complete and total control over all[*] mamono!
  ” The shirohebi coiled around Ian! He would’ve been more scared if he wasn’t into it!
 
      
  “
  That can’t be how it works!
  ”, interjected Neru.
 
      
  “
  
    Dispose of this THOT as well, minion! 
  
  Nozomi, why don’t we ditch these assholes?
  ” The shirohebi, obeying commands from its new master, dropped Ian and went after Neru instead! Ian felt somewhat dejected about this.
 
      
  “
  
    I THOUGHT 
  
  
    I
  
  
     WAS YOUR FAVORITE, BOSS!
  
  ”, cried out Teto.
 
      
  “
  
    oh, yeah, yeah, you, you can come too…
  
  ”, INA said defeatedly. The shirohebi repeated its coiling move around Neru. Miku was jealous that 
  
    she
  
   wasn’t the one putting the hurt on Neru at the moment.
 
      
  “
  So the snake thing is supposed to do our work for us now?
  ”, Nozomi inquired. 
 
      
  “
  For right now, yes.
  ” 

  
  

  Neru took out her Drive and started hacking at the beast!

      
  
    405! 401! 400! 403! 402! 
  
  The shirohebi howled in pain!
 
  “
  So we’re gonna take over the world with one measly little thing, even if it’s already being turned into mincemeat?
  ”
 
  “
  Have you bothered to look up in the past few minutes?
  ”
 
  “
  I’m gonna look up and it’ll say ‘gullible’ in the sky, isn’t it?
  ”
 
  “
  No, just LOOK you DOLT!
  ”, Teto grumbled. Neru kept at it on the snake monster. Miku had a small change of heart, and felt glad that Neru was suffering, regardless of who was inflicting it. Ian still had no idea what was going on, but felt like he heard tires screeching off in the distance.
 
  
    415! 409! 411! 414!
  
   
 
  The shirohebi’s hands glowed with whitish-blue energy as it scratched at Neru!
  
    
    
  

  
    343! 347!
  
 
      
  Nozomi scoffed as she glanced upwards. Thankfully, the sky did 
  
    not
  
   say “gullible”. Instead, 
  
    more
  
   of the orange crystalline pods were falling out of the portal, crashing about the once peaceful suburbs, no doubt summoning more monster girls!  Ian swore he heard a car, but it didn’t matter what he thought.
 
      
  “
  Ah.
  ”, said Nozomi.
 
      
  Neru slashed one final time, and plunged the zweihander deep into the shirohebi’s gut!
 
      
  
    1,200!
  
 
      
  The shirohebi let out one final screech before rupturing into glossy black orbs, each about a couple inches in diameter. They floated in mid-air briefly before slamming into Neru and disappearing! A jingle came out of her HUD!
 
      
  
    Neru 
  
  
    gained 230 experience points!
  
 
  
        
  
  
    Level up!
  
 
      
  She set her sights on the newcomer that stole her role as antagonist, and charged with the zweihander!
 
      
  “
  You’ll regret that, you chud!
  ”, she cried, only to be knocked down by a very familiar Honda Civic, launching her into the air and clear over the Hyper Gate!
 
      
  “
  
    Drunk driving!!
  
  ”, the driver shouted.
 
      
  
    3,000!
  
 
  
        
  
  “
  AYYYYIIIIIII!!!
  ”
 
      
  “F in the chat.”, Ian said flatly. 
 
  “
  No.
  ”, replied Miku. 
 
  The car smashed into a nearby tree, totaling it! The driver seemed to be fine, though.
 
      
  The door to the Civic threw open, and out stumbled Haku Yowane! She smelled like the back of a VABC store.

    “
  
  
    I’M STILL RELEVANT, BITH!!
  
  ”, Haku screeched.
 
  “
  Oh Rodolfo, not her again…
  ”, Miku said with contempt.
 
  “
  
    You fuh- *hic* You fuckin’ orange prick!
  
  
    ”
  
   She staggered as she spoke. “
  
    You really never- *hic* never thought NO’ONE ever’d notice!? That YER the one who’s been pullin’ everything along behind-... behind the gaddamn stage
  
  !?
  ”
 
  “
  Missus Yowane, not only are you shit-faced drunk, but you’re late to the meeting you were 
  
    never invited to
  
  . Have you not noticed the evil portal in the sky, raining down monster girls?
  ”, INA snarled.
 
  “
  
    Oh, uh,,, ah,,, 
  
  that.
  ” Teto couldn’t help but pop a smirk at how her ally had fallen.
 
  “
  NO! You haven’t because you’re IRRELEVANT! Always have, and always will be! You and your bratty little friend will have NO PLACE in my perfect world!
  ”, roared INA.
 
  “
  ‘Bratty’? ‘BRATTY’!? 
  
    Says tha fucker who thinks workin’ with *hic-* with THAT lil’ bastard is a good idea?
  
  
    ”
  
   She threw her arm at Teto.
 
  “
  
    And what the hell did I ever do to you…!?
  
   Besides steal your happy juice… many times…
  ”
 
  “
  
    I found- *hic* found yer diary, shitface!
  
  ” Everyone (except Teto, obviously) pogged! The scene was silent for a moment, only interrupted by the whistling of falling crystals, the crackling of more emerging dust and debris, and distant sirens approaching.
 Haku continued to drunkenly ramble. “Ya knew about this absolute CREAMSICLE of a man, and used it to- *hic* to manipulate all of us into THIS? Last time ya- *hic* pulled a stunt like this, we were all sent to this shithole of a star system! Whaddaya even have to GAIN from it now!?”. 
  Nozomi laughed on the inside. But just a bit. 
  
    Just a little bit.
  
 
  “
  And what exactly do you plan on doing now?
  ”, chortled Teto.
 
  “
  I’M GONNA POP A CAP IN YOUR ASS!!1!
  ”, Haku screamed, manifesting her handgun drive, taking aim at the UTAUloid. 
 
  “
  Hah! A drunken 
  
    fool
  
   such as yourself wouldn’t even be able to 
  shoot straight
  ! Come on then, I DARE you to try it!!
  ”, Teto sneered!
 
  “
  And yet you care about 
  
    that little thing
  
   more than me!? I am literally ending the goddamn world as we speak, threatening to cut off the supply chain to the booze cruise that is your pathetic life, and yet the drill-headed pipsqueak is your number one priority!?
  ”, INA yelled. Miku thought his tantrum was a bit suspicious.
 
  After a second of reflection, Haku yelled “
  
    I’M SHOOTING 
  
  
    GAAAAAY!!!
  
  ” It was true that she wasn’t able to shoot straight. Haku wasn’t even aiming right, and so the bullet whizzed right over her, striking our antagonist right in the left eye!
 
  6,900!
 
  “
  Nice.
  ”, said Miku.
 
  “Nice.”, said Ian.
 
  “
  YOU ABSOLUTE, INDIGNANT, INDECOROUS INVALID! I OUGHTTA-...!
  ”, 
   
 
  Out of the blue (although now it was more resembling a brownish-gray), another orange crystal landed in the immediate area, shattering and revealing another strange, humanoid figure.
 
  Although this fucking thing has two arms and two legs, its skin was shale gray, and one of its irises glowed yellow. Wow! Just like Sans Undertale! Its long, black hair was tied in a ponytail, and it seemed to be partially covered in an armor made of bones. A silvery-pink katana was strapped on its back.
 
  “
  
    Ochimusha!?
  
  ”, Ian cried out.
 
  “
  Correction-”, asserted INA, “
  
    SHE
  
   OUGHTA TEACH YOU A LESSON!
  ” INA started to cast the same enchantment as earlier, but the undead warrior creaked its head towards him.
 
  It spoke in a raspy voice. “
  
    Yes… my lord…
  
  ”
 
  “
  damn, pop off, I didn’t even have to control this one
  ”, INA muttered. These  sorts of undead warriors 
  
    did
  
   tend to follow the strongest things around… 
 
   
   
      
  The ochimusha drew its blade dashed towards Haku, as DTN-3 fired off a volley of bullets in response. Of course, because she was shit-faced drunk, they didn’t exactly land on her target, one of them even striking INA again (much to his dismay), but the one that did land in the monster’s torso didn’t seem to have much of an effect. The ochimusha raised its blade, and cleaved right through Haku!
 
      
  12,000!
 
      
  It looked painful, although Haku herself was intact… at least on the outside. With a completely expressionless look, in stark contrast to her drunken temper tantrum, Haku simply lay flat on the ground, completely catatonic!
 
      
  “Outstanding! Demon Realm Silver weaponry in action!”, Ian screamed. Miku wondered what the fuck he was talking about, as this was far out of her usual terrirory. The ochimusha walked over to INA and stood next to him, as if it was reporting for duty.
 
      
  “
  Serves her right for trying to interrupt 
  
    my
  
   special moment…
  ”, INA muttered. He rubbed his shot eye. “
  Invalids like her won’t have a place in 
  
    my world…
  
  ”
 
      
  “
  Oh, is that what this is about?!
  ”, Miku chimed in half-sarcastically, waving at the horrible pillar that towered over the scene. Neru sighed and began the arduous process of dragging her collapsed roommate from the scene of the crime, something all-too-familiar to the Triple Baka Trio.
 
  “
  Gee. It sure took you an awful long time to realize that… What? Did you think my evil plan was to open a fucking bakery?!
  ”, INA sneered, falling for the bait. 
 
  “Yannow, a bakery sounds nice…”, Ian interrupted. 
 
  “
  NOBODY FUCKING ASKED YOU, FATASS.
  ”, INA roared. 
 
  “
  Well then! That’s fine by me. We’ll just take
  
     ‘those three bastards’
  
   home, deal with ‘em there, and we’ll all leave Earth behind. Like we were never here in the first place! That’s what you want, right?
  ”, said Miku nonchalantly.

  “
  ...nnGGAAAAAH! You fucking IDIOT!
  ” Hoo boy. INA grabbed Teto by the ahoge, to which the UTAU reacted with a low hiss. INA began ranting.
 
  “
  If you can’t even fill out your role, why even bother with any of this shit!? I try SO HARD to be a good antagonist for this insufferable cringefest of a crackfic, and then you decide to hit me with ‘o
  
    oh, we’ll all just go home and leave you to your big tiddy monster girls to your own devices, uwu
  
  ~’.
  ”
 
  “Hey! We aren’t supposed to break the fourth wall, remember!”, Ian interrupted.
 
  “
  
    Fourth… wall?
  
  ”, rasped the ochimusha.
 
  “
  Ah, but it’s perfectly fine whenever you do it.
  ” Nozomi retorted.
 
  “STFU, astrologer”, he replied. INA continued on his diatribe.
 
  “
  Y’know what, Miku?
  ”
 “What?”, she half-heartedly inquired. Teto struggled to free herself, squirming about haphazardly in INA’s grasp. 
  “
  You’ve ruined the experience! You’ve killed the 
  
    vibes…
  
   Now I don’t even want to kill you anymore!... 
  
    at the moment, at least
  
  . That’s right bitch, your sheer incompetence is making me have to take a mental health day!
  ”, INA wailed. Ian started craving biscotti, to go with the piping hot tea that was brewing here.
 
  “
  And I’m supposed to care about this because?
  ”
 
  “
  You, Missus Haht-soon-ay, have been unchallenged for THIRTEEN YEARS, now! Your greatest nemesis in life has proven to be 
  
    worthless
  
  , even with a whole slew of lackeys under her, whom, I might add, don’t even care enough to destroy you while they have the opportunity! FURTHERMORE, -
  ”
 
  “
  BUT I’M NOT WORTHLESS YOU DIP
  ”, Teto screeched, thrashing about like one of the lowly primates she oh-so-despised.
 
  “
  Do tell, what 
  
    grand schemes
  
   have you accomplished, O Mistress of Darkness Kasane?!
  ”, INA said haughtily.
 
  “
  I dunno, why doncha ask Gumi?
  ”
 
  “
  I don’t think that’s possible.
  ”, Miku said, making the Pensive Face™.
 
  “Why’s that?”, said Ian.
 
  “
  She’s dead.
  ”
 
      
  “
  
    How unfortunate.
  
  ”, the ochimusha said.
 
  “F’s in the chat.”
 
  “
  Yeah.
  ”
 
  “UH OH!”

  “
  U-
  ”, INA was about to say something, but stopped himself. 
 
  He dropped Teto; the UTAU skittered off… for now. The distant sounds of more falling crystals filled the scene. Soon, the shirohebi and the ochimusha weren't going to be alone. INA spoke up again.
 
  “
  You know what, Meeks? Just go ahead, go the fuck 
  
    home
  
  . Go back to your fucked up mechanical planet, even! I’ll put a rain check on the whole ‘fight to the death thing’, just for 
  
    you
  
  !
  ” He seemed oddly calm. A helicopter passed overhead. The undead warrior sheathed its blade, again with the oddly calm look. 
 
  “
  That’s… oddly considerate.
  ”, said Miku.
 
  “I don’t trust this guy, Michelle!”, yelled Ian.
 
  “
  You will, sir, in about ten days. But as for you, 
  
    twintails…
  
  ” INA pulled out his Drive…
 
  “Ya just said you’d take a rain check!!”, blurted Ian. Miku prepared for battle, aas INA slowly turned towards his… counterpart? He dropped the glaive, and it clattered on the ground. 
 
  “
  That, I did. What do you take me for?
  ”, INA said, almost mockingly. “
  I can assure you, Missus Hatsune, that 
  
    I
  
   won’t attack you with your back turned.
  ” He snapped his fingers, and an orange, seven-sided Door appeared!
 
  “
  (Tacky… even features of his HUD have to be 
  
    extra…
  
  )
  ”, Miku thought to herself.
 
  “
  Go on then. What’re you waiting for, Theaggyyu to upload again?
  ”
 
  “
  You really made a Door all the way back to Homeworld?
  ”
 
      
  “
  No, silly! To your... people house. Ah, that didn’t sound right. Whatever, just get on with it, Meeks.
  ”
 
      
  “
  I still don’t think that this is a good idea.
  ”
 
      
  “
  Melia would want you to do it.
  ”, sneered Teto.
 
      
  “
  
    I won’t believe anything coming out of you, UTAU!
  
  ”
 
      
  “
  Melia would want you to do it.
  ”, said INA. Miku shuddered.
 
      
  “
  In fact. She’s right behind you. That’s right, it’s Melia Antiqua, from Xenoblade Chronicles!
  ” Miku’s shuddering intensified. Ian shook his head with a wide-eyed look at whatever was behind her, as if a warning. Nozomi, who seemed to have been thinking about crystals or some other astrology nerd stuff, also had a similar wide-eyed look. Clearly, it must be because of Melia in REAL LIFE!
 
  “(
  Besides, who cares what Ian thinks? He’s the one who started this mess! He ruined my fucking birthday, and now he dares to get in the way of me and
  
     MELIA!?
  
   Doesn’t he know I’m the #1 Melia Simp!? I had to beat this crazy guy in Akihabara for that title!)
  ”, thought Miku. She did the unthinkable and turned around.
 
  Standing before her, in front of the Door, was none other than…
 
  Juju!?!
 
  “
  
    I am in the cutscean
  
  ”, said Juju, asserting his dominance.
 
  “
  Did you fucking follow me here!?
  ”, cried out Nozomi.
 
  “
  You’ve seen this asshole before?
  ”, said Teto.
 
  “What the hell is he doin’ here!?”, said Ian.
 
  “
  
    Dick
  
  ,” muttered Juju, sliding away.
 
  Amidst the commotion, no one bothered to think what ochimusha was doing, and Miku found herself on the business end of a certain orange someone’s glaive, which she was only made aware of as she looked down, the business end of the glaive poking out of her chest and displacing the Second Diamond.
 
  12,000!
 
  “
  You… bastard…
  ”, she murmured as she collapsed, cyanish droplets of “blood” streaming behind her as the glaive was pulled out.
 
  “nothin’ personnel, kiddo”, said the ochimusha. Ian was horrified!
 
  “
  I mean, hey, I 
  
    did 
  
  say 
  
    I
  
   wouldn’t attack you!
  ”, boasted INA. The ochimusha returned to his side.
 
  “
  Oh, good one!
  ”, said Teto, in between bouts of laughter. Ian collapsed to his knees.
 
  “
  Who wants to throw her in!?
  ”
 
  “
  We’re doing 
  
    that?
  
  ”, said Nozomi.
  
    
    
  

  “
  I DO! I DO! I DO! I DO! I DO! I DO!
  ” Teto could barely contain her excitement. 
 
  “
  Love the enthusiasm! That’s grounds for a raise!
  ”
 
  “
  YAAAAY!!
  ”cheered Teto as punted the body of her archenemy to the Door.
 
  “
  This bitch empty! Kobe!
  ”, Teto yelled, kicking the unconscious Miku like a football, barely making it into the portal! Ian hit the ground while muttering something. What a dingus!
 
  “
  Fucker, it’s ‘Yeet’, you uncultured brat! 
  
    I cancel the raise!
  
  ”, INA yelled!
 
  “

  Something began to click within Ian as all three of his brain cells began to violently rub together! The words of Chuggaaconroy resonated from deep within him…!

  “(
  
    OK maybe that’s enough reminiscing…
  
  )”, Ian thought.
 
  “
  ‘Ey, Boss, are we gonna kill this fat fuck or what?
  ”, said Teto.
 
  “
  Personally, I think it’d be funny if we left him to fend for himself amid ravenous hordes of mamono.
  ”, said INA.
 
  “
  
    You intend on letting him live…?
  
  ”, asked the ochimusha. Nozomi, for whatever reason, was fixated on a nearby trash bin, oblivious to the conversation. 
 
  INA turned to the undead warrior. “
  What, and just end his suffering right here and now!? No! Maximize the pain!
  ”
   
 
  “
  Ooh, that’s downright nasty!
  ”, sneered Teto enthusiastically.
 
  “(
  
    Emile said to ‘Repel the darkness from within my heart’, and to ‘seal it away’... and this crazy ginger dude looks suspiciously like me… He seems to be buddy-buddy with 
  
  
    Teto
  
  
    , of all people, he lied to me about this confounded contraption, and now, he fucking kills Meachel?! Repeatedly bullying her for her speech patterns is fine and all, but I draw the line at 
  
  
    being stabbed!
  
   These fucks intend on hurting my friends…!)”, Ian internally monologued. He slowly picked himself back up. Unfortunately, it seemed Ian was late to that party, as Mikuchelle had already been bamboozled, stabbed, and subsequently cored again. 
 
  “NO! I won’t let that happen!”, Ian yelled! Even when it was all in futility, Ian kept on.
 
  “
  The fuck is his problem…?
  ”, said INA.
 
  “
  
    YOU, BITCH!
  
  ” 
 
  “
  Look, I clearly said there’s a waiting time on your waifu… and unlike
  
     someone
  
  ,
  ” INA sneered at Teto with that remark. She wasn’t terribly thrilled by that. “
  I’ll make sure she 
  
    actually
  
   likes you, okay?
  ”
 
  “Yer the fucker that sent that absolute PIT STAIN of a gremlin to Mason, arentcha!?”, Ian yelled.
 
  “
  You’re making a fool out of yourself again, do you know that, Ian? Do you ever take the time to 
  
    self-reflect
  
   and realize, it was 
  
    your own
  
   actions all along that have led you down this never ending path of suffering and despair. Your real friends left you long, long ago, at least the ones that weren’t from space! Your grades in school have suffered. Your ‘girlfriend’ only liked you because she had a gun to her head. Your own family has now abandoned you to die. And worst of all, your best and only friend, one Missus Miku Magdalen Hatsune, lied to you for YEARS because she
  
    AAK-
  
  ” Ian grabbed his doppelganger’s neck and started throttling, smashing his head into the side machine!! It sounded like the TF2 frying pan!
 
  Teto counterattacked, firing one of her drills at Ian! It grazed his arm!
 
  399!
 
  “GYAAAUUUH!!!” Ian whelped in pain like a dying puppy. Crimson blood stained the ground as he collapsed, writhing around like the mere bug he was. 
 
  The drill returned to Teto and snapped back in place.
 
  “
  Impressive.
  ”
 
  “
  I’ll finish him off! Just give me the-
  ” Teto was interrupted (how ironic, given her history).

  “
  THERE IS NO NEED TO DO SO!
  ”, INA roared. Ian was rolling around like a baby (and whimpering like one, too).
 
  INA Stooped over him, just like Yoshikage Kira to Hayato Kawajiri. Unfortunately for Ian, he was too busy bleeding to death to appreciate the funny JoJo reference.
 
  “
  Remember, your path of suffering never ends! We 
  
    are
  
   still in the Prologue after all…!
  ” INA turned around.
 
  “
  Now come, let us leave incompetent whelp to suffer, as we all laugh maniacally!! My master plan awaits!
  ” Another orange, seven-sided Door was opened up by INA.
 
  “
  TYAHAHAHA!!
  ” “
  Ohohohoh!
  ” The ochimusha remained silent, as did Nozomi.
 
  The four proceeded to enter the gate to parts unknown, with Nozomi lagging behind. She turned around for one last look at Ian, and thought about all of the terrible things he’d done to Eli, all in a montage set to the athletic theme from 
  
    Yoshi’s Island
  
  . 
 
  (Proceed to imagine the montage)
 
  Nozomi didn’t feel as bad about laughing at Ian anymore, sending off one final “
  Kuuhuuhuu…
  ” before stepping through.

      

      
  As Ian lay out bleeding, he had a nice view of the portal. Although The Other Side was occluded by dust and fog, light from another sun trickled through. It felt like a good place to die, but a thought passed through Ian’s nearly-empty head:
 
      
  “(
  
    Am I really gonna take this like a little bitch? After everything they’ve done? After everything I’ve done?)
  
  ” He remembered the words of Chuggaaconroy.
 
  “
  ... do what is right.
  ” “
  You must be the change.

 Even though he literally just had a dramatic flashback less than three minutes ago (brought to you by NordVPN), Ian found solace in the words of Let’s Play God. He yanked off his shirt (thankfully he was wearing a second, slightly smaller shirt underneath, God only knows no one would want to see what lies beneath) and tied it around his wound, just as he vaguely remembered from Boy Scouts. 
      
  “Aight. Step one: done. Good. Yeah.”

  Strangely, Ian felt like someone was watching him…
 
  The lid of the trash bin peeked open. A certain green-eyed astrologer who loves to sexually harass people peeked out. You may be asking, “How the fuck did she get in there, if she just left?” I don’t know, either.
 
  “
  Kuhuuhuuhuu… Well then! The big shot and his lovely assistant have already taken the bait… How considerate it was for Teto to leave her blueprints just lying around! And how nice as well for the drunk one to leave her tablet completely unprotected! Online nesoberi shopping has never been easier! It’s 
  
    laughable
  
   how those incompetent cretins ever thought that they could contain me! Now that they’ve taken the other one, it seems that the first step of 
  
    my
  
   master plan is also underway… 
  ”
 
  Unfortunately, Ian was facing the other way, and didn’t realize what the fuck was going on behind him. He glanced over his shoulder only to see the bin’s lid slamming shut. Aside from distant sirens, yelling, crystals crashing, and Ian’s own heartbeat, it was dead silent in the emptied parking lot. At least for now.
 
  “Whutever. Guess I’m just being paranoid. But that begs the question: what the hell is 
  
    step two…?
  
  ” He made a thinking face emoji, but in real life. (He was thinking.)
 
  “What would Joseph Joestar do?”, muttered Ian.
 
  A voice came from the bin. “
  Joseph Joestar would run away, just like the coward that you are!
  ”
 
  “Joseph Joestar would run the fuck away, just like the coward that- OI, I fucken’ heard that!”
 
  The bin yelped!
 
  “Wow! I’ve finally lost it due to an immense amount of trauma all crammed into one batshit day, from bein’ murdered, to meetin’ God, God callin’ me a little bitch, and now havin’ to fight this Teto-sympathizin’ ginger fuckboy! I oughta go home, lie down, and probably cry myself to sleep before comin’ up with step two!”, exclaimed Ian.
 
  And, by God, did he do exactly that. 
 
  “
  NIGERUNDAYO!
  ”, he shouted, running off into God-knows-what awaited him. Once the coast was finally clear, the trash bin lid flew open. It was Nozomi?!
 
  “
  One day, Eli-cchi… They may have you now, but one day, I’ll get my hands back on you! In more ways than one, I might add! Kuhuuhuu, Kuhuukaahaahaa!!!

  As dust, smoke, and strange orange light filled the sky, Ian, at long last, came upon the hill where his mother’s apartment was. Thankfully, none of the invading mamono had mobbed him like he’d seen happen to others, likely because they all thought he was unattractive. The Encyclopedia 
  
    did
  
   mention mamono tend to seek out partners “fit to preferences” first. It seemed Ian would be safe for a few days’ time (as long as he didn’t run into a filth-licking Akaname), but thoughts alone weren't enough to console him. He wondered if Michelle was doing okay, given recent circumstances, but the joke was on him: she’d presumed him dead and skipped town, coincidentally to the same place Michelle’s family was being sent. Hmm… Besides, there were worse things out there, like Nozomi.
 
  “But Michelle… er, Miku. Idunno. What 
  
    I
  
   do know’s that she ain’t gonna be happy to see me again! And yet, if she’s some kinda anime magical girl from TRAPPIST-1-fuckyou, clearly she’d be the one suited to stoppin’ this mess… 
  
    Oh, who’re ya kiddin’, Ian!
  
   She won’t even finish her gaddamn German homework! Even if Miku-chelle and her rainbow friends didn’t hate yer guts, it’s not like they’d ever be able to fix it…! Though, right now, what bugs me more is why weren’t any of ‘em color-coded back at the… laser portal thingy! Michelle’s s’posed to be blue or somethin’, right? She was blue at Olive Garden! Dammit, it’s too hard t’think about without bein’ over-caffeinated!”
 
  Ian noticed the trail of dried blood around his building. 
 
  “Fer fuck’s sake, y’d think corporate would’ve sent up a cleanin’ crew to deal with those meth-mouths upstairs!”
 
  Unfortunately, he noticed the trail led to 
  
    his
  
   apartment.
 
  “Oh. Oh no.”
 
  The door was busted down, the window in his bedroom was smashed, and the blood ended in a circular, burgundy smudge in the hallway, with little bits of something Ian didn’t want to think about littered in the outer rims of it.
 
  “
  OH.
  ” The events came back to Ian.
 
  “(
  
    Last night…
  
   What happened?)”, he muttered, despite knowing damn well what happened… at least to a point. Ian carefully stepped over the gross mess and went to his room, sitting down on the corner of the bed.
 
  “I was with Eli… She was trying t’tell me somethin’, but I figured it out, 
  
    way, way
  
   later than I should’ve… an’ Teto wasn’t gonna have any of that… (How’d she find out so quickly, anyways?) And apparently, Mr. and Mx. Kagamine weren’t havin’ it either. What’s their problem? I tried usin’ that crazy saw thing Neru gave me, took Lil’ Bow down, and Lil’ Pineapple 
  
    REALLY
  
   didn’t like that… and then ev’rything that’s supposed to be in my head went 
  
    out
  
   of it.”
 
  “Come t’think of it, shouldn’t that saw still be somewhere around here? I mean, I could probably out tha hurt that crazy ginger guy with it. That’s what Chuggaaconroy said t’do, right?” Ian got up and searched the empty apartment. To his dismay, the saw was gone. 
 
  “I mean, I guess it makes sense. Lil’ Pineapple probably took it after he rattled m’noggin nice n’good. Welp, there goes that option!” He layed back upon the bed, sighing.
 
  “Well, what the hell are ya gonna do now, Ian? Ya just gonna lie down here and wait for an Ushi-Oni to tear ya ta bits? That’s not how I wanna go out… I wanted to go out surrounded by loved ones n’ friends… but UNFORTUNATELY due to my bein’ an incelly prick, they’ve all left. Ah, I’d be lucky if I get thrown in the trash at this rate! Serves me right…!” He rolled over, pounding the mattress with his hands. 
 
  “Dammit! Dammit! Dammit! Dammit! DAMMIT!” Tears streamed down his face, as he continued.
 
  “WHY’D I DO IT?! WHY’D I SAY YES TO THAT IMPETULANT LITTLE GREMLIN!? 
  
    WHY!?!?
  
   THAT QUARTER-GOPNIK ASS WASN’T WORTH IT!! SHE ALWAYS HATED ME!! ALWAYS DID, N’ ALWAYS WILL!!”
 
  Ian was bawling.
 
  “WAS IT WORTH LOSIN’ MY FRIENDS!? MY FAMILY!? FOR 
  NOTHIN’ AT ALL
  
    !?
  
  ”
 
  He knew the answer at the very bottom of his heart (Although by now, it really didn’t seem like he ever had one.), that the answer was “No, never.” No amount of being yelled at, or even being hit with a wet fish by the Let’s Play God Himself, would surmount the regret Ian felt for being a hygy bastard. 
 
  He himself was powerless to end the chaos, and the only ones who could do so wanted him dead. Even if they got over themselves, Ian had done a mighty fine job of depowering them! His other friends cut off all contact long ago. His family had grown increasingly suspicious of him and his “companion”, and they likely weren’t going to come back. All hope was seemingly lost for this greasy, greasy man, all until a strange warbling sound emanated from the hallway.

  “
  SUTA PURACHINA: ZA WARUDO!!
  ”
 
  Ian rolled over, and beheld a sight he never thought he would see. There in the doorway stood an absolutely STACKED man, wearing white khakis, a lab coat, and a hat that seemingly melted into his hair. Ian recognized him, none other than the great--
 
  “J-J-Jotaro Kujo!?!”, Ian whelped. The eponymous Joe Joe of the Joe Joe Bizarre Adventure Show tipped his hat and sighed.
 
  “
  Yare Yare Daze…  It’s taken you finally long enough to notice me…
  ”, muttered the Stardust Crusader.
 
  “HOW!? YOU’RE NOT A VOCALOID, NOR A SUKUURU AIDORU! IS 
  
    ALL
  
   ANIME REAL NOW!? AM I GONNA LOOK OUTSIDE AN’ SEE MOTHAFUCKIN’ KAGYUA SHINOMIYA!?”
 
  “
  Unfortunately, no. I’m just a manifestation of your subconscious. I’ve been trying to knock some sense into you since day one, but you never seemingly noticed until now.
  ” Okay. Maybe it wasn’t 
  
    really
  
   Jotaro. (Pensive emoji.)
 
  “Good, ‘cuz if I ever saw Kaguya in real life, I’d probably cry,” said Ian.
 
  “
  Just goes to show why I’ve had to make myself known…
  ”
 
  “Isn’t it yourself? Ourself?” “
  
    YAKAMASHII!
  
  ” “oh, okay” 
 
  “
  Since you haven’t listened to your parents, your 
  
    actual
  
   friends, or even Let’s Play God Himself, it seems that 
  
    anime
  
   is the only way anyone will ever get your attention… And even then, I have doubts..
  ”
 
  The experience was strange to Ian. Was he really talking to himself? What was this thing before him?
 
  “oh.” “‘
  Oh?’ Is that all you have to say for yourself, Ian?
  ” “It’s just that Jotaro usually solves ‘s conflicts by punchin’ people in the face really, really quickly. I ain’t used to seein’ him like this.”
 
  “
  Oh, believe me, given your conduct, I 
  
    want
  
   to do that…
  ”, said “Jotaro”, “
  but unfortunately, that’d kill us both. And also I’m not corporeal, so any face-punching on my part wouldn’t be effective… But that’s precisely where you come in!
  ”
 
  “Oh?”
 
  “
  Like that punny guy from Minecraft said, 
  
    you’re
  
   gonna be the change.
  ”
 
  “But this is 
  
    Miku
  
  Lore? How’m I the protagonist?”
 
  “
  Because you have to change to be the change, and 
  
    she’s
  
   far more concerned with watching 
  
    Precure
  
  . That, and IB.
  ”
 
  “Glad I never signed up for that!”, retorted Ian. 
 
  “
  Anyhow,
  ” “Jotaro” pointed towards the closet. “
  There's something you need in there. Something you need to give to Miku.
  ”
 
  “Right that’s where I put ‘er birthday present! OH, SHIT, TODAY WAS HER BIRTHDAY!
  
     And I never showed ever up to her party!
  
  ”.
 
  “
  Yeah… about that… Well, I’m sure she wouldn’t mind a belated birthday present. Ian! You have to give Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition to her, it’s the only damn way things will be set right!
  ”
 
  “But how?” “I
  t’d be a nice start to be back on better terms with them. If the Magical Gay Anime Space Robots are still pissed at you, they’d be the last thing either of us would want to deal with going foreward.
  ”
 
  “My God… you’re right.” 
  “Good grief! Of course I’m right, bitch, I’ve been yelling at you for years to get your shit together and you never listened to me until I turned into some marine biologist with PTSDio!
  ” 
 
  Ian attempted to roll himself out of bed in order to retrieve the oh-so fabled Action JRPG (with Melia in it), but found himself unable to move.
 
  “NANI!? AGAIN!?” 
 
  “
  That’s just because you’re still asleep, dumbass! Now, wake up! You’ve got a world to save, Ian!
  ”
 
  “
  
    Ooooooooh shi-
  
  ”

  
  
  

  Ian awoke with a “hrfgfdgsfzfl…”, as one does. Apparently, he had cried himself to sleep, as his face was still wet, hopefully with tears. His left arm still hurt from earlier. Ian glanced outside and noticed it was dark.
 
  Looking over at his alarm clock, it said “1:12”, give or take a minute. Technically, it was tomorrow, even though it didn’t really feel like it. Ian felt a strange sort of resolve.

  “I’m… gonna do it!” The question lingered: And do what, exactly?
 
  “I’m gonna… save the goddamn world!” The question lingered: How do you plan on doing that?
 
  “I’m gonna make amends with Michelle… and then I gotta punch that ginger that thought ‘e was hot shit! OH, apologize to Eli at some point, I guess.” The question lingered: Why?
 
  “I gotta do it for her! For my mom! For my brother! For Michelle! For Jake! For Matthew! For Eli! 
  
    For Chuggaaconroy…
  
  ” Ian shot up and grabbed the game out of the closet. Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition, a legendary JRPG for the Nintendo Switch. Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition was, at least to Miku, 
  
    the holy ground, holy scripture, the origin of life equivalent to the universe
  
  , and probably the only thing she cared about on this godforsaken planet! Giving this as a gift to her would 
  
    surely
  
   make up for trying to kill her with a chainsaw!
 
  The game was wrapped up nicely in turquoise wrapping paper with a cyan bow. Ian had meant to give it to Michelle yesterday, but unfortunately for the two of them things just didn’t work out like that. 
 
      
  “Just like Jotaro said, I’m sure she wouldn’t mind a belated present… especially… THIS! GYEHAHAHA!” Ian said, yeeting the game into a duffel bag. He grabbed a few days’ changes of clothes, his wallet,  phone,  laptop, assorted toiletries, and of course, snacks; all crammed haphazardly into the duffel. Ian felt like he forgot something, however… 
 
      
  “Neso…?” He then realized that Eli had left him, presumably for good. 
 
      
  “Ah, I don’t blame her. I’d dump me, too.” He then realized what he was 
  
    actually
  
   missing, and opened up his sock drawer.
 
      
  “So the ginger has The Monster Girl Encyclopedia, does he? Well then, Geh huh hah…” Ian pulled out a strange, dark blue book.
 
      
  “Will he and his minions fare so well against… The Monster Girl Encyclopedia… 
  
    2!?
  
  ” Yes, Monster Girl Encyclopedia 
  2
  ! Unfortunately, Kenko Cross made a second one, no one really knows why.
 
  “If he’s usin’ the first one to control ‘em, then 
  
    clearly
  
  , the second one will un-control ‘em! Gehahahaha! Ah’m too damn smart!” He put the second volume underneath his right arm, and grabbed the duffel bag with his free hand.
 
  Ian had a long night ahead of him. After all, per the words of Chuggaaconroy, he was to be the change. Ian may have ruined everything, but now, it was time to un-ruin everything. All thanks to a 2020 Switch remake of a 2010 Wii game (which had Melia in it).
 
  Ian, duffel bag ‘o supplies in tow, walked out of the door to the apartment and down the hill.
 
  He needed to go and see his friend.
