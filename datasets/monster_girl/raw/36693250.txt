    Chapter Text
    Izuku Stared at the hazy sky above her, the hit from the sludge villain had knocked her so hard ,she didn't even feel the pain, just a vague warmness around her head and the sounds of someone shouting, or was it her own ears ringing? she couldn't really tell the difference anymore, nor could she remember where she was or why she was laying on the ground. Attempting to recall it, her mind was cast back far farther than she wished.Once again she was in the doctors office receiving the news that she, a young girl wanting nothing more than to be a hero, was quirkless. then her mind raced to that day in the creek, how angry Kachan had been when she tried to help him up when he'd taken a tumble, her young mind not understanding what she had did wrong. Trying to bring herself to remember more recent things brought her to middle school, with her body developing faster than the other girls and the chest that came with it, bountiful and bouncy. The taunting and mocking of the other girls for her chest size, and the looming looks some boys cast at her when she walked down the hallway. Snagging on what felt like a loose thread of memory, she finally began to recall today, the announcement of choosing a high school to enter, the thumping in her chest as her stubborn wish was made known for all to see, and laugh at. The stinging tears prickling at her eyes at Kachan burnt her books on hero analysis. The hollow feeling in her chest as she wandered after school trying to find some way, or reason, to continue chasing her dream. Finally she arrived at what truly brought her to her current state, the sludge villain wrapped around Kachan, suffocating him while he tried in vein to blow him away with his amazing quirk like he'd always known he could, and the panic at realizing it wasn't working. shown to her when he cast around with the desperate look of someone hoping someone would save them "oh, that's right, i tried to save Kachan", thought midoriya, as she lay there, dyeing on the side of a building after being smashed into it, her thoughts dull and tired, as her eyes cast over to where the sludge villain had been, she saw her hero Allmight stepping in, and with a mighty swing, blasting the villain away, her heart gave out one last beat of relief as she closed her eyes, glad that at least Kachan had been saved. Her consciousness then drifted off completely. ---midoriya felt as though she slept for a long time, voices drifting through her head, before one clear tone  cut through her unconscious mind, and she found herself laying in a void. She tried to speak, to ask the panic questioned that welled up inside of her, but she felt her voice only able to eek out, her chest not having the strength to heave the nessacary oxygen into her lungs to make speaking possible, her attention was soon drawn to two figures sat in front of her. An elegant woman in with silvery white hair, and wearing a dress to match, and behind her a man who reminded midoriya of All might in his stature, Though he was covered head to toe in intimidating armor. He was the first to speak, "it was brave what you did, it's only a shame it ended like this", his voice had a tinge of sadness to it, the woman meanwhile, held a somewhat mischievous smile. When she spoke, Izuku felt light in her heart, as though all of her troubles would melt away if she listened for long enough, "My husband happened to watch your final moments by chance, and he has...persuaded me to offer you a second chance at life as it were, but my power is not infinite, and to accept this will mean you must accept some...caveats". Judging by the way the man behind her reached forward and massaged the woman's shoulder with his large, firm hands, and the obvious delight she took from this even Izuku (who had never had a boyfriend before, or even someone admit they liked her) could tell what that convincing was and her cheeks flushed, which only seemed to amuse the woman in white as she stood up, and made her way over to where Izuku laid, kneeling down to her and holding her cheekshe caressed Izukus cheek with a gentleness that reminded her of her mother, "I will make it simple, become my emissary in your world, and I shall return you to life, in a beautiful form shaped around your hearts desire. But be warned, you will attract no shortage of attention from this, you will struggle, and you will no longer be human. But you will be strong, knowing all of this, will you accept my offer?" from deep within Izukus chest a powerful feeling arose, it was almost rage like in its intensity. Her words had stirred something long buried in Izuku, a desire for power, the power to help others. She gazed up at the smiling woman in white and gave a small nod, the rising feeling in her chest allowing her to find the strength to push herself up and eek out the words, "I want to be strong, strong enough to protect people". The lady in whites elegant smile split into an eager grin as she nodded, "A fine answer, backed with fire in your soul, yes, you are a good find indeed..." without hesitation, she brought her index finger to her mouth, where with her sharp incisors, she bite into the soft flesh of her finger until crimson blood began dripping from it, then holding it out to midoriya, giving her a simple command, "Drink this"midoriya was stunned for a moment, both from the sight of the blood, and her very unusual request. her confused eyes switched from the woman in white finger and back to her a few times, before she finally opened her mouth and extended her tongue towards the finger. The moment her tongue met the blood she felt as through her body was on fire. She felt able to move for the first time since she had awaken in the strange void. the fire spread down midoriya throat and through her chest, into her arms, which reached across her chest as if trying to grab the burning sensation and halt it, But it would not stop as it spread downward, through her hips, into her waist and down to her legs where it concentrated in her loins. The burning sensation felt tingling there between her legs, almost good, and her hands went down to feel it.Midoriya could feel the steaming heat coming from between her legs, her thighs and legs impotently rubbing together in hope of relief as she writhed on the ground, moaning obscenely, gasping for air as though she couldn't breath, all the while the woman in white watched on with a contented smile. As the burning sensation got more and more intense, midoriya felt below her hips was a pooling viscous liquid, most likely coming from her now completely soaked panties. Midoriya began to lose consciousness once again, fading as her body twitched and shuddered. The last words she heard were once again from the armored man, saying "you've got a second chance now, make the most of it", and with that, midoriya exited the void, her voice crying out in pleasure as her body was wracked with a pleasure she had never dreamed of before.---When midoriya awoke again, her surroundings this time were much more familiar. The white walls around her, the clinical smell of medical alcohol and the bed she was laying in with the rails on either side. Midoriya had awoken in a hospital. Though it appeared as though she had a visitorSitting on the hospital bed railing was what could at first be seen as a child, but a few things didn't fit. For one, though she was small her body wasn't child-like, her arms and legs, torso and head all seemed more "adult", she was naked except for the frilly ribbons and bows that crossed around her arms, chest and a see-through skirt on her hips that, while leaving very little to the imagination, did allow her to keep a small modicum of modesty to her. her hair was short and straddling the line between being cute and tomboyish. The most outstanding features though were her purple horns and tail. the tail twirled and circled behind her hips and ended in a heart shape. while her horns curved upwards from her head and were completely smooth. as soon as the little visitor took notice of midoriyas open (and staring) eyes, Her own lit up with excitement as she seemed to float up into the air and spread her arms like a cheerleader, "hiya! and congratulations-" she quickly dug around inside of a heart shaped bag attached to the ribbons wrapping around her waist, pulling out a stack of little cards and searching through them for a hot second before pulling one out and reading it aloud, "-Izuku Midoriya! you have been chosen to act as our grand and impeccable mistresses first step into spreading the word of love and acceptance for all in this world!" she then pulled out a party popper from that same pouch and pulled it, showering midoriya in confetti that disappeared a few seconds after it exploded, all the while she sat there dumbfounded and confused, only offering up an "eh?" before the little girl continued on, reading from her next card in the stack, "through your life you will bring many into your embrace and thanks to your new body, they shall become something like you, but not exactly like you, this includes both men AND women! so feel free to spread the love to whomever you wish-"Izuku tried to raise her arms to catch the little girls attention and politely ask her what she was talking about, but it was then that midoriya noticed something odd about her arm, not only was it much longer than before and rippled with muscles, but it was a shade darker as well not unlike a good deep tan! while she brought her other arm forward to confirm that they were the same, the little girl continued reading from her cards, not even noticing the predicament Izuku now faced, "-based on the wish in your heart for strength and to protect others our wise mistress has granted you the body of a high orc! their fearsome might and bravery inspires all those who fight under them to perilous heights of power and conquest and so it is her hope that it will serve you well in becoming a hero!" she then tucked the cards back into her little pouch and floated in the air, tucking her legs to her chest and hugging them as she floated there, resting her head on her knees and beaming at Izuku as if waiting for praise, "and that just about covers it! any questions?"To say Izuku would have questions would be like saying the ocean was big or Bakugou had issues, a slight understatement, "I- who- WHA-" each stammering statement only built on midoriyas rapidly flustering mind. looking between her hands, the floating girl in front of her, and the hospital around her in something of a daze before one clear question cut through her confusion with its need to be answered, looking back at the little girl she asked, "who are you?" as her eyes went then to her tail and horns, old habits kicked in next with her now rebooting brain, with the next question being, "what kind of quirk is that?"the girl, who had up until now been floating round in idle circles like a seal, turned in attention to midoriyas question, pointing at herself and speaking with the grandiose tone would would expect from a duchess to say, "I am the personally chosen imp by my grand lord and mistress to oversee you in this world and advise you! you can thank her infinite kindness for sending me down in particular-" though midoriyas second question seemed to halt her line of thinking, as she moved from floating with her legs to her chest, to then seemingly laying on thin air, pushing up her cheeks with her wrists as she said, "quirks? oooooh right right, those funny things human have in this world, don't got one! this is aaaaaaaaaall me!" she would then shoot up, bringing her fists to her hips and posing up a storm as she whirled around. A few things stuck out in midoriyas mind such as her referring to humans as separate, as well as that "this world" comment, pouncing upon this and now leaning forward with her hands in her lap, she would meekly ask, "um, I'm sorry but, could you please explain what you mean by that? the uh, other world comment and, how you're apparently not human?"the girl ceased her incessant, and at times frankly indecent, posing, and turned to midoriya snickering, "oh what? didn't you listen to my cards? i explained all that" midoriyas blanking stare said all it needed too to the young girl as she groaned then, "uuuuuuuuuuuh, fine, okay here's the gist then" she would take out the cards she had read from earlier, this time throwing them haphazardly over her shoulder as she summarized each of them, "you've been chosen by a grand powerful and SEXY demon goddess from another world to spread her influence here by creating monster girls and incubi by having lots and lots of steamy, passion filled rutting with lots of people in exchange for the fact you're not a cadaver! simple and easy to understand! and my name is azzy!" she would say, to round out her mini rant and punctuate it by throwing the papers into the air dramatically.midoriya sat back and considered everything she had just been told, when she thought back she could remember so clearly everything, her detour, the slime villain, being slammed into that wall, the haziness afterward, and then the woman in white, the man in armor, and the deal she'd struck. she felt a tingle between her legs at the memory of the moment the woman in whites blood hit her tounge. Meanwhile azzy picked up her note-cards off of the floor now regretting having done something so theatrical she now had to pick up, but her finely honed senses for knowing when she was about to get caught came to her assistance a second before the door began to open, turning back to izuku then and putting her finger to her lips, "we'll talk later, for now, do me a super solid and don't say anything about this m'kay? m'kay, good talk champ!" she would then put her hands together and, with a quick muttering of words Izuku couldn't understand. Azzy vanished into thin air! For the 5th time in the past 20 minutes midoriya began to doubt her sanity as the door opened revealed a doctor with the quirk of two additional arms growing out of the side of his head enter.the 4 armed doctor was gazing at a clipboard as he entered, a clipboard he would somewhat carelessly drop as he noticed midoriya being awake. Thankfully the upper pair of arms swung down to catch the board before returning it to its rightful place in the lower arms as the doctor quickly strode over to midoriyas bedside and said, in a somewhat awed tone, "e-easy there, your body has undergone a massive change, we didn't expect you to be up so soon! how do you feel? are you nauseous? dizzy? hungry?" midoriya would turn to the doctor then, grateful for something that was finally normal and ask, "i, i feel fine but, how long was i asleep for?" the doctor would then step back and once again consult his clipboard, flipping through its pages before coming to the right one as he said, "about a week, you took a pretty nasty hit from a villain but, en route to the hospital your body suddenly, well, mutated" the doctor would gesture down to her body thenhearing the word "mutation" brought thoughts of heroes with mutation type quirks to midoriyas brain like the fierce wings of the winged hero hawks or the strong legs of the rabbit hero miruko and in doing so, now looked down at her own body in more detail, pulling back the covers to inspect it, her lower arms and legs were both covered in tufts of a thick fur that felt quite warm and almost resembled leggings and long gloves at a glance, not only that but her inspection also revealed the rest of her body now toned with tense muscle and definition, but it was also fuller and more rounded, where the muscle didn't show through as much there was soft inviting flesh there covered in perfect skin that was the same shade as her arms. this leaning forward also freed from her backside a tail, which now free from under her, she could feel and move, revealing it to be a short tail covered in small thin hairs, save for the tip from which thick and course fur burst out like a paintbrush. While midoriya looked through her new features the doctor continued consulting his all important chart, "we've never truly seen anything like it, a quirk activating so suddenly and then remaining active, our working theory is that you had a "phantom quirk", or otherwise known as a quirk whos activation requirements are obscure and unknown to the user, or the effect itself is only seen or felt under specific circumstances like "changing the color of milk on a Tuesday" or something like that" he would look up then with a kindly smile, "Whatever the case, you should thank your lucky stars, it saved your life"midoriya felt a wave of relief wash over her then, almost collapsing from it, surely that vision and the little girl were fake after all, they had probably put her on some form of medication while she was asleep, and what she saw when she woke up was just a hallucination or a waking dream. She simply had a quirk which only manifested now, that explanation struck and rung through her mind as the doctor directed her to try and stand to see how she was feeling. much to midoriyas surprise she was actually taller than the doctor! letting out a yelp of surprise at the fact as the doctor took a step back to be able to continue looking her in the eye, as she looked down in shock, looking down on an adult for perhaps the first time in her life (barring the elderly people bent over with age) midoriya would ask, pushing two of her finger together, "i-is there a mirror i could look into doctor?", without another word, the doctor gestured over to a door mirror that hung on the inside of her roomstepping in front of it the first thing midoriya noticed was her face, and her hair. While her face had remained largely as it had before, midoriya noticed the subtle changes. taken on their own they would be insubstantial, a slightly differently angled cheek, somewhat more turned down eyes. but all together they gave her face a sharpness that wasn't there before, it was no longer rounded like her mothers kindly face but more angled, more mature. the second change was her hair, now no longer the slight green she had known for all of her life but spiking out along the back of her heads and a silvery grey to boot. In a way her features reminded her of a wild boar. Along with her now vibrantly yellow eyes, midoriya could not shake the feeling that she had transformed into some kind of predator.---Over the next few days the staff at the hospital would run tests on midoriya, ensuring she was healthy and fit and, before long. she was discharged with a clean bill of health. It was the best week of midoriyas life, she had a quirk, her body felt strong, stronger than it'd ever been before. death arms, kamui woods and mount lady made a special visit to the hospital and apologized for the incident, during said visit midoriya spent most of her time telling them they didn't need to apologize. The only seeming downside now was midoriya always felt strangely hungry, of course she ate but that didn't seem to help, or rather like it was scratching the wrong itch. her day being released her mother had tearfully picked her up from the hospital, sobbing and crying hard enough to water the bushes in front of the hospital. Though this became a bit of a problem when she caused minor flooding in the lobby when she say midoriya being wheeled out in a chair. the subsequent explaining that this had been done simply out of procedure did help to calm her tears however, and the two spent the night at home. midoriyas mother had prepared a meal fit for 6 people for Izuku, said meal was all but gone by the end, and was immensely delicious to bootit was only afterward in the shower that midoriya would realize that strange hungry feeling from before was still there. she had puzzled out by now that it couldn't be for lack of food, she felt stuffed to the brim already, but gazing down at the water coursing down her body, along her sides and between the valley of what was now her massive chest, the answer suddenly became the most obvious thing in the world to midoriya, she hadn't touched herself in quite some time. leaning her head against the shower wall, she sent a hand down between her legs to amend this immediately and, as her fingers made first contact with her already warm and ready pussy, she felt them pressing into herself. What her fingers were met with was an almost alien feeling for midoriya, though she had explored her body before, often with the assistance of her vivid imagination helping her to envision all sorts of scenarios. this was different, her body FELT different, her exploring fingers felt as through they were pressing into a soft velvety carpet as she they slide in and out at an increasing speed. soon her top half was pressed against the shower wall to make up for the lack of support she was receiving from her shaking legs, bountiful soft breasts pressed against cold ceramic tile. her nipples standing on end as she rubbed her chest up and down against the smooth surface, harvesting every bit of pleasure that could from the sensation as her ass began to rise in the air, her probing fingers leading herself ever closer to orgasm as her other hand placed itself futilely on the wall trying to keep her up. an effort that would be completely shattered as midoriya pushed her fingers in as far as they would go, now moaning in a low but obscene tone she would fall to all fours in the shower as from inside of her came a strong orgasm, the liquid expulsion from between her legs being so forceful a large amount of it ended up on the shower wall with a wet splat. midoriya remained on the shower floor for only a moment of afterglow before her mother knocked on the door, her voice tinted with the overprotectiveness one would expect of a mother whos child had just been released from the hospital, "izuku sweetie? is everything okay in there?" midoriya quickly pulled herself up and shut off the water, stepping outside of the shower and quickly wrapping herself in a towel that could only barley contain her hips and chest without an inch spared. opening up the door to address her mother, izuku slide open the door just a tad to speak, "y-yeah mom, everything's fine, thank you" as she spoke, she could feel the last remnants of her pleasure from moments ago still oozing thickly from between her legs, hidden from view from her mother only by the thin towel and sliding door. with her daughters affirmations inko midoriya let out a sigh of relief, kneading her hands together in worry still, "thank goodness, well. don't spend too much time in there, its nearly time for bed okay hun?"  with a nod and an adjusting of the towel, midoriya would step outside of the bathroom then, moving towards her room swiftly, "okay mom, i was done anyway bathrooms all yours!" she would then quickly step into her room and close the door softly behind her, inko tilted her head in confusion and worry at her daughters oddly brisk behavior, but needing to shower herself. she would then step into the bathroom and prep it for her own shower. noting the oddly sweet smell in the air that made her feel strangely energeticOnce midoriya was in her room, she placed her back to the door and slowly slid down to the floor, bare cheeks touching the carpet as she let out a long sigh, letting the towel fall to look at her naked body once again, and at the needy ache she felt between her legs. fingering herself had helped a bit but she knew she needed more. making sure her door was locked and she heard the sounds of the shower once again being turned on, midoriya crossed her room over to her bed which now felt comically small for her. her legs could almost dangle off of the end while her head rested comfortably on her pillowshe sat there for a short while, reflecting on the urge that had overcome her body then, but like every itch, this one returned with a vengeance, asking to be satiated again. midoriya let out a groan of annoyance and, making sure she could still hear her mother showering, reached into the 3rd drawer of the nightstand beside her bed, on the surface this contained all of izukus old hero analysis books and spare all might merchandise that she couldn't put up around her room, of which there was already enough to fill a small museum, or perhaps a shrine would be more accurate, but underneath it was a shoebox, inside this shoebox were random newspaper clippings and a stack of empty letter envelopes, junk really, but finally underneath that was a small little "massage wand" that midoriya had bought, or rather been tricked into buying when she was twelve--Kachan had made midoriya carry his books from school as him and some of the clingers on that he sometimes surrounded himself with joked and laughed, all while midoriya struggled to keep up with 2 heavy backpacks on her front and back. when they passed in front of a rather adult store. the clingers on had chanted and dared for midoriya to go in and buy something for them. Not wishing to look like a coward in front of Kachan, she went inside and was exposed for the first time to a veritable cavalcade of adult merchandise. erotic hero figurines, magazines detailing the wardrobe slips of heroines. Even toys themed after certain hero's such as the "PLUS-ULTRA ALL MIGHT 14 INCHER TEST OF METTLE™". The sight of which both frightened izuku and had her intrigued but it was also more than 30'000 yen, way more than midoriya had in her tiny little purse. in fact most of the things in the shop were out of midoriyas price range save for a plain personal massager and a few magazines. So she decided to buy the massager on a whim.The cashier, a significantly older woman with dyed hair gelled into thick spikes that hung around her head like curtains, long fingers covered in rings and a nose piercing looked up from the tabloid magazine she was reading as midoriya set the massager down on the counter. as the cashier looked between it and izuku with the dead eyed look of most retail workers midoriya felt increasingly uncomfortable with her silence, speaking up in a slightly squeaky voice that hadn't quite caught up to her pubescent body, "i-ill just take this ma'am!". the woman took a long drag from a cigarette that had been dangling between those long fingers and spoke in a raspy tone that suggested she partook of them often, those same long fingers pointing out the window to Kachan and his cronies outside, "kid, those lil' shits dare ya ta come in here or wut?" midoriya distinctly remembered the cashiers deep Osakan accent as well, but to her question midoriya could only shyly shake her head and look down, the back of her neck and cheeks flaring up, the cashier let out a hum of thought and said, "get em all the time, come in here, talk big, but they dont know shit. probly sent ya in here cause they were too scared 'emselves" she let out a deep rasping chuckle as a kindness came into her eyes, pointing to a door in the back of the shop, "tell ya wut, go out that back and down the alley, 'at outta take ya away from those jackasses." she then slide the massager back towards midoriya, "keep this too, its small but its got a strong motor, you'll 'ppreciate it someday" her cackle then bellowed into a full on laugh not unlike a witches as she waved midoriya through to the backfaced with the prospect of walking out and facing kachan and his goons again, or simply leaving, midoriya picked option 2 and once outside of the shop. sprinted as hard and as fast as her legs would take her. only when she had arrived back home did she realize that she still had kachans backpack! she quickly ran upstairs to deposit her things, including the massage wand, before running back over to kachans house to return his things. in thanks he had only called her a spineless wimp before shutting the door in her face as she bowed profusely and in apology. returning home she knew she couldn't show her mother what she had gotten and instead stowed it away where it wouldn't be found. --now midoriya glanced at the little toy in her hand. since she had been gifted it, she'd used it to explore her body as she grew up, finding out what felt good when put where, and it had brought her many nights of peaceful sleep when it wouldn't come to her only through closing her eyes. midoriya spread her legs open while with the wand in one hand, she brought it down to poke and prod at her clitoris, which stood at attention to the wand, pressing up into it as midoriya felt her body heating up her other hand reached over to her nightstand. this time to retrieve her phone and find an appropriate video to go along with her self relief her browsing was brief as she spied a nice looking cosplay video, playing it showed a very well endowed woman of both chest and hips strutting around as none other than the R-rated hero midnight. These types of videos were rather common especially around her in particular. as she lounged on a couch, slowly moving her ass closer and farther from the camera in what could charitably be called stretching, midoriya flicked on the wand and bit her lip immediately as the quiet but quick hum of the wand filled her ears and its rotating end began spinning against her waiting clitmidoriya held the wand firmly in her hand, now large enough to hold the entire upper half in her palm while the tip poked out through her fingers, digging it against her crotch that quickly became slick and wet with her juices, midoriya became vaguely aware of a sweet scent that filled her room but continued on without taking much note of it, the video transitioned into having a rather muscular man in brief's, cock hard and pressing into the thin fabric, rubbing his hands over the thin breezy material  that covered midnights ass. pressing his clothed erection into her other cheek while the cosplayer giggled and turned around, revealing the thick rod of meat that stood with a slight curve near the endat the sight of it, midoriya began to drool. As she saw it she wanted it badly, a sensation so strong she momentarily stopped pressing the wand against her crotch as she stared at it with an almost predatory gaze. her mouth hung open and tounge flicked out to the screen where the tempting rod was shown. but midoriyas more sensible side re-asserted itself as she pulled her tounge back into her mouth, knowing the image on the screen wasn't the real thing and pondering what had come over her. it was then that she heard a sound from behind her phone screen. a sound that sent a chill up her spine and twisted her stomach into knots. that being the sound of a tapping at the window, which sat above her bed, giving a full and clear view of midoriya in her state of undress, wand in hand and juice staining the spot underneath her.in her need she had forgotten to draw the blinds to keep from this exact scenario from happening. midoriya slowly lowered her phone to peek out at the would be intruder, preparing all kinds of excuses and cover stories she could uses. but as her eyes drifted over to the window in dread she was met with a perplexing sight, that being of the young girl she had surely hallucinated at the hospital. Azzy floated outside the window now bearing various touristy items adorning her person, from a kamikaze headband to a T-shirt with the logo of Universal Studios Japan on it and a stick on which there was tricolor kibidango skewered. she pointed down to the latch on midoriyas window with her other hand, making an unlocking gesture. midoriya, blinking in confusion, slowly sat herself up and unlocked the window, at which point azzy pushed it open with her free hand, floated inside, and then pushed it closed again, giving midoriya a thumbs up, "thanks a whole bunch champ, i was worried i was gonna have to ring your doorbell!" she laughed then as she looked at midoriyas naked form, her lips curling in mischief, revealing her teeth underneath that were locked together, "did i interrupt?"midoriya, now realizing she was naked, brought her All Might Good Night Limited Edition Bodypillow™ and hugged it to her chest, also wrapping her legs around it to cover her lady bits, after covering up she would ask, "W-what are you doing here?! and, and" her eyes glanced over to the window, she had opened it, but she hadn't closed it, hallucinations didn't close windows, "how are you real?!", as she spoke she felt her world beginning to shift again. if the imp was real, then what she said would be true also and she had entered into a Faustian bargain for the body she now enjoyed.Azzys eyes rolled to the question, "oh come on champ, you're a smart one aintcha? i came here cause i thought you needed a few days to digest what i told you!" she then pointed her kibidango at midoriya like a sword, "and its time to get to work! by now your body's absolutely starved for semen!" her pointed kibidango drifted down to between midoriyas groin, "that itch you've got? you cant scratch it yourself, you need someone else for that, normally it'd just be a guy, but since you're supposed to usher in all kinds of mamono you're a bit of a special case, you can absorb it from girls too" azzy would then bring the kibidango to her mouth and take a bite from the first ball, chewing it for a few moments before swallowing, "but lucky for you, your amazing assistant azzy has scouted out the area and found the perfect place to go-a-hunting!" midoriya was silent for a few moments, looking between the headband and her shirt, midoriya shot back with, "You look like a tourist! have you really been doing that or just goofing off?!" she then stood up, beginning to pace around her room, both to work off the frustration she felt at her situation and not being able to finish what she had started, the need ache going even harder between her legs now. she quickly put on a pair of simple pink panties from her nightstands second drawer to cover her crotch at the very least, turning back around to azzy, "and, i don't need-" it was then that azzy cut her off, twirling her finger at midoriya in a knowing fashion, "don't need what? some nice hot company? a stud or mare to take care of you? well guess what~ you're wrooooooooooooooong~" she spoke in a gleeful almost singsong voice as she floated closer to midoriya, grinning then, "you want to complain and shoo me away? go ahead, cause if you do then you're gonna be reckoning with that new body of yours all alone, wondering why you cant control it, in a few days you'll go nuts and start sucking and licking anything you can get your hands on. now normally i wouldn't object to that but, my mistress told me I've got a mission!" her face then shifted from delight to seriousness, even being stern, "and im not gonna let it fail because you're not getting with the program, now throw on a jacket or something and follow me, I'm gonna teach you the basics!"azzy floated over to the window then, pushing it open and sitting on the windowsill with her legs crossed. seemingly waiting for midoriya who weighed her options silently, either she could go with the strange being and maybe learn more about what had happened to her, or stay in her room and resume. in the end her curiosity got the better of her and her inquisitive mind wouldn't let her rest until it got answers, opening her closet she found an old raincoat and through it on, tuning back to look at azzy only to find her leaving, saying "great! now that you've got a jacket lets go!" midoriya called out, "but-but, shoes!" she gestured down to her bare feet, but the flying imp was out of ear range reaching up to the sky in frustration, midoriya pushed the window open further and pursued azzy into the cold of the night in naught but an old raincoat and simple pink lacey panties to conceal her---Azzy lead midoriya through the streets and alleys of her familiar neighborhood into more and more unfamiliar territory, the buildings became rougher and more degraded, she began to spy litter on the ground and occasionally street artists spray painting the sides of buildings, all the while now beginning to shiver from the cold, though the fir around her shins and arms helped considerably, she followed the little imp, whispering harshly, "could you please tell me the reason you brought me to this part of town?!" said midoriya, the growing panic in her eyes becoming more and more apparent the longer she walked. strangely despite having walked what felt like miles, she felt no fatigue either in her breather or her legs which used to get shaky and jelly filled after gym class. azzy simply turned back around as the dup now found themselves in the middle of a park that had long been claimed by the area around it, benches covered in graffiti and trash were all around, and the remnants of trash fires of homeless men were seen but not the vagrants themselves. azzy turned back around to midoriya then and winked, saying in a voice of supreme excitement, "just you wait, aaaaaaaaany moment now" it was then that midoriya heard the crunching of leaves behind her, whirling around to see a man dressed in baggy jeans and a tattered hoodie approaching her, stubbly facial hair and a head topped with a beanie. he held a cigarette between his lips which he quickly threw on the ground as he grinned at midoriya, swaying from side to side with what he definitely thought was swagger, "well well well, you lost ladies? awful part of town to take a stroll through" he then produced a butterfly knife from her hoodies front pocket, pointing it at midoriya as he stretched his other hand out, "tell ya what, I'm a guide around here. why don't you hand over all of your cash and ill escort ya out" midoriya stood there for a moment before turning to where azzy floated next to her, "....this was your plan?". azzy then nodded, enthusiastically at that with a proud look on her face, midoriya continued to stare at her as she asked, "your plan was to drag me out in the middle of the night to get mugged?" once again, azzys head bobbed up and down with far more enthusiasm than was normal for this situation. midoriyas questions continued, as did her disbelief, "and, you're going to help me, right?" to this fairly reasonable question, azzy would snort and snicker, pointing at the mugger and saying, "against him? really? he's a total shrimp! you've got this champ!" giving midoriya a big thumbs up and an encouraging smile. midoriyas response was a curt but certain, "I'm going to die here"the mugger, who was getting gradually less and less patient, especially when azzy opened her mouth, then shouting, "hurry the fuck up and pay up, otherwise I'm gonna put this thing to use!" he slashed the knife through the air at the duo, his teeth gritted, midoriya held up her hands and began panicking, "i-i dont have any money! i swear!" she gave the mugger and imploring look, which was soundly ignored as he moved forward and grabbed her collar, having to reach up then as he held the knife in front of her face, "don't BS me bitch!  open up that jacket, lets see what's in your pockets! now!" being terrified and unable to even think of resisting, midoriya opened her jacket to the muggeras he beheld was was beneath the jacket, the muggers eyes bugged out as he saw midoriyas legs, her body, her chest, and also the fact she was mostly naked, he took a step back in surprise as his eyes blinked a few times, his eyes traveled up and down midoriyas effectively nude body  "yo, uh, i aint, i aint that kind of guy, i just, want your money" This situation was now beyond any the mugger had experienced in his long, if minor, criminal career. it was so shocking his former persona of intimidation fell away! midoriya felt a sting in her heart as she saw the assumption in the muggers eyes, crying out in indignation "im not a pervert!" while she stood there mostly naked.the mugger then pointed his knife again, re-asserting himself as he began to back away, "don't, don't you fuckin, shout at, me" he began to shake his head as he stumbled in place, midoriyas body had become drenched in cold sweat from the nervousness of the situation, and from it came a sweet scent, this same sweet scent the mugger had gotten a full frontal point blank blast of as he forced midoriyas coat open. now that smell invaded his brain and his body, he felt dizzy and hazy. his cock was going wild in his pants and he began to pant. while still trying to maintain control he pointed the knife at midoriya, shouting once again "you're the, godamm weirdo, walking around at night, in that perfume of yours!" as he shouted again, midoriyas eyes began to prickle with tears, meanwhile at her side her hands balled into fists. she had been rudely interrupted from her personal time, dragged halfway across the city and had been mugged and now accused of perversion. inside of her there built a deep and strong feeling of anger, she had never asked for this. to make things worse, it had come just after she'd had the best few days of her life. These feelings bubbled together in a rolling pit of anger, and as she laid her eyes on the mugger, now backing away from her with his legs trembling, her eyes trailed down to his groin. She had seen diagrams of cocks in science class, and many times touched herself while watching porn. But now in front of her there was the real thing. justifications began to build in her mind as she stepped forward to the mugger, ignoring his warnings and shouts, thoughts like, "maybe if i do it, he wont tell anyone", or "there's no one around anyway, what's the harm?", and finally, "he tried to mug me, he's probably mugged people before, maybe if i do this, he'll stop". they were all flimsy, but they were enough that when midoriya cornered him against a tree, she felt no sense of guilt in her heart as she slammed her hands on either side of the trees bark. her farm hands imprinting themselves into it. the mugger let out a yelp of surprise and, in desperation, swung his knife into midoriyas side. What he wasn't expecting was for it to break and shatter against her skin like glass. the area that had been soft and supple a moment ago now looked as firm and toned as steel, before going back to being soft, all while he beheld the sight in front of him, a woman of prodigious size with her raincoat open to him. trapped on either side by her arms as he was forced to breathe in the almost chokingly sweet scent that muddied his mind. all while she spoke with clarity and certainty that wasn't there even a minute ago, "I'm going to fuck you, now" it wasn't a threat, but certaintythe first thing midoriya dig with the cowed mugger was bring her lips to his, her strong hand wrapped around the back of his head and brought it to hers. She pressed her lips into his and her tounge invades his mouth, wrapping around and pressing into his tounge, his other hand tried to beat at her shoulder but it lost strength quickly as he felt his body turning to jelly as he was lifted up. midoriyas other hand soon went around his waist, pressing his body into hers as she felt him up. her free hand traveling under his hoodie and feeling out his body. sending shivers up his spine with every spot they touched. when midoriya finally brought her head back, the mugger panted for air, but any hope for relief was dashed as he was dropped down to his knees, as midoriya stood over him. she took a power stance and pointed between her legs where her crotch lay, wet and ready for action she took a right step closer to the mugger, pressing him between the bark of the tree and her dripping pussy, his face pressed into her he had almost no way of breathing, and even when he did the gulps of air he took were humid and warm, and brought no clarity to his head as midoriya spoke a command, "lick me" and it was so, as the mugger heard those words he stopped trying to get out and instead embraced the fleshy prison he was now forced against, his arms reaching around to press into the bronzed cheeks he was now a slave too, all while soft moans escaped midoriyas lipsfrom above and looking down, midoriya reached a hand over her breast and begin to pull and pinch at the nipple there, tugging on it as she watched the mugger beneath her trying desperately to lap and lick at her, she felt a deep sense of satisfaction looking down at him like that. when moments ago he had been being so forceful he was now tame in her hands, doing as she pleased. now she was the one in power. her body had hardened reflexively to his feeble attack, and it was at that moment a revelation shot through midoriyas mind, "im strong", for perhaps the first time in her life she had thought that, and now she would put that strength to use, turning to azzy then. she had been floating a few feet away but now watched Izukus complete domination of the situation while her finger stroked up and down her own groin, wanting a piece. izuku spoke and broke her out of her daydreaming, pointing down to his pants then, "get them off" before returning her attention to the mugger, who she now held by the hair and rubbed up and down her groin, and having his rabid, reaching tounge lick where she wanted.  azzy gave a salute and got to work on the order, first unbuttoning the pants and then dragging them down, having to yank them off inch by inch until they rested at his ankles, from there the only obstacle were his briefs, against which his throbbing cock pressed upward straight as a flagpole, and the tip of which was so wet and leaking it made a noticeable stain on his underwear. azzy felt the temptation strongly but, feeling the eyes of the new predatory izuku on her, she complied with the order and yanked down his briefs as well, contenting herself with lapping up the precum that now stained the inside of the briefswith somewhat carelessness midoriya stepped back from the mugger, as he continued to lick the air in front of him and his eyes glazed as if he was drunk, midoriya then picked him up by the hood of his hoodie and dragged him around so his head lay at the foot of the tree and his legs and hips pressed against it, pointing upward. its then that midoriya took a squatting position over his face, her hands resting on her knees, they then slid down to her hips and removed her now soaking panties, sliding then off one leg at a time and slamming them over his head so his vision was completely obscured by their laces, and the front end where he had been licking now covered his nose. from there she returned to her original position as his hips twitched and thrusted impotently into the air. midoriya watched him for a few moments  before then pressing her hips down into his face. she felt his nose digging against her asshole but that just made her lean back more, his nose being cut off left only his mouth to breath, which was now mostly buried under midoriyas exposed pussy. the order didn't even need to be given before he began licking, at which point midoriya set her eyes on her true prize, his cock, it was of decent size and thickness before, but now it stood engorged, seemingly having grown ever so slightly bigger since having his briefs taken offmidoriyas yellow eyes fixated on it for only a moment before she grabbed his legs and pulled them forward, now being pressed against either of his sides, his hips were now tipped unescapably forward and his cock defenseless to the hungry mouth of midoriya, she swallowed it whole in one go, its tip poking at the back of her throat. her sucking lips got to work immediately, practically making  a vacuum seal as midoriya bobbed her head forward and back along his cock, funneling her tounge like a fuck tunnel. the cock was guided into her throat each time as he slide along her tounge. one arm wrapped around his legs and waist, keeping them raised, while her other hand went to his backside, raising up before coming down in hard and firm spanks. moving from each to cheeks with each resounding slap she felt his cock twitching.the mugger, now trapped beneath midoriya, felt as though he might pass out at any moment. but his tounge did not stop licking. the sweet scent had completely absorbed his thoughts and now, all he thought of was getting more of it. he licked like midoriyas pussy was the most delicious thing he had ever tasted, and when he tounge found her clit. he sucked as though his life depended on it, which above him, midoriya felt and switched from spanking his cheeks to pressing them forward, providing his cock no escape or relief as she now twirled her tounge around its length. he was the first to give out as the biggest orgasm of his life rocked his body, shooting cup after cup of essence rich cum into midoriyas mouth. the flood of juice into her mouth tasted creamy and sweet to midoriya, swallowing it as quickly as it came, her own hips began grinding against the muggers face. he had stopped from his mind shattering orgasm but midoriya, being so close to her own, wasn't going to stop for anything then, as the last droplet of cum was sent down her throat, she lifted her hips up just a tad before pushing them back down with force. pressing the muggers face so hard into her hips it might as well have left an imprint against the ground, midoriya finally came, drenching the muggers face, and parts of his body. in thick slimey fluid. Midoriya let his hips fall then, sitting up and then shakily standing over her drained prey, she examined him from top to bottom as her body bathed in the pleasure of the moment. the mugger was reduced to a twitching unconscious mess, his face was sloppy with midoriyas girl-cum. his expression one of utter dazed pleasure. while below his waist his cock had shrunk down significantly, seemingly having blown everything into midoriyas mouth. Midoriya stood over him as if admiring the work she had done before she then realized, the gradually building hunger she had felt had disappeared. she felt a lightness in her step and chest as if just waking up from a short but well needed nap. she was alert and, in her surrounding, she followed the sounds of fingers sliding into wetness as she looked at azzy, rubbing the pre-cum stained briefs of the mugger against her pussy before giving herself her own orgasm, albeit less extreme than midoriyas, she tossed the now soiled underwear over the crotch of the defeated mugger and floated over to midoriya, giving the "okay" sign and grinning. a smile midoriya actually returned as the two stood, the monstrous needs of both now satisfied The pair departed wordlessly from the site soon after that, walking the rest of the way with her front open. azzy lead them both through back alleys and empty streets where neither were spotted, and once back inside of her room, midoriya climbed back in through the window she had left open, azzy fluttered down onto the nightstand, stretching as midoriya closed the window and lay on her bed, now tired, meanwhile azzy slide into the second drawer of the nightstand and made herself a bed from the panties therein, drawn to their apparent softness. with this the two fell asleep---it was the following morning when midoriya awoke, she stared up at the ceiling for a moment, before her eyes then shot open and peered around her room, landing on the discard rain jacket in front of her window, and the sleeping azzy in her nightstand drawer, the events of the last night came rushing back to her as she held the sides of her face. she had fucked someone, hard. not only that but she'd had his cock! in her mouth! she could run her tounge up and down and recall its shape, the feel of its head and- she pulled herself from this train of thought as she felt it beginning to ignite a new ache in her groin. Taking a shower, midoriya could not get the events out of her head, what she did felt so, unlike her it was startling, and yet she remembered her hands reaching out the mugger, pushing in down, everything. it all felt so surreal, but the lingering salty taste in her mouth told her it was real, that and when she finished showering, dressed herself and walked out to see her mother watching the news with a cup of coffee. the news story covering it only further cemented it in reality for midoriya. seeing a reporter at the site of her crime speaking to the cameras in a very serious tone, "the man was found half naked and covered in very lurid fluid, when he awoke he said he could not recall any event beyond having approached a woman, and everything after that being a blur, the police are still looking into this odd crime and we will keep you posted as updates become available" midoriya breathed a sigh of relief then as she sat down for breakfast with her mother. the two talked quite normally, about their plans for the day, about what they would eat for dinner that night. but the pleasant morning was soon shattered by the barging in of an unexpected guest.She was dressed in a bathrobe which concealed her sleeping clothes underneath, her hair was a mess of ash-blonde hair that ended in spikes very familiar to both izuku and inko by now. standing in the doorway panting and clearly in distress was the mother of the boy midoriya felt both affection and dread for Mitsuki Bakugou, her normally sharp eyed filled with terror as she shouted, "inko! have you seen my son?!"The elder midoriya shook her head and crossed over to mitsuki worriedly, "What?! no i haven't, what happened?!" inko ushered the panicking mitsuki into the kitchen, where she presented inko with a sheet of paper. on which the message was, short, concise and hand written. the words that had thrown Mitsuki's world around in a single morning were as follows"mom, i cant become a hero, i need to leave, don't come after me, katsuki" 
  
    Chapter Text
    The morning after midoriya had sexually assaulted a man was filled with talking to the police. Though not for her arrest as midoriya had feared after the hunger that dwells inside of her had momentarily taken over. Rather she gave all accounts and knowledge she knew on where Kachan could be. The people he hung out with, the places he liked to go to think, some of his favorite hobby stores, all of which midoriya was able to provide with only some suspicious looks from the cops. Mitsuki bakugou was practically a mess, a far cry from the cheerful and assertively loud woman midoriya had known since she was a child. Inko quickly threw on her coat to help escort her back home leaving midoriya alone in the house once againShe made her way upstairs after taking a moment to clear and clean the table of what they'd had for breakfast and cleaning off the plates. When she arrived in her room again she found Azzy, her self proclaimed assistant, now floating around midoriyas desk and admiring the full sizes all might figurines there, given her own size was barley larger than that of a large doll she Fit in quite well with the figurines. Midoriya shut the door behind her which drew the attention of the curious imp, who floated up and said, with a great mischievous smile, "morning champ! how ya feeling? good? ill bet its good, you absolutely porked that guy last night! i thought he'd at least be bale to last another round though" the imp let out a shrug before floating over to midoriya, "but man! you were a natural! cant wait to see how you handle the next stud" midoriya let out a great heaving groan as she crossed over to her bed and sat down, staring at the floor then, "do i have too? i mean, it did feel good but...." her voice trailed off then, her mind trying to find a reason to match her morals with her body, then looking up at azzy, "okay, so, if i understand this correctly, since my body has changed I've got this, "hunger", now, and it can only be satisfied with, well, sex" she would cross over to her desk and pull out a new notebook and pen, labeling this one "Body Analysis 1" on the front before opening to the first page, "what will happen if i do, have sex" she spoke of the word with the same hesitance one would have trying to avoid a curse word in front of their grandma, while azzy remained with her grin in the air, "oh! then you'll probably lose control of your body and go on a mating spree until you've had your fill". Following these words was a prolonged scribbling in the fresh notebook as midoriya began taking notes, pacing in her room as she did so, turning to azzy and pointing her pencil at her as she threw out her next question, "do you know what this body can do? you mentioned something about a "high orc" back in the hospital, did you mean an orc like from one of those fantasy games?" the image that came to midoriyas mind first was of a hulking green skinned man in a loincloth, yet glancing at herself in the mirror, she saw only the gentle curves of her body from head to toe. Azzy rolled her eyes to midoriyas statement and reached into her heart-shaped hip bag and produced a large leather-bound tome, the front of which had the world "The Monster girl Encyclopedia, by The Wandering Scholar." and flipped through the pages for a few moments before finally stopping on a particular page that had been bookmarkedazzys eyes clearly skimmed through the page before closing it and turning her eyes up to midoriya, "okay so, to answer each of your questions, first up, your body is super tough and super strong, remember when that meat-sack tried to stab your side?" when midoriya tried to remember back to last night all she could recall was the taste of the mans essence, now blushing she shook her head. Azzy let out a giggle and continued, "well that knife broke against your skin, there's also your smell!" Suddenly feeling self conscious midoriya lifted her arm to smell at her pits which sent azzy into a peal of laughter, holding her gut as she wheezed, midoriya then stamped her foot down and accidentally sent it through the floorboards, only causing azzy to begin crying with laughter before regaining her composure while midoriya pulled the rug of her room over the whole, fretting more and more the longer she looked at it. Azzy wiped a tear from her eye as she said, "not, not that kind of smell, i guess you could call it pheromones, the more people smell it, the weaker they get at the knee's and more ready to bone, but on the other hand if any other monsters smell it they'll get stronger. oh and the more excited or angry you get, the more you make! simple right? other than that you're a bit faster than a regular human, but its more like having really good reflexes, that and your sense of smell is a whooooooooole lot better." midoriyas pen scribbled up a storm as she began muttering to herself once again, an old habit for when she was excited. despite still feeling somewhat sour at Azzys teasing her mind was positively buzzing with excitement at this news, her body was now everything she had ever hoped it could be, strong, fast, tough. the only downside she could see were her pheromones' they would make it difficult to fight in a team, quickly getting an idea however midoriya searched through her hero analysis notebooks once again before opening to her page on midnight, frantically scribbling notes and muttering something about a costumeazzy floated around her now bewildered by midoriyas muttering and scribbling as if she was a madwoman trying to write down a vision she had, azzy cautiously floated closer calling out, "champ?", only to be met with more muttering from midoriya as she began laying out ways to test and train her body, azzy inched closer and called louder, "champ!", once again only to once again be ignored as midoriya arrived on her fifth page of notes and her 3rd quickly scribbled drawing of her costume. Finally tired of being ignored azzy puffed up her cheeks and went right next to midoriyas ear, extending her tounge out to lick along the inside of ear. this certainly got midoriyas attention as she leapt up and yelped, turning to look at azzy while covering her ear in shock, azzy crossed her arms while drawing her tounge back into her mouth before asking, "So why this sudden interest in your body?"midoriya set aside her body analysis notebook and let out a sigh, "my....well hes not exactly a friend but, someone i know. he's run away from home and left this note about. how he's given up on his dream, i don't know why but, with this body-" midoriya looked down at her hands and squeezed them, feeling the muscle tense along her arms as she curled them up, pushing up a bicep, "-i can finally pursue mine, and if he's out there, maybe he'll see me, or hear about me and come home" her arms deflated as she sunk a bit, "i know its a long shot and i know its, kind of childish but, i don't know what else to do, whatever caused this i know he must be hurting and, and!" midoriya then stood up, looking azzy in the eye with a fire the little imp had not seen before, "and i know he needs a hero to save him!" with her proud declaration, azzy held up her palms towards her as if begging her to stop, "okay okay, jeez, point taken, alright fine i see its important to you, so ill lend you a hand, just don't shout like that again" with azzys offer of aid, midoriya lit up, she had never had someone to help her fulfill her dream before, "you'll help azzy?! that's great! thank you so, so much! im also sorry about shouting!" midoriya shouted, immediately going into an apologetic bow. it was now azzys turn to mutter as she said under her breath, "jeez, from lion to puppy dog in an instant, well at least you're funny" clearing her throat then, azzy floated to midoriyas window, "okay champ, I'm gonna go make some preparations, got it? you just stay here and act natural while azzy works her magic!" leaving out the window, azzy began searching and planning a regiment for hero in training-izuku midoriya. Elsewhere however, there was a problem Brewing___Rumi Usagiyama AKA the Rabbit Hero: Mirko had Arrived on the scene of a dingy park in desperate need of renovation, there was a small team of police who had cordoned off the area for investigation, one of which jogged up to greet her, a look of surprise on his face, "Whoa, so you really did come, i didn't think the pro heroes would get involved in a case like this, especially not one of the top ten!" he took off his cap to address her, Mirko could recognize a fan, or at least an "admirer" when she saw one but she had a mission, so she gave him a quick nod and crossed under the police line, "yeah well I've got an interest in this one I've already sent the paperwork in and ill be taking command on this investigation, gimme the details" the officer gave a full salute to her then and put his cap back on, "of course ma'am! if you'll follow me please, ill lead you to where the victim was found" as he lead her forward, Mirko's spine began to tingle as she entered the area, some vague sweet scene that tickled her nose, it was an old smell by the whiff of it, at least 8 hours. the feeling only got stronger as she was brought in front of an old tree, near the base of which was a clear slimey liquid spread around it and an old pair of pants and men's underwear, the latter was disturbingly rigid as the cop pointed near the Pants, "the victim was found by an early morning jogger, he was alive but in a state of extreme exhaustion and, well, naked from the waste down, he was transported to a hospital for care but has yet to wake up. People in the area reported hearing moaning late at night and a sound like glass shattering, but none went out to investigate" as Mirko listened she brought her gloved hand up to her nose, turning to the officer and asking, "hey, this is a real question, but do you smell that?" the officers confusedly tilted head was all the answer she required, she kept her hand over her nose as she said, "alright, so its my nose then, alright officer, thanks for the info, ill take it from here"the officer bowed and walked off to ensure the perimeter was secure, while Mirko investigated the crime scene, taking her hand off of her nose as she trailed around it, closing her eyes as she tracked the older smells first, "its a light scent from that direction, and then suddenly here-" she stood then on the worn path, "-it just bursts out" she then took a few steps forward then turned to the tree, "the smell gets stronger from there, and then concentrates hard around that tree" she made her way over to it and once again knelt next to it, having to cover her nose with her hand again as the scent here nearly got overpowering, she could feel behind her puffball of a tail fluttering and her nipples beginning to push out against her bra, this scent made her feel like she was going into a rut early. she took a step back and twitched as a glint of metal struck her eye, looking down at the offending piece, she squatted down to see a switchblade, or rather what had once been a switchblade, the handle itself was broken as if by great force, and the blade itself was shattered completely into tiny shards like glass. The pro hero marked it down as evidence and marched back to the edge of the crime scene, to both get away from the scent and to think. A scent that made her feel horny, a shattered switchblade, and the faint scent of mixed sexual juices. mirko began to feel as though she now understood what had happened here. going back to the epicenter of the crime scene she began to circle it, sniffing for a trail of that sweet scent and, sure enough, her nose picked it up, taunting her, tickling the rabbit part of her brain that wanted to grab the nearest stud and ride him for dear life-, she quickly cut off that line of thinking and once again found the officer who had greeted her, "I've got a lead I'm gonna follow, keep this place secure till then and tell the hospital to contact me immediately when the victim wakes up, got it? good" and without another word she was off, hopping from rooftop to rooftop as the scent trailed tugged her along---This had not been what izuku was Expecting She now stood in her All-Might All-year-round Exercise Tracksuit™ in front of....a literal actual mountain of garbage on a beach. Azzy floated in front of it with her arms proudly crossed. "This is where we're gonna train you!" izuku looked between her and a stack of broken TV's, "I don't follow" azzy then spun in the air to look at the piled upon piles of trash, "but its perfect! dontcha see? here you can get real rough and tumble with these piles and no ones gonna care! you cant break what's already broken after all!" it was then that a light clicked in midoriyas head as she put her fist in her palm, "ooooh i get it now! if we train here i can build up my strength an endurance hauling and disposing of trash! not just that but its a public service too! you know azzy i had my doubts but this is a really good idea, I'm really impressed!" azzy, upon hearing this, merely nodded her head sagely and tapped the side of it, "yes, all of that is true, and i am a geniusthis was a fat, bald faced lie but azzy would take that to her grave than pass up a chance to seem smartThe two ventured into the wandering maze of trash before coming to something of a clearing, in the center of which was a refrigerator someone had dumped out, azzy floated over to it and then sat atop it, "ooooooo, this looks nice and bulky, why don't you punch it as hard as you can to get a feel for those hammer arms of yours" with her suggestion, midoriya stepped up to the fridge, patting the front of it in confusion, "who throws out a while fridge?" azzy merely gave an equally clueless shrug, not knowing what a fridge was but floating away as she held her hand up, "alright, on the count of 3, throw that punch! 1-" as she began the countdown, izuku took a stance that she was all too familiar with, legs spread and punching arm back, just like All-might, azzy then brought up another finger, "2", izuku began to tense up her arms and legs again, looking at the fridge and trying to decide where to punch, "3!" the final number of the countdown hit and midoriya threw forward a wild punch aimed at the middle of the fridgeShe had been expecting it to move. What she didn't expect was how far or how hard where her fist connected the fridge folded in half as if it were a sandbag and launched back into the nearby piles of garbage, for a brief second midoriya saw light coming through the hole she had made in the pile, and the now collapsed one behind it where the fridge lay completely demolished like a soda can someone bent in half. This brief moment would come quite literally crashing down as the hole she had made was filled in by other bits of garbage and de-stabilized the whole pile. an avalanche of old lamps, desks and dressers came crashing down on midoriya as she stood there in shock. Expecting to have been crushed she was quite relived when she found not only was she still conscious but the falling debris hadn't actually hurt. Midoriya took a moment to get her bearing before she began crawling upwards, hands and feet pushing and pulling her up through the garbage until her hand broke the surface and she emerged, covered in grime but at least free, looking down at her now muck covered suit, she looked at the shocked azzy and remarked, "I think, we should start a bit smaller"--While midoriya had been burying herself in trash. Miruko now stood across the street from her house, she had followed the trail all the way from the park to here. The whole property stunk of it, she knew for sure she had found the place. It was a residential area and pretty nice from what she could tell. Having not wanted to draw too much attention she didn't stick around for long, just long enough to get the address before hopping along to the hospital where the victim was being treated, she had just gotten word that he had woken up and was willing to talk.arriving at the front doors she strode in without delay, only occasionally pausing to let a passing nurse or orderly come by before she continued. Getting the room number from the front desk nurse she approached the door and handed an address to the police officer guarding it, saying to him "get me info on who lives at this address. I'm going in to question the victim" before going in without another word, the guard took only a moment to internally remark on the quickness with which she had given the order before getting to work, calling into the station for information. Inside the room the victim sat hooked up to an IV drip, he looked haggard, like someone they'd pulled from a shipwreck at sea rather than the streets, as soon as his eyes turned to the door to see her walking through, he threw up his hands and yelled out in a panic, "A-AH, YOURE BACK!?" mirko was thrown for a loop with this statement, something she'd thought she was immune too by now in her career, but instead held up her hand and spoke in her best approximation of a calming voice, "whoa whoa whoa there big guy, take some deep breaths" with her insistence, the man lowered his arms to take another look at her, before slumping back into the bed, "oh thank god, you're not her" as he slumped back, mirko noticed something odd, that being that he had an absolutely raging erection under his robes. She had seen some shameless guys but that just felt absurd. The victim looked at her again, and followed her line of sight to his crotch before his head reclined, "Sorry, whatever she did to me its got my blood on fire, every time they send a nurse in here it gets like that", this statement threw Mirko's mind back to the scent at the park and her own crotch began to tingle a bit, crossing her arms she would say, "you know if this were any other case id say you were lying and just a perv, but i do believe you" she then moved next to the bed, looking down at him as he laid back with his eyes closed, "what can you tell me about what happened?"The victim brought his hand up to his forehead, "i cant, i cant quite remember, I know i walked up to her but, when i got close, my head, it started feeling so dam fuzzy. i tried to back away but she was on me" his legs arced up then as his whole body began to shiver, flattening his legs back down he continued, "and then, man it was like, i was drowning in her body, everywhere i touched i felt like  my fingers were sinking in, and she smelled so sweet too...its like my mind was getting sucked in by in" by now, judging by the unmistakable tenting and motion from his crotch, he was now masturbating, while he jerked off in front of the pro hero, he continued his description while mirko sat in equal parts confusion and revulsion as she saw the victim absolutely abusing himself with his hand,  "those long legs, i wanted to stay between em forever, that soft skin, it was like chocolate waiting to be licked, and her silvery white hair, i wanted to touch it too, it looked so soft, every part of her!" he then let out a great heaving groan as as he moved aside the blanket and the hospital gown to stroke himself undisrupted and soon. A thick jet of stringy cum flew from the tip of his cock and over himself, it was strong, both in the scent it gave off and the force of it. So hard would he cum that a splash of it would smear across Mirko's face causing her to leap out of her chair and shout out enough curse words to make a sailor blush, She immediately noticed the smell of it and how thick and pungent it was the ticklingly sweet feeling she got from the smell she had tracked once more came to mind.. An unconscious tounge swipe flicked out from her mouth to draw some in before she stood up and grabbed a nearby tissue, cleaning her face off as the victim fell into a slumber once again, his energy spentmirko left the room after pulling the mans hospital gown over his front again. In spite of him having giving her a pearly necklace mirko still felt his actions were being influenced, possibly by the same scent she smelt at the crime scene. She took a moment to wash her face in a nearby bathroom while she collected her thoughts. Someone with a quirk that allowed them to produce a lust-inducing pheromone. Not only that but that had some kind of amazingly tough body for the switchblade to shatter like that against her. Most bizarrely of all. She also seemed to bear a resemblance to mirko herself. She knew where the perp lived, She trusted her nose to steer her right and it lead her to that place. but now all there was to do was wait for a call back, something about this whole thing felt off and she needed more information before she could act, info that would come soon in the form of a phone call from the police station about her inquiry. ---The sun had risen high into the sky as midoriya charged across the sands, She had been practicing a move that high orcs apparently made great use of in Azzys world, A full front al charge. midoriya had been learning much from her new tiny friend, like the fact she could not subsist on "the essence of men" as well as food, but the more she fed the more tired it would make who she was feeding on. As well as the fact that Azzy, being an imp, could preform small spells and curses using this as a fuel. She had apparently been allowed to "Stock up" by her mistress before being assigned as Midoriyas assistantThis "super move" ,if you could even call it that in such a privative stage, had been coming along nicely. By using her now increased speed and stamina, she could charge forward to gain momentum and then deliver a blow to her opponent, simple on the surface but midoriya was finding she could change how she struck her target for different effect. By balling her fist up and striking she could deliver a lot of damage to a single point in a target, but by instead lowering her shoulder and striking with her full body she could send someone going a lot farther. She and azzy had gone through 5 fridges, a small truck and a bit of concrete rubble before midoriya found an old couch that still seemed to be in good condition. upon finding it, and realizing only after many hours of training was she getting tired. The duo then sat down for a break, midoriya lounging on the couch with her arms and legs spread apart. While azzy laid down across one of the arm-rests, soaking in the sun like a particularly lazy cat. as they sat and watched the waves crashing over the beach Azzy began to twirl her hair, eventually turning to midoriya to ask, "so I've been meaning to ask, this guy you wanna save as a hero, is he like, your boyfriend?" coming out with such a blunt question midoriya would push her fingers together in embarrassment, her feelings on Kachan were complex but, she would be lying if she didn't say there were sometimes she hoped that someday she could be with him, As naïve as that wish was. Still, she mustered her courage to speak on him, "its, complicated, I've admired him for so long but, sometimes i think that he barley even thinks of me. We were friends once but, he changed.." her voice trailed off then as azzy let out a low whistle, "oh dam, so this guys like, your childhood crush?" midoriya once again his behind her hands and groaned at azzys words, but she was utterly unable to deny them. Quickly thinking of anything to get her mind off of the subject, midoriya turned to azzy to say, "anyway! we need to think of a way to hide you, my mom will definitely freak out if she finds you in my room"  azzy actually seemed to consider this before floating up and winking at midoriya as she held a finger up, "oh don't worry champ, I've got a plan for this too, pretty good one too if i might add" midoriya leaned in curiously to hear about what this stroke of brilliance could be---Unbeknownst to both Monstergirls on the couch, they were being watched, from a nearby rooftop mirko spied them through a pair of field binoculars she kept on her as part of her costume, looking between the duo and then down to midoriyas medical sheet. It was definitely her, she matched the physical description of when she was released, Though mirko could barley believe it even while seeing the photos that the tall muscular girl she was seeing through her binoculars was once a scrawny pale kid with frumpy hair and bully-me-please eyes, not just that but she had a nearly flawless record of good behavior in school with the only known incident being a few times when she'd tried to stand up for others, usually getting her ass handed to her as a result. Mirko squatted down on the rooftop and considered everything she had learned about midoriya, She was a kid whos quirk activated when she was put into a life or death situation and it'd altered her body immensely, she had animal like features in her fur and tail, She seemed to emit some kind of sweet scent that could make someone smelling it go crazy with lust.Putting it all together, she felt she now had a picture of what had happened now. Midoriya, with her quirk now awakened, was unfamiliar with and unable to control the new impulses her body gave out. Trying to satiate it she left her home and walked far away to a place she hoped she could fulfill those desires without anyone from her own neighborhood catching her. Being an amateur at everything criminal based on her spotless record, she didn't think to cover her tracks or was otherwise too blissed out to care. As it stood, if she was caught she could go to prison for sexual assault. Anyone with that on their record was pretty much screwed at finding legitimate work. A part of her did consider simply going to the police then and there, midoriya HAD committed a crime after all. However mirko thought of the struggles she'd faced with her own quirk, though not many in the public knew this she would go into periods of heat, it was a surprisingly common trait among heroes with animal-like mutations, and she knew how dam crazy it could make her feel. Hell once she had blown through 3 motors in a vibrator during a particularly bad heatIf midoriya went to jail, it would only ruin her and that quirk of hers could lead to a lot of unsavory things happening to her. Making a Decision then and there, The rabbit hero hopped down from the building and began making her way towards the beach, having come to a decision.---Midoriya Smelt something approaching that made her hair stand on end, she wasn't sure what it was but she felt it in her bones. Someone dangerous was approaching, she immediately bolted to her feet looking left and right, before then looking behind her to see a woman land atop one of the piles of garbage like a meteor, a bunny shaped meteor at that at standing above her was none other than the current 6th ranked hero herself, Mirko. While midoriyas mouth opened to gasp in amazement, Azzy went to hide under the cushions. Fruitlessly as mirko called down in a harsh tone, "hey! i see you don't there, don't try to hide you little sneak!", her gaze then drifted over to midoriya whos mouth slowly began to close as she felt a bad premonition coming on, "and you kid, where do you get off assaulting men in the middle of the night huh?" with those words midoriyas blood ran immediately cold as she began to stammer out a half answer, but could only eek out the first few words of what would be a sentence while the cold eyes of the number 6 hero began to drill into her, speaking up then, "kid, you're coming in with me, you're gonna answer for your crime, and so is the little sneak hiding under those cushions!" these words however shook midoriya from her stupor, Azzy was...well Azzy, but ultimately midoriya was the one who had pounced on that man, "wait! please you've got it all wrong! this girl, she's got nothing to do with this!" azzy scooted herself out from under the cushion and harshly whispered, "hey champ what are ya doing incriminating yourself like that" however, midoriya simply stepped forward and held her wrists together, hanging her head, "just, please if you're going to arrest someone let it be me and just me okay?"for a long time the rabbit hero squatted on top of the pile of trash, before grinning and sliding down, slapping midoriyas hands apart, "heh, not bad kid" ,her sudden joviality took izuku off guard, as the rabbit hero walked around her, taking in the view of her body, but stepping back as she once again felt that sweet scent coming off of her, "taking responsibility, and the fall, your bodies made for fighting too by the looks of it, but we're gonna have to do something bout that smell of yours" midoriya would then turn around to face the rabbit hero, now utterly confused, "i, i don't understand, you're, not arresting me?" this brought a bigger grin to the rabbit hero, "nope! its worse kid, im gonna be TRAINING YOU! you've got some real guts kid, and it'd be a dam shame to waste them sending you to Tartarus! as for that little incident, i aint condoning it, but i do get it" her grin only spread wider into a look more befitting of a villain as she leaned forward, "don't think I'm gonna go easy on you just cause i feel for you, you're dangerous if we don't get you under control, so I'm gonna pound some discipline into you" midoriya felt a shiver run down her spine as the rabbit hero stood in front of her, as if she were in the sights of a hunter---Bakugou Woke up with a start, he'd had the same dream again, stupid deku running in and getting her ass handed too her, all with that dam grin and tears running down her stupid face. He quickly dashed it from his mind and began his morning exercises around his campground. He had packed up some clothes, and a camping kit his family used to use in the summer months go out under the stars. He had been getting a lot of use out of them as he took up residence in the nearby mountains.After going about his daily exercises, he wrapped a scarf tightly around his face and put on the skiing goggles he had taken as well, for his mission today he needed the most protection he could get. He set out into the woods with a speed and quiet focus that one wouldn't expect from someone usually so loud and brash. Eventually upon reaching a hill he had spied his target, a small innocuous cabin parked next to a river, below were 3 men in skull masks and hoods, they sat around an outdoor table rigging and preparing explosives.They were members of villain group called the "creature rejection clan" and bakugou had learned of their existence as he began to dip his toes into the underwork, Bigots with a hatred of mutation-class quirks, wishing to see them eradicated. The encounter he'd had with the slime villain had taught bakugou something, even with heroes around every corner, there always seemed to be some group or person who slipped through the cracks. People who met in secret out away from society like this, Who did their harm and then were stopped. Maybe the slime Villain had managed to evade capture simply by sticking away from larger cities? how many heroes operated in the countryside, and for that matter how many would be strong enough to stop a powerful villain like that? these were the words that had bounced inside of Bakugous skull ever since he'd seen deku swatted into a building and crushed like a fly, taken away from the rubble barley breathing and covered in her own blood, All because a villain had managed to slip through the cracks and come into society, ready to do harm.He readied himself for the fight, tensing his legs under him and throwing his arms behind him, igniting his palms in explosive forces of fire as he rocketed towards the 3 villains, shouting out, "HEY SHITHEADS, YOU WANNA MAKE SOME EXPLOSIVES WHY DONT YOU TRY MINE?!" 
  
    Chapter Text
    Midoriya and azzy remained in awe and confusion to the sight of mirko standing above them, with her declarations of mentorship azzy floated up from under her hiding place of a couch cushion and wagged it unapprovingly in the pro's face, "now listen up here! I'm the one training her so where do you get off making statements like that huh?!" mirko didn't lean away from the furious little imp but instead put her hands on her hips and grinned back, "cause I've been watching what this "training" is, just throwing around junk and shoving muscle around? that's not gonna do dick when you're tryin ta be a pro!" she jabbed her thumb into her chest then, "I know what she's gonna need to make it as a pro, and that's the only way I'm letting you too little deviants walk free, when I know you've got some discipline in ya!" midoriya would flinch again at being called deviant, but she felt her heart hammering in her chest in excitement once again, not only would she have a chance to become a pro, but she's also get to learn from one of the top heroes! in her excitement she stepped forward and said, "I'm in! I cant promise ill be a good student but please take care of me!" she bowed her head then, causing mirko to smile and shout, "good attitude kid!" while azzy crossed her arms disapprovingly.The rabbit hero made a short series of hops down the pile to stand in front of midoriya, who had since stood up once again, it was only once standing in front of midoriya that mirko got a sense for her size, saying aloud, "Dam you're tall, not that used to lookin up at someone" she would then bring up her hand to her nose, pinching it as she smelt the ever so faint sweet aroma that seemed to emanate from around her, "those pheromones' of yours might be a bit tricky to work around but I've got some ideas, regardless kid, you're pretty dam strong, there's no doubt about that, but do you know how to fight?" somewhat sheepishly, midoriya would shake her head, pushing her fingers together in embarrassment, mirko would remove her hand from her nose and, being far enough away to not be affected by the aroma, would resume talking, "then that's what we're working on first, i wanna see you here, tomorrow at the crack of dawn! you're late even a minute and I'm making your day hell you got that!" mirko shouted with all of the authority her voice could muster, which was a lot, enough to shock midoriya into a salute, "y-yes ma'am!"with the affirmation of her pupil, mirko then turned around, "good! now go home and get some rest for tomorrow, I've gotta go straighten things out and make sure the cops don't come down on your ass like a thunder-bolt" she would then swiftly turn around and point at midoriya, "and stay inside this time, no going out at night for any of that fooling around, got it!? its gonna be hard enough sweeping that first little incident of yours, i don't need you dropping another steaming pile of mess in my lap while I'm trying to do it!" with that, the rabbit hero rocketed off in a series of powerful jumps, leaving the star-struck midoriya and the annoyed azzy alone on the beach---It wasn't until that night when watching the news with her mother that midoriya would see mirko again, azzy had once again floated off somewhere when midoriya went back home as to not arouse suspicion leaving the hero in training to have another typical night with their mother. It was when it came time to wash dishes and the elder midoriya flicked on the small kitchen TV they had to watch the news while working that midoriya whirled around upon hearing her new mentors voice come on, The news was showing mirko hopping around town from cellphone camera footage before switching to live footage of her at a press conference, "yeah its true, i came down here cause a little incident caught my attention, but in the end i couldn't find who was responsible, so I'm going to be staying down here for a few months, make sure this cities safer when i leave, its simple as that!" abruptly ending the press meeting with the bold declaration, Inko Midoriya spoke up ,"my, one of the top heroes couldn't solve a case? makes you wonder how bad things must be" her gaze worriedly drifted over to midoriya then who knew her mother must've been worrying about a repeat of the near-tragedy the family had experienced just a short while ago. ---It was the next day and midoriya had quietly slipped out of her home before the crack of dawn, leaving a note on her door informing her mother that she had gone off to train for the upcoming hero course entrance exam, standing on the dis-used beach midoriya stood yawning and dressed in a, now 2 sizes too small, track suit, and awaiting her new mentor nervously, only to then hear her from behind, "yo!" the young hero-in-training whirled around in shock to see the rabbit hero standing behind her nonchalantly wearing a bizarre ensemble of clothes, firstly she was wearing a pair of thick aviator shades, a Wide brimmed white panama hat atop her head and hero costume which was concealed under a thick trench coat, "we're definitely gonna have to work on is your awareness, if you get snuck up on like that out on patrol you're as good as dead!" she would then lift her shades to show her shining red eyes, "its me mirko by the way, had to come in disguise!" midoriya balked upon hearing that, wanting to ask how dressing like a private detective was a disguise but was quickly cut off as the rabbit hero loudly slurped down the last of her coffee cup before tossing it over her shoulder and into the lid of a discard trash can laying at an odd enough angle that let the errant piece of litter land soundly inside of it, "i saw that you're already got some impressive strength in those muscles, so instead we're going to train up the skills you need to be a hero" without a moment of hesitation, mirko then brought up her fists, throwing her shades and hat to the side as she said, "and the first of those is gonna be learning how to use those muscles! come on try and hit me!"midoriya stared at the rabbit hero in surprise, and then began to shy away as she looked down rubbing the back of her neck, "I'm, not sure i should do that, the other day i punched a fridge in ha-" midoriyas apology was cut short by the foot of the rabbit hero spearing into her gut with an impact like a gunshot, midoriya doubled over immediately holding her arms across her stomach as she did so, while above her stood the rabbit hero, with her fists on her hips once again, shaking her head, "no good kid, no good, if you think I'm too weak to handle a scrub like you, then we're never gonna get anywhere in training!" she would squat down then as midoriya began to regain some of her breath, pushing herself up look at the hazy face of the rabbit hero who continued, "have some faith in me why doncha?" she stood up again and brought her fists up, 'now stand up, and try to hit me!"---The next few days of midoriyas life were an extremely mixed bag, she returned to school at last. Much to her surprise many of her classmates welcomes her back warmly, some even apologizing for how they had treated her previously, apparently a video of midoriya running in to try and save Kachan had circulated around the school and made her something of a local hero around school, her new appearance certainly helped matters judging by the blushing looks some of the boys, and even girls, of the school shot her way on occasion. Kachan being missing was also a widely discussed topic that midoriya would jump in on to try and gain any information on as to where he could be, but to no avail. Her mornings however were spent with The rabbit hero mirko, mostly getting the bacon pounded out of her with Mirko's hooks, jabs, kicks knees elbows grapples, throws and everything in between being thrown midoriyas way. She would go to school with bruises and lumps hidden under her uniform though she seemed to be able to heal from these rather quickly, by that evening the bruises and lumps having faded away into dull pains. It had been nearly a week since training began and midoriya was beginning to feel odd again, when she sat down to eat dinner that night she found herself still hungry, her eyes widening as she focused on the feeling and confirmed, indeed, it was the same hunger that seized her a week ago.Upon realizing what it was midoriya had darted up to her room to look if azzy had dropped by, she had been coming and going as she pleased for the last few days, doing more "Scouting" as she called it, though suspiciously she kept coming back with more and more memorabilia each time. Upon searching her dresser drawers for azzy as she had taken to hiding in whenever she was there, midoriya found nothing but did find her phone, recalling the mirko had given her number, midoriya quickly scrolled through her contacts list to dial up the rabbit hero, the whole reason she had been taken under Mirko's wing was to learn control over these impulses so surely she had a solution. As the phone dialed away midoriya paced in her room anxiously, mirko eventually picking up the call, "yo midoriya, what's up?" feeling relief at her voice midoriya almost collapsed as she said, "u-um, mirko, do you remember how you said you wanted to train me how to deal with my, urges-" midoriya said that word quietly, as if it were a secret, "-i, kind of need that lesson now, like, right now" mirko on the other end let out a low whistle as she heard this, "dam, again? so soon? alright kid I'm going to give you an address, get there quietly and don't tell anyone else it, okay? ill be waiting there" with the instructions, and address, in mind, midoriya set out on what she explained to her mother as a late night jog before jetting out the door---Arriving at the location midoriya was surprised to see it was a rather nice looking home gated off from the street, the gate was closed but when midoriya reached out to pull on the handle, it slid out with an unusually loud crack, wincing for a moment but by now absolutely feeling the effects of her "hunger" she stepped through the gate and closed it behind her, what she didnt see was how the bar she had pulled had been locked from the inside, a lock that had broken clean off by thenher fist hadn't even touched the door when it was opened by the rabbit hero herself, and out of uniform to boot, she seemed to only be wearing a massively oversized sweater that hid the curves of her body under quilted fabric, though her long legs sticking out of said clothes still showed her appeal as she stepped to the side, silently beckoning her new protegee inside as the rabbit hero quickly poked her head outside to look left and right, seeing no spies stalkers or paparazzi she quickly closed the door and locked itinside the house was quite fancy, a large open living room, a connected kitchen from which midoriya smelt carrots and eggs, and a colossal TV hanging on one wall, "how did you-" she would be cut off by the rabbit hero, who's ear twitched, "being in the top ten heroes pays off, I've ranted this place out for the next 6 months for your training, its nice, its spacious, and above all else, no one knows this is where I'm resting my head, if we wanna get those urges under control, then its going to have to stay that way, got it?" the hero-in training swiftly nodded her head, with it, mirko pointed down the hall, "3rd door on the left is the master bedroom, get comfortable, ill be in there in a second"Following these instructions, midoriya found herself in a bedroom that was the size of her living room, with a bed so large she could lay across it and stretch her arms up, and yet still have room, something she did immediately as her body had outgrown her bed at home, stretching out onto the fur-like cover of the bed, getting comfortable as she was advised, looking around midoriya could see the room was sparsely decorated, and the closet was empty save for a duffle bag that looked large enough to contain a week or so's worth of clothes, and hanging in the closet were a few copies of Mirko's hero uniform, hanging and each neatly pressedwhile midoriya observed, mirko stepped into the room, midoriya sitting up to look at her, "thank you again for helping me, i didn't know who else to turn to-" her voice stopped short, as did most of her brain functions as, stood in front of her was mirko, completely nude, the thick sweater she had been wearing had dropped to the floor, she then moved over to the bed, grinning, "that look on your face is pretty adorable kid, but you weren't making your attraction subtle ya know, staring at how my chest and ass moved" while she spoke, she guided the dumbfounded midoriyas hands towards the bedposts, where each was locked into place with a set of novelty pink fuzzy handcuffs, it was only when both hands were bound did midoriya notice, looking between them and the rabbit hero, who moved to straddle her protegees hips, as she did so, midoriya asked, "u-um, mirko, what are these handcuffs for?" to this question, mirko shook her head, "just call me rumi kid, given what's gonna happen, doesn't make much sense to call me by my hero name, unless you're into that. those handcuffs for for my safety believe it or not. your pheromones' are pretty powerful, i got a whiff of em when you walked in and, well-" pushing herself up on her knees and bringing her hands down along her hips, midoriya could now see a thin trail of fluid ran down her thigh, "if i need to pull back, i cant have you getting into the heat of the moment and pulling me back in alright? so just lay back and let me show you a good time, we'll get you through this little heat flash" midoriya could only nod as her face reddened, straddling her now was a pro hero, one who seemed to be turned on by her, and one midoriya had to admit, was also doing things for her ,it may have been the hunger in her loins but she wanted mirko to caress her, and for herself to be able to caress mirko, her arms and legs that had been delivering powerful blows to her all weak now looked so firm and invitingmirko began by sliding her hands under midoriyas shirt and pushing them up to the simple plain pink bra the hero-in-training wore, pulling it down to reveal light pink nipples that were perked up and begging for attention, which they promptly got from the gently kneading hands of mirko, pressing them from the sides and gropping along the underside before them moving over to the top of her breasts, where Mirko's hands then began to press into and push her nipples back in, causing the young midoriya to squirm under the pressure, mirko spoke teasingly as she rubbed one nipple between her thumb and forefinger, "don't get so antsy, we're just beginning, just breathe in and out and focus on what you're feeling now" as she spoke, she lowered more and more of her body onto midoriyas, who felt every curve of her legs against her own and her chest pressing into midoriyas stomach, but soon a new sensation would take over the mind of the young hero as mirko placed her mouth over her nipple, taking it into her caressing mouth where her tounge met the tip and began to gently move it around, like a thumb meeting a joystick it was steered by the tip causing midoriya to let out a moan and rub her legs together in neednot one to ignore the needs of the hero-in-training rumi reached her nod free hand down to midoriyas pants, pulling them down low enough for her toes to reach up and then pull it down to midoriyas ankles, leaving her groin open to the air, and to exploration as rumi then brought her hand back up to rest over midoriyas pussy, feeling the heat coming off of it even from a few inches away, rumi moved her mouth away from midoriyas nipple to speak, drawing her attention down, showing her hand hovering over midoriyas pussy, fingers dangling enticingly out of reach, "I'm going to start putting these in you now, ready?" with an eager nod from her protegee, rumi wasted little time, only pausing to rub against the entrance her fingers had hovered over to become slick with midoriyas juices, becoming wet and lubricated before then pushing an exploring finger inside of her, midoriyas chest arched up as her arms strained against the handcuffs, only for rumi to pull her finger out, much to midoriyas shock as she looked down and began to make a whining noise, rumi however, stayed resolute as she pointed to the handcuffs keeping midoriya stationary, "relax your arms, and your body, keep getting tense like that, and im just going to keep pushing it in and then taking it out, until you learn to relax and control yourself in sex, you're not Cumming" with her finger once again extended, rumi once again entered midoriya, only for her back to arch once again, unable to help herselfThis continued on in a maddening cycle for hours, a finger going in, tension, and a finger going out, midoriya simply couldn't help herself until, eventually, she had been edged too far, as she once again felt the probing finger reach inside of her, her now starved insides puckered and began to shake as she let out a stuttering moan, her knees knocking together as her whole body began to convulse, she had built and built and built with no release until her body simply couldn't take any more and took matters into her own hands, pulling rumis finger in to touch deeper parts of her before then releasing in a stream of feminine juice to release from midoriya like a dam had been broken, she laid there for several minutes, simply trying to catch her breath from her explosive finish, while rumi sat away from here, almost overwhelmed by the sheer force of the smell that now filled the room with scents of sweet embraces, muttering to herself, "we've got a long way to go..."---The next few months of midoriyas life could best be described as hellish and heavenly in equal measures, in the mornings she would be taught combat skills and training by mirko, learning to move her body more efficiently, quicker, faster, stronger. Her punches became refined and targeted, her charges were faster and her grapples were absolutely killer, at one point even being able to pin the rabbit hero into submission. Her nights meanwhile were filled either with reports from azzy about her traveling around japan to understand it, or reporting that she had moved into the bakugou household in the guise of a transfer student needing a home, midoriya didn't ask how she had managed to secure the legal papers, assuming it involved no small amount of crime and/or seduction on the imps part. The other part of her nights were her weekly "training sessions" with rumi, she had been learning more and more restraint over time, but the journey hadn't been easy, In the first month she had all but always been tied down in some way, sometimes on her back, sometimes on her chest, sometimes made to kneel while rumi went at her from behind, by the second month however, midoriya had gained enough self control to not be untied during these sessions, its here where rumi showed that her mouth could not only spew viscous insults, commands and helpful instructions, but made midoriyas mind boggle, she had also been on the giving end by now as rumi instructed her on the ways to please partner, using both split cantaloupes (which made for a good healthy snack afterward) and bananas to demonstrate to techniques used for women and men, by the third month rumi had begun to use strap-on's to prepare midoriya for how to treat the real thing, these had been her favorite lessons as she was taught various positions to take when on or off the bed, and what the benefits of each were. by the 4th month, now she was the one wearing the strap-on, at Mirko's insistence as she insisted it was a valuable tool to be used when appropriate. Whereas before midoriya had been all but glued to the bottom of rumi the last few months, now was her turn to take the lead, here was where the size different between the rabbit hero and midoriya became most apparent, as she pumped and pushed herself into rumi, she began to take note of how easily she could be lifted up with just one arm, or her legs held up above her head, how her hand could hold rumi's jaw and so easily slide a finger or two into her mouth to play with. She began to enjoy this feeling greatly. As the 5th month came back rumi began to show midoriya that pleasure couldn't come just from expert fingering, a deep passionate kiss to certain areas of the body, or a hot and sweaty embrace of rubbing and humping, but from her rear as well, Rumi began to train midoriya in all the ways in which she could take advantage of natures backdoor, and how to do it properly, its around this time that midoriya began too come to rumi's rented house now every night rather than every other night. By the 6th month  midoriya practically lived there in the evening, Excused to her mother as a special training program (with some assistance from rumi, who told midoriyas mother of how she had been tutoring and mentoring the younger midoriya for some months, causing the elder midoriya to cry tears of such joy at how many prospects her baby girl it caused minor water damage) the facade of lessons were gone now and replaced with the two doing whatever they pleased however they pleased, some nights they returned to handcuffs and restraints, while other times they simply pleasured each other for hours on end and into the night. It was the morning of the UA entrance exam that rumi awoke alone, a rarity in these last few weeks. Finding a note that said her pupil (and in all honesty, her lover by this point) had gone down to the beach to finish somethingthrowing on some inconspicuous civilian clothes and heading down in curiosity, she found midoriya standing on a completely clear beach, 6 months ago stacks upon stacks upon stacks of trash had piled up here for years, but now it looked clean as it had been in years prior, midoriya stood on the beach atop the last pile, now only a miniscule hill of debris, picking up peices of scrap and folding them, crushing them into balls as small as a basketball before tossing them into a near little pile beside her, when she had finished the last bits of trash on the beach had been crunched down to a pile smaller than herself, looking at her pile with crossed arms and look of pride. Seeing her pupil standing so tall, rumi could feel herself tearing up, surprising herself as she quickly wiped the tears away, today was the US entrance exam, and also her time to return home, she wasn't going to let the last sight her pupil saw be her mentor balling her eyes out, even if it was from pride! The rabbit hero stepped forward and said, "so you cleaned out the beach huh?" upon hearing her voice, midoriya turned around and grinned with genuine excitement, "it took a while but, i really did it, it didn't feel right to leave it unfinished, what i wanted to do here i mean" she looked down at her arm then, clenching her fists and pumping her bicep, patting it in pride, before then stopping and rubbing the back of her head, "uh, sorry, i should be thanking you too" rumi let out a bold laugh then, walking forward and patting her protegee on the shoulder, "ah its fine, you've really grown kid, take some pride in it, you cleaned up this nasty old beach, and now you don't fight like an asthmatic squid either!" midoriya herself chuckled at that, looking out over the waves as the sun rose. knowing what day it was she didn't want to say good bye to her teacher ,not only because of what they had been getting up to at night, but her boldness and loudness had helped midoriya through some of the growing pains of getting used to her new body.Rumi was the first to bring it up, "im not gonna be around there by tomorrow, but i will be able to hear if you pass or failed, favor from some of the staff" she then whipped out her phone to check the time, "speaking of, youd better get going if you wanna make the test" showing her student the time, rumi hoped to avoid an awkward goodbye, but what happened next was a shock to her as midoriya leaned forward and grabbed her cheeks with both hands, pulling her up and into a passionately deep kiss. They'd shared many like it in private, but out in the open like this it might as well have been a gunshot going off for all the trouble it could bring, rumi wanted to pull away but the sweet scent shed come to know so well kept her enraptured until midoriya set her down, at which point she stepped back with a red face, speaking harshly, "what the shit?! you know that could get us both in trouble if we're seen!" midoriya would turn away then, saying, "well, i just, wanted to make you blush for once, is all", her wish was more than granted as, upon hearing a line like that, mirko did flush as brightly as she had once made her pupil do. with that ,midoriya took off sprinting down the beach towards the entrance exam. The truth behind that moment would be written across midoriyas face which was blazing red at the boldness of both her last move and parting words to her mentor, still unable to believe she had said such embarrassingly heartfelt things, much less that it had worked in making the ever grinning and ever confident mirko be the one to blush. As she ran from her own embarrassment, azzy watch from nearby, grinning as she said to herself, "that girl has grown pretty quick, and snagged someone's heart too."---Midoriya had arrived to The school of her dreams UA, dressed in her school uniform, she stood marveling at the grand structure of steel and glass as other prospective heroes moved in chatting and shuffling around her, while midoriya stood stock still staring at the sacred arches she had dreamed of walking through, "i cant believe it, I'm actually here" staring up at the arches as she moved through them, she looked down at her hand, while her other one carried a duffle bag filled with notes to go over before the written exam, and a jump suit her size to wear during the practical exam, midoriya began giving herself an internal pep-talk, "okay midoriya, you can do this, you've trained for 6 months! you've been training nonstop! taken hundreds of blows from one of the top heroes in the country! crushed fridges into balls with your bare hands! you can win! YOU FEEL GREAT, YOU, CAN,DO ,THIS, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH" her strategy worked at little too well as she began to vibrate as she had broken out into an incredibly brisk power walk, causing most other applicants to quietly step away from her or otherwise get out of the way, all but one as midoriya felt the tip of her shoe connect with something solid, something that yelped as it was launched forward.Shaken from her stupor she cast her gaze forward to see a small boy, not small as in young but small as in absolutely diminutive, he wasn't even 4 feet tall and looked like he had, grapes(?) for hair, midoriya bent down to inspect him further, when she noticed the imprint of her boot in the young mans ass, letting out a cry of shock as she shouted out apologies, bending down to picked the dazed young man, dusting him off as she apologized faster than a speeding locomotive, setting him on his feet and asking, "are you okay?! im so sorry!" and clapping her hands together in apologysaid young man, once shaken from his daze of having what felt like a freight train barrel into him from behind, he gazed up to see the exotic looking midoriya bowing to him in apology, his eyes didn't know where to look first, to her majestic legs that seemed to stretch to the heavens? to her sharp yet delicate features that curled in remorse? or to her massive honking chest?! he was spoiled for too many fantastic choices, so much so he didn't notice she was apologizing for a few good seconds, putting a hand on the back of his head to say, "oh uh, its cool, no biggie" while his eyes now settled on her chest ,only able to imagine the softness and secrets they held, not entirely listeningupon hearing the small boys acceptance, she would look up again and say, "a-are you sure? i did bump into you like that!" his eyes however continued gazing up and his hand waved, "oh, really its cool" she was about to insist that she repay him somehow when she heard the call for all applicants to head immediately to the exams orientation hall, looking up towards it and saying, "oh crap! the exam!" not thinking of the young boy in front of her, she stepped over his diminutive size and began running in earnest towards the exam hall, shouting back, "im sorry again!" The young man, mineta, never considered himself lucky, his height, attitude, appearance, personality, perversion, general lack of confidence or social skills. had often dreamed of meeting a girl, taking her on dates, feeling up her chest, normal things any boy thinks about, and now he had just gotten an eyeful of a beautiful girl apologizing to him and on top of that, he had seen up her skirt, and he didn't even try too! from deep within him roared  out a declaration, "IM GONNA PASS THIS EXAM, THE GIRLS HERE RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUULE!" filled with determination like a man reborn he sprinted into the orientation hall as if possessed by the spirit of victory itself---The inside of the orientation hall was darkened and back with potential students, those sitting next to midoriya having to lean away from her massive bulk which caused no shortage of apologies and fiddling on the hero hopefuls part, but her embarrassment changed to excitement as she saw none other than the voice hero present mic take the stage, he announced to a silent crowd the rules of the exam, fishing out responses and cheers only to be met by silence from the students who were either too focused on the test ahead of them, or generally unimpressed by his antics. Suddenly a hand shot into the air pointing out a flaw in the presenters presentation, "PARDON ME! but i could not help but notice there is a gap of information! look here!" he held up the exam card pointing to it with mechanical precision, in fact the way he moved his whole body was somewhat robotic, his arms moved and swung around at right angles a lot more than a normal person would, "you have told us that there are robots ranging from 1 point to 3 points to be wary of and destroy! but,BUT! there is also a 4th robot listed which shows to have a no point value! what is the meaning of this, and FURTHERMORE!" he whipped around to point his whole hand at midoriya, who was shocked from her mutterings on strategies to take down each robot, "you girl! with the unkempt and dare i guess, DYED hair! you have been muttering this entire time and take up far too much room in your own seat! please either request your own seating so those around you may be comfortable or leave!" midoriya looked back, shocked at first before rallying and shooting back with the best comeback she could muster, "my hair isn't dyed! its just my quirk!" to which the robotic boy would push up his glasses and announce with as much enthusiasm as he had delivered the initial accusation with, "I SEE! i apologize profusely for my assumption!" present mic then held up his hand and made calming gestures towards the two before they could begin bickering, "yeah! save that noise for the practical exam and listen up while i explain! that 4th robot is the biggest and the maddest but its worth squat in points! so its the one you've gotta avoid ya see!?" the robotic student then immediately sat down with the precision he apparently packed into all of his movements, "yes i do! thank you for your explanation!" while he sat down ,midoriya still huffed at the words he had hurled her way, but thoughts of this 0 point robot began to take up more of her mind, she began to wonder about its size and strength, and if it could really be so strong. Though to be more specific, she wondered how strong it was when compared to herself?After the orientation the students were put into groups and ushered outside to one of many training facilities on the UA grounds, around midoriya there were many other prospective students inducing the robotic boy from the orientation hall, midoriya began to ponder if she should approach him or not but this train of thought was interrupted by the voice of present mic shouting down to them from a speaker, "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALright! are you guys ready for the practical exam?!" some of the students let out an accenting cheer, ready to get going, midoriya included. with this the doors to the training area suddenly opened ad present mic said, "WELL THEN GO!" everyone was thrown for a moment, standing still as they were shocked to be given such an immediate go-ahead, only for present mic to say, "what were you expecting a countdown?! there's no such thing in the field! so get going already!" this was the nessacary shock to get the prospective students into high gear, each charging ahead into the training grounds, but none more-so than midoriya and the robotic boy who were practically neck-a-neck as they charged aheadthe two leading students, midoriya and ida, shared a look before both quietly came to an understanding and ran in opposite directions when they came to the first intersection in the training areas fake city streets, midoriya went left and began searching around for the bots that had been described, only for one to come shooting out of an alleyway in front of her, it was a 1 point robot from what she could see and, wasting no time, increased the pace of her charge dramatically, barreling into the bot with an absolutely dynamite haymaker, clipping the bot in half before moving onfrom a remote viewing location the various teachers of UA watched the progress of their various prospects, among their number was the principal of the school, nezu, and next to him was none other than the rabbit hero mirko, nezu mused as he watched midoriya pick up a 3 point robot and hurl it into 2 1-point robots, taking all 3 out as they collided, "you know, with her physical capabilities and your training, she could've simply gotten in on recommendation alone", this made mirko grin and let out a chuckle, "what, and let them get in on the easy way? that kid doesn't need anything like that" she would smirk as she pointed to the screen to see midoriya suplex a 2 point robot as it was about to knock out another student, "she's got everything she needs to walk on her own now"the test proceeded like that for a while, every robot midoriya came across was dispatched quickly, even managing to help a few other students along the way, she was beginning to feel quite confident in her chances when the ground began to shake, looking up and around was when midoriya saw i approaching from the distance, a colossal robot that could almost peer over the largest buildings in the fake city. its colossal green frame turned towards where midoriya was, as it walked she could see dozens of other prospective students running away, one calling out, "its the 0 pointer! just avoid it!" midoirya herself was about to turn and run, but looking back at the 0 pointer she felt neither dread nor fear, instead an odd excitement was building up in her chest, she had been all but manhandling the various other point robots and now here was one that dwarfed them all, rather than run away, she began to run towards it before she knew what her body was doingBack in the observation hall, the various teachers muttered amongst themselves, it wasn't unusual to get a student or 2 who would try to face down the 0 pointer, but this was the first time theyd seen someone charging at it with a grin on their face. as midoriya ran at the 0 pointer robot, its massive head turned down to look at her as it raised its massive hand before bringing it to slam down on midoriya, seeing the gap in its fingers she lept up, pulling herself up and between its fingers as they slammed into the concrete where midoriya had just been standing, she began running up along its arm as it brought its other hands to the top of said arm before sweeping it down like one would do when trying to swat a bug off of them, but the charging midoriya reeled her hand and threw it forward, then her other one, repeating this as her fists cracked and crashed against the fist, eventually making her own path through the hand, which the upper part of now crashed into the street below, severed from the arm by the relentless fists of midoriyaback in the observation hall, by now the teachers had each been stunned into silence, nezu began to scratch his cheek as he saw the hand crashing down, "power loader isnt going to be happy about someone damaging the 0 pointer" mirko began to look to the side as she felt there was more incomingas midoriya lept up from the 0 pointers shoulder, she lept forward with all of her might, bringing her right hand forward and hooking it into the side of the 0 pointers head, actually knocking it to the side as her fists cratered into the metal ,denting it and reshaping its face, her momentum carrying her to its other shoulder, where she then skid to a stop before she could fall off, and then turned around and did yet another running jump at its head, socking it from the other side as well, now the robot began to tip backwards dangerously close to falling, as its body angled down now, midoriyas feet landed on its chest, where she began to slide down, thinking fast, she kicked off her shoes to let her bare feet press against the metal and find purchase, at which point she began to run up the robots body, with some difficulty at first, but soon she was charging up with all the speed of before, the 0 pointer had just enough time to look down and identify the charging midoriya before one last centeral blow to the center of its face knocked its blocky head clean offthose in the observation hall sat in silence for a few moments while mirko couldn't help but grin, "told ya she had all that she needed" nezu quietly whatched midoriya on screen while the other teachers began buzzing about her performance, mirko turned to leave then as nezu looked towards her, "dont want to stick to the end of the test?" to which the rabbit hero would shake her head, "ive seen everything i needed too, the kids a shoo-in now. ive already said my goodbyes to her, so im leaving her in your hands nezu, take good care of her alright?" the principle gave a slight smile as he turned back to the screen, "but of course, i think i know how we can help her, little issue as well"---it had been a week since the test and midoriya could not help grinning, she had taken out a ton of robots, made a show of taking down the 0-pointer as well, she was practically buzzing with excitement even if her teacher wasn't around to share it with her. when her mother came sliding into the living room with her letter from UA, An anxious feeling welled up in her, maybe she hadn't smashed enough robots? what if taking down the 0 pointer was a bad thing? all of these things ran through her mind as she sat down at her deskopening the envelope revealed a small metallic disk, midoriya was confused for a moment before a massive hologram of all might himself appeared, scurrying back and letting out a surprised yelp, the larger than life recording of her idol spoke congratulations, she had made it into the school, and not only that but shed scored the highest out of anyone on the practical exam! with that, and a brief aside where all might asked how many more there were left to record, the disk shut off, izuku and her mother were overjoyed and decided to go out and celebrate, inviting out mitsuki and her husband as well, in the months since Bakugous disappearance the two had been through many hardships but with the gentle encouragement of the elder midoriya that had pulled through somewhat, in fact mitsuki looked more radiant than ever, her hints over dinner said it was thanks to a certain fruit that they'd been introduced too by the one they now rented out Bakugous old room too. It was apparently so delicious mitsuki had begun a small garden of the fruit, but refused to share when inko prodded if she could try some.the evening was joyous, and time seemed to slip by afterward, midoriya occasionally felt her hunger rising up but thanks to mirko, she had found a way to deal with it, through their "experimentation" midoriya found that by masturbating with extreme regularity she could stave off any of the "hunger" building up in her, but having know Mirko's touch and body, doing it herself just felt like a poor imitation, but it worked. Midoriya theorized this could be due to whatever "Energy" she seemed to give off that powered both her powers and sex drive could also be drained. Azzy supported the theory but also claimed that going out and having lots and lots of sex would work better. midoriya felt inclined to agree but she feared what the repercussions would be if a less-than sympathetic hero caught onto her this time. she had been lucky once but she doubted she could be lucky again. as the first day of her high school hero work arrived, midoriya donned the Uniform of UA, a simply and almost humble grey skirt and jacket, and headed for the door, as she was about ot step outside however, the elder midoriya inko held onto her daughters hand, "izuku" she looked down seemingly unable to look her daughter in the eye before rallying and smiling up at her, "good luck sweetie!" there seemed to be much left unsaid, but the younger midoriya simply smiled back and nodded, "right!" before running out the front door, quietly the elder midoriya made 2 cups of tea,  and bringing them over to a quiet corner of the room, there sat a small humble shrine with a portrait of a man with curly black hair, inko set down one of the mugs on the shrine and kneeled in front of it herself, sighing as she spoke to it, "i wish you were here, there's so much i want to say to her.." with that, the elder midoriya quietly sipped her tea with her husband, or as closely as she could---as midoriya arrived in front of the class 1-A room, she marveled at the size of the door, "oh wow, i can actually fit through this one!" though to most it wouldn't be anywhere near a notable feature, for midoriya who had been ducking and swerving through doors for the last 6 months, being able to simply walk through one was a welcome change, as she stepped through the door she took an immediate note of her new classmatesthe first she noticed was the robotic boy, apparently giving instructions for how to properly sit in a desk to another student, a relaxed looking boy with blonde hair who was complaining that class hadn't even started yetThere was a girl with pink skin and small adorable horns speaking to another girl with short cropped hair and strangely dangling earlobes, the pink girl was the first to turn to midoriya and call, "oh hey! love your style!" following this compliment, the short haired girl merely turned over, her eyes widened for a few moments beholding midoriya but she quickly looked awaythere was a rather plain looking boy whos only notable feature was his strangely long and thick tail, talking to another who had rather shiny and well kept hair, the latter was speaking of style and sparkling with a heavy accent, things which the former boy seemed terribly confused on, and why he was speaking of themthere was a boy with hair that jutted up like a cliff overlooking the ocean speaking to a girl with a softly rounded face and simple brown hair, "-and it was so damm flashy! i wonder if that girls gonna be in this class!" to his wishes, the soft faced girl looked around and then pointed at the door where midoriya was stood, where it could then be seen she had some sort of odd pad at the end of her fingertip, "wait, isnt that her?" to her pointed, the red hairs boy whirled around and gasped, "it is! what are the chances of that!?" he would marvel at the sheer good luck of itthe shouting of the red haired boy seemed to spook another boy nearby, he had an oddly shaped head, whereas the red haired boys hair merely looked like stone, this ones skin and head were a more complete illusion, but he also seemed rather timid, jumping slightly to the shouting of the red haired boy, sitting close to him was a girl with dark green hair and strangly large eyes and hands, who looked back at him and seemed to let out an inquisitive ribbitThere was a boy with strangely thick lips talking to another who covered his mouth, but had 6 arms, the former seemed to be describing how a scone is made while the latter seemed to be quite engrossed in the conversation, while nearby there was sat a boy with white and red hair staring at the two, he actually seemed to be listening as well but made no effort to put himself in the conversation. A boy with straight black hair that hung down a bit long seemed to be demonstrating his quirk as he had rolled his sleeves up to show his oddly circular elbows, from which he was producing tape. actually spinning some out onto a little cardboard tube and handing it over to a bird headed boy, who put it into his own bag, "thank you, i had forgotten to pick some up before school" while behind him rose up a shadowy figure that remarked, "shouldn't have stayed up all night reading bers-" the shadow was quickly stuffed back down to the ground, as hard as the bird-headed boy tried to play it off with cool nonchalance, it simply wasn't workingthere was the grape haired boy she had bumped into before the orientation, who was staring at a girl with very dark hair and a quite impressive chest to rival midoriyas own, this seemed to be the subject of the boys staring.finally there were the last two in the class, what looked like a floating uniform and next to her, a very elegant looking girl with long green thorny vines for hair, as midoriya had entered the classroom, this girl had shuddered uncontrollably, drawing the attention of the floating uniform next to her, who asked, "whoa, did someone just step on your grave or something?" the plant haired girl would shake her head, "no, no, but someone might as well have, i feel a great surge of sin and vice around me" her eyes at first flickered over to the purple haired boy, who looked as though he couldn't be happier, but when her eyes landed on midoriya here gaze could be felt sharpening, before the uniformed girl slapped her on the back, this shock took her out of whatever mindset she had been putting herself in, as the invisible girl said, "well shake it off! its the first day and you cant be having jitters like that! come on lets make it a good day!" with her cheery optimism, the vine haired girl seemed to be cheered up slightly, "yes, let us make it a good day"As midoriya stared out across her various classmates she felt a surge of curiosity come into her, so many varieties and differences in bodies and quirks, a few mutation types, but others were less obvious, she wanted to ask so many questions, but she would stow her questions for later as behind her, she felt a new presence. behind the podium of the class, what looked like a giant caterpillar had pulled itself up, this giant caterpillar turned out to be just a very tired looking man in a sleeping bag, but he wasted no time, simply announcing, "ill be your homeroom teacher, get yourself into some gym uniforms, we're taking a test" there were a few moments of silence before the whole class erupted with, "ALREADY?!" in the shred mutual shock and disappointment only a student can feel. 
  
    Chapter Text
    Class 1-A was dragged out of their homeroom and to the gym locker rooms where they were to change into their gym clothes for a day 1 test. Each was grumbling in their own right about wanting their first day to be easier, but no amount of groaning and whining would change their situation, but there was one among them who was not complaining, at least vocally. Izuku midoriyas eyes remained glued to the wall and away from  her classmates as she changed for one simple reason. They were all so dam attractive! Midoriya had found she did like girls some time ago when she caught herself staring at the rather shapely and rounded ass of a classmate but this was ludicrous! Top to bottom each of her classmates had a great figure of curves, good skin and soft hair. Having had to sustain her new hunger on her Wand had been hard enough but now around her there was a bountiful feast in front of her. She felt her body heating up but quickly pushed it down with the mental control gained through her months of training. While midoriya fought against her instincts, she herself was being stared at ,or rather ogled. by a few of her classmates. Tsuyu had felt and oddly sweet scent coming from her and kept occasionally glancing at her, wondering if she had some kind of perfume on? Jirou's eyes kept drifting up and down midoriyas back, peeking at the backs of her breasts, large and bountiful enough to be seen from behind at certain angles. As well as her perfectly bubbly butt which has pounced its way into her head and wasn't leaving without a fight. The Final set of eyes belonged too Ibarra, would found herself turning her eyes towards midoriya and her brow creasing into a brief glare, but when she tried to investigate a reason behind this, she found herself unable to explain it. once all of the young students had changed, they were brought outside and given a brief lecture by their teacher, none other than the mysterious and rarely seen hero who only midoriya recognized, Eraserhead. his gaze wandered over the class, "you're all familiar with fitness tests by now right? well in this one, i want you to use your quirks" a murmur of excitement rippled among the class as he produced a special looking baseball, pointing to midoriya then, "you, throw this ball, hard as you can" midoriya, with her reflexes, managed to catch the ball with ease, judging by his pointing to a space in front of him, she jogged over to it. once there, Eraserhead backed up and took out what looked like a stopwatch and motioned for her to throw midoriya had played some baseball for gym class before so this wasn't her first time pitching, but feeling her classmates eyes on her back, she felt a prickle of worry go up her spine. for some reason they all seemed to be watching her with more intensity than she had expected for being the center of attention. Calming her nerves as much as she could, she put her arm into a simple pitch, thrusting the ball forward into the air as it sailed out of view swiftly. ___ downtown, A man was standing in front of his newly acquired window shop for windows. a confusingly made but lovingly crafted store made entirely of glass. he stood with his hands on his hips proudly, "Well, it took 4 years to get my license to use my quirk for this place, but its finally done!" he walked over to the centerpiece of his shop, a curved Glass sculpture of all might, "With this i can definitely draw in some customers!" the sculpture showed all might defeating a villain that head appeared some time ago, po-si-don-juan the seaductor, and the scene of all might smacking him with his own sexy trident while running along the conjured wave he used to ride into crime. from behind the man came a fastly whizzing object that careened along the curve of the wave before shooting back out of the open doors of the store that it'd come from. The store owner looking around only for a brief moment before shrugging and officially opening --- Eraserhead continued staring at the stopwatch as its numbers ticked up and up before stopping it, turning it around to the class, showing the absolutely absurd number of miles midoriyas thrown ball had gone, over 1000! most of the class was left in stunned silence as Eraserhead continued, "like i said, ill be graded your physical capabilities with your quirks in mind. because out in the field you need that advantage to take on threats from villains, take for instance midoriya here, what would you be able to do if she was a villain?", the question caused midoriyas head to sharply turn in the direction of her new homeroom teacher for this question, only for him to silence her upcoming "what?!" with a glare that reminded midoriya of a grim specter Ida tenya, known to midoriya at this time only as "that robotic boy" raised his arm, "pardon me! but my personal strategy would be to outpace her and deliver a series of smaller but continuous blows until she was unconscious!" Eraserhead would nod to this plan as if evaluating it, "its simple, but possibly safe with your quirk, and might even work, but there's the factor of midoriyas speed" with that, Eraserhead turned to midoriya once again, pointing over to a track field nearby the outdoors area, "go over there and run a hundred meter dash, as fast as you can, you'll be timed" not wanting to question his instruction, midoriya did as he asked, walking over to the track and getting into a runners position, taking off into a full frontal charge down the field, it felt like barley any time had passed before she reached the hundred meter mark. Eraserhead once again showed his device to the class, showing midoriya had run it in an absolutely blistering 6 seconds!  Even Ida felt his stomach bottom out at that kind of speed, observing midoriya run he felt as through he were watching a bulldozer boosted on nitrous. Eraserheads mouth split into a grin that felt more at place on an uncanny animatronic than his face as he said, "Midoriya is going to be the benchmark for this test, her physical capabilities are pretty similar to a lot of villains, if i feel you wouldn't be able to stand up to her, you'll be expelled"  This statement caused an eruption of protests from Class 1-A including from midoriya herself who shouted, "w-wait! i never said id be part of that!" once again, Eraserheads gaze turned towards the towering trainee as he coldly stated, "This is the kind of freedom granted to UA teachers. if you hold back even a little bit. you'll be the one whos expelled. I'm not letting unprepared trainees out into the field" with that, his grin returned, "lets begin What followed was an absolutely harrowing first day for class 1-A, Midoriyas physical capabilities were nigh ludicrous. when it came to measure grip strength her mechanical dumbbells snapped in half like a twig. The standing long jump resulted in midoriya nearly landing on mineta, who seemed surprisingly disappointed by the miss. in sit-ups, repeated side steps and even the distance run. Midoriyas strength, speed and physical capabilities dwarfed each of her classmates, causing a profuse stream of apologies as midoriya tearfully expressed her remorse as she absolutely smoked her competition. By the end of it midoriya could only bow her head to the ground as the rest of the class looked more like a group of condemned prisoners than those who had been prospective heroes just an hour prior.  The results were pretty clear. Barley anyone had passed Eraserheads test. only Todoroki, Momo Shoji and Ibara (to her own surprise) would stand a chance in Eraserheads eyes, turning to the rest of the class who sat slumping and defeated, he said, "well with this in mind, by the end of this year, ill be expecting each of you to be able to have passed this little test" idas hand immediately went up as he said, "but teacher! you said anyone who did not meet your standards would be expelled! how can we attend classes or re-take your test if we aren't even in school!?" this brought Eraserhead a grim smile as he said, "oh that? that was just a logical deception is all" the way he spoke of it was casual, almost dismissive, but his face told the real story as class 1-A shouted collectively their frustrations at having been tricked.  --- Whatching from atop one of the school buildings, azzy stared down amongst the students, moving her finger from right to left amongst them like a picky eater deciding what to get at a restaurant, "hpm hpm hpmmmmmmmmmmmmm" her finger settled on the fidgeting jirou, the nervousness of passing or failing gone, now she was left only with frayed nerves as azzy mused, "she seems stressed, i think i can fix that" Down on the ground Eraserheads instincts kicked up as he sharply turned towards one of the nearby rooftops, he quirk flashing to life as his eyes glowed red for a moment. upon seeing nothing, and nothing being revealed, he suspiciously gazed back at his complaining students as he called. "hit the showers. get to your next classes and think on these results" with that, he walked off almost carelessly around a corner, leaving his students to grumpily go to the showers.  Walking a bit slower than the others, jirou was an easy target for the invisible azzy who, extending her palms out towards the unsuspecting girl. Speaking in a tounge known only to her, a dart of light flew from azzys palms and into the side of Jirou's neck, causing her to flinch and swat at what she thought was a bug, seeing nothing on her palm, she glanced around before continuing on. unaware of the spell now coursing across her body. --- It was in the changing room when jirou began to feel hot, her head felt like it was burning up, nearby, mina ashido turned towards her new classmate and said, "whoa, are you okay? you look like you just ran a marathon!" it was true as well, Jirou's body was hot and sweating, and her attempts to re-button her shirt had showed several miss-aligned buttons, with minas words, the other girls began to take notice. each chiming in their own worry. A quick report to Eraserhead granted jirou a note to the nurse and she was off.  once inside the nurses office Jirou's temperature was taken and deemed to be not major, but warranting a nap and an ice pack. With the chilling ice on her forehead, jirou was left to rest alone with a privacy curtain around her bed. As she laid there her mind began to wander to and fro, thinking on how it seemed to be an almost cruelly sucky way for her to start her Hero academia. Tricked by her own teacher, Outdone and outclassed by a girl her own age with an absurdly strong quirk and even better body, especially her body. how it moved, how her curves wiggled when she started blubbering her apologies. The way her skirt fell across her ass that swayed when she walked. Its at this point that jirou recognized the direction her thoughts were wondering, frustration and admiration of the midoriya girl. She was absolutely monstrously strong but seemed pretty kind and friendly, even meek. But when her body got to work? there was focus and power there. like she could lift up the whole world if she wanted too, or jirou off the ground and pin her to a wall. Unable to bear the heat in her cheeks anymore and desperately wishing to go to sleep, jirou devised a plan. she checked outside of her privacy curtain for any signs of others in the infirmary, even checking the other beds. the nurse, A rather kindly old lady with a syringe walking stick, had said she needed to had out to help with "some nonsense about a manga boy" getting stuck underneath his desk due to incredibly bad luck. so she knew shed be alone for a few hours. With her bases covered jirou laid on her chest, moving the infirmary beds pillows to hug it to her chest with one arm, while her other hand pulled the thin blanket over her form, now concealed and in a convincing sleeping position, jirou put her plan into action, unbuttoning her skirt and letting it fall away under the covers, leaving her all but naked save for her sock and panties, both of which were completely plain and white. once again glancing around nervously jirou wondered if she wasn't just being crazy, This kind of thing felt unthinkable and yet, there she was doing it all the same, skirt undone and hand gently massaging her eager pussy restrained beneath white cotton. She rationalized it as the stress of the day and hoped that by the time her caretaker came back the stains would have dried. With this she convinced herself things would be fine and began pressing the pillow into her chest above while burying her face into it, while her legs pressed together under the covers, her hips moved forward into her pressuring hand and it wasn't long before she began to moan into the pillow Jirou's ear-lobes were unique, her quirk had manifested as solely her mothers, not an unheard of thing but certain not common either, the extended down into long thin cables she could push or stretch as she needed and at their tips were two small but sharp earphone jacks, using these, she sent her jacks down to assist her hand in pushing her panties down, and then around the curve of her hips, pulling up on them tightly like a thong would but leaving her pussy wide open, which was perfect for her groping hand which immediately went in and began stroking along the length of her pussy, jirou wished her jacks could be longer, her mind delving into fantasies of being wrapped and tied up in knots It was at this time that midoriya had entered the infirmary, School was over and, feeling concern for her classmate and wishing to further apologize. She had come looking for her, As soon as she entered the infirmary her senses picked up something, the smell of pleasure. Raising her head higher she could feel it was a girls juices, Semen's scent was far more pungent and enticing, but the delicate scent of womanhood had its own charms, ones she followed to a curtain covered bed, peeking through the curtain with the stealth one wouldn't expect from one of her size (those lessons on sneaking with rumi had really paid off), midoriya saw what would be at first glance to be jirou simply having some kind of dream, but midoriya knew better, and the shape of her quivering legs under the covers told her everything she needed to know by now, midoriya had been starved since rumi had left, she had been trying her best to follow her teachings and prevent another incident like before, but when the world throws a bone, its only polite to take it, midoriya opened the curtains, the ring of the curtain ring rolling across the bar startled the pleasuring jirou, who opened her mouth to give an explanation or question, only to be silenced by the strong hand of midoriya, who held a finger up to her lips, moving the curtain closed behind her with her other hand before moving it to press into the cheek of the startled jirou, her eyes sharpening and thinning like a predators once again as she whispered to jirou, "it'll be just between us" in a tenderly soft voice. the words entered Jirou's ear like a tickle, and soon midoriya was atop her, holding her head secure against the bed with her warm hands and being made to stare up.  As jirou laid there she felt a sense of helplessness, she was in the hand of someone who could fold her like a pretzel, caught in the act with barley an excuse and now being stared into with the oddly intense gaze of midoriya, and yet her body would not  stop shaking from excitement. The sweet scent of midoriya had finally pushed her being far enough to abandon all reason, unable to voice any defense or plea she simply relaxed her body, leaving it open for midoriya to take as she wished, waiting and staring up at her with a look of quiet need. Midoriya wasted no time enflaming Jirou's passion, taking one of her hands into her own and gripping it, she brought it up to her face to smell, the lingering scent there was as intoxicating to midoriya as a steak to a starving man, and soon, one of Jirou's fingers had been wrapped up into the soft maw of midoriya, her soft lips pressed around the knuckle while her tounge glided along the bottom, cleaning it off and demonstrated what it could do quite expertly at that, this was done to each of Jirou's fingers one by one before her hand had been clean. It had been a good appetizer, but the taste had only made midoriyas hunger grow as her eyes trailed down to jirou's legs. In spite of her co-operation they were still pressed together, rubbing like two sticks trying to make a fire. This would not do as the hungry midoriya would demonstrate, looking jirou in the eyes once more, she held the helplessly enraptured girls hand up to her mouth and pushed her tounge out, the wagging, wet and incredibly flexible organ pushed along and aside two of jirous fingers, flicking its tip up and down while jirous face flushed in realization. midoriya then pointed down between jirous legs while her tounge continued to violate the air, promising it for her if she'd open her legs. IT would only take a few more moments of consideration before jirou followed these instructions, her legs creaking open slowly. Allowing entrance for the hungry beast that was midoriya She started slowly, kissing Jirou's belly as she slowly slider herself down onto the bed, midoriya was struck with an odd sense of deja vu as she continued. When she at least arrived with ehr head between jirous legs, midoriya practically had to pull her legs under her in a squat to fit on the bed. midoriya took a second to appreciate the sight before her, between jirous legs was a pussy absolutely pink with inexperience but puffy with need, a quick flick to its side showed a minor gush of liquid from inside, she was fit to burst by now and midoriya would be the one who tipped those scales. with her tounge outstretched midoriya plunged it into jirou like a spear, pushing it in first as her lips closed around the top and bottom while the tip of her tounge scraped and stroked along the top of her pussy, causing jirou to gasp in surprise and reach her hands down, clinging onto midoriyas head and trying futilely to push her off in shock by the sudden attack. their complete obsession with each other was killed as both became aware of the distinctive "click" of a door handle turning. Using her quick reflexes, midoriya jumped into action, pulling Jirou's and her own clothes back up and slapping the blanket over her before throwing herself off the bed and onto the chair next to it, while putting her hand over Jirou's mouth to muffle her still escaping moans. with barley a second to spare, jirou came to her senses and became silent as midoriyas hand pulled away to rest on her lap as the curtain was opened to reveal the diminutive (and old) recovery girl.

The aged nurses eyes flickered from deku to jirou with a raised eyebrow as she spoke, "oh, pardon me, i didn't see you had a guest, nor did i see her enter" midoriya bowed her head in apology quickly, both because she sincerely meant it, and to buy her tounge time to lick jirous juices from her face, Hidden behind her long bangs she spoke, "im very sorry! i became concerned and entered in without thought!" only for this apology to be met with the dismissively waving hand of recovery girl, "its all fine. i should be the one apologizing for barging in" she then went over to jirous bedside, looking her over recovery girls hand went to her chin as she said, "hpm, you do seem better, but you still seem to have a bit of a fever, if i were you id stay home tomorrow and see how your condition goes from there, ill let the school know dear" with that, she began to stroll away from the bed, turning to midoriya to say, "one last thing, if you could, would you mind helping her get home? itd certainly put me more at ease"

with this request, jirou and midoriya shared a brief look, though jirou had been shocked out of her dazed state, midoriya could still feel the lust in her eyes, and so turned towards the small nurse and gave her a nod. soon escorting jirou out of the infirmary. once outside of UA jirou fiddled nervously with her earjacks as she walked staring at her feet, eventually she would open her mouth to speak, but midoriyas hand reached down and grabbed the entirety of her left ass cheek, saying ,"you don't have to say anything, i know you want it, and I'm going to be taking this tonight, are your folks home?" as jirous cheek was grabbed, she could feel the strong fingers of midoriya digging into her soft flesh there, and tugging at both of her holes beneath her panties, biting her lower lip in need she would shake her head, they were out on a business trip and wouldn't return until tomorrow. The shaking of her head was all midoriya needed, as she let go of Jirou's ass and the two walked to her home together

---

As jirou slide out her key to unlock her front door she was well aware of the eyes burning a hole in the back of her skirt, the entire walk over here midoriya had felt less like the nervously apologetic girl she had seemed like during the quirk apprehension test and more like a starving animal. A comparison not being helped by how her pupils had narrowed to slits and her hands kept caressing around and holding her neck, but jirou didn't think too hard on this as whatever had made the heat course through her body had now claimed her head as well, occupying it only with thoughts of rough, bed breaking sex. 

Once the door was opened and the two were inside jirou was lifted up from behind and thrown onto the living room couch, before she knew it midoriya was on top of her, ripping the front of her shirt open and scattering the buttons to the floor as she did the same to her own shirt, pressing her chest down into jirous as she felt the absurdly soft and cushiony breasts of her classmate massaging her own with their weight, and also pining her there. 

midoirya began to push her chest up jirous body, her erect nipples carving a path up and along it until finally, they rested above her mouth, with their greater weight resting on the rest of her head as the trained hand of midoriya went to the top of her head and began soothingly patting and petting her, while her voice dropped down to a husky calming whisper, "i know you're nervous, but let me take the lead here" while her hand undid jirous skirt, the young girl opened her mouth to try and speak, only to find it now full of breast and the most delicious scent she had ever smelled, she began licked at the tit not pressing into her mouth, while her arms wrapped around midoriyas chest, pulling herself closer to breath in more of her

as midoriya watched jirou cling to her like a pole in a tornado, she remembered her lessons with Miruko on how best to deal with a nervous partner in bed, having taken the lead and assured the nervous but eager girl, midoriya went to work, the tighter jirou clung and the more desperately she sucked at midoriyas breast, the more she felt like her hunger was being satiated, when her finger began to slide along jirous wet pussy however, the way she trembled and shook while clinging to her set something off inside midoriyas head. When she had been with miruko the rabbit hero remained strong in bed, despite midoriyas best attempts with her hands, mouth and hips the rabbit hero always felt like she was on top, but the girl before her was now trembling and shaking to what midoriya was doing to her, surrendering to the pleasure she provided. It drove midoriya wild

her fingers slide in and out of jirou with the ferocity of a piston, while the young girl felt as though she were being rammed by a sledgehammer with each thrust her hips wouldnt stop shaking, her eyes couldnt stop trembling and struggled to stay open as a feirce fiery pleasure began building up between her legs, and it was spreading, she felt the pleasure not just in her legs, but spreading to her arms as well, her chest, her head, its as if her entire body was feeling the pleasure ramming into her from midoriyas fingers, all while she sucked away at the tit in her mouth like a newborn

the strange pleasure in jirous body began to build, she could barley contain herself from screaming out, yet behind the orgasms and rolling unfocused eyes her face now held, there felt as though there was something even bigger building up in her, when midoriya lifted up off of her and began to lift jirous leg up, sliding her own leg through this new opening, and now pulling off her skirt and panties to expose herself. Jirou felt as though she were going to melt from the heat she felt coming from midoriyas crotch, and when it met hers the building sensation inside of her finally exploded as midoriya began to rub her pussy against jirous, the two's juices mixing as they rubbed into each other

It was then when the transformation started, jirou felt her arms and legs getting a big longer and spotted odd growth pumping up along her skin, soon sprouting like flowers were feathers and the end of her hands began to curve and become covered in bird-like scales. her legs began to change also, shifting and changing into large bird feet reminiscent of an eagles, from the back of her hips sprouted tail feathers and around her head grew long wild looking hair, as these changes came, so did jirou, her body exploding and bursting with pleasure, while midoirya also began to tremble

As jirou began to change midoriya was at first shocked by the sight of it, but then by the magnitude of energy she felt coming off of the girl it was as though she were sat in front of a roaring fire consuming her love, but at the same time it felt shockingly good, the hunger thatd seized midoriya was satiated and then some as this wave of energy washed over her. filling up her mind and body with pleasure, as though her entire body were being massaged by expert hands and her insides were burning up, a sensation she had almost forgotten from when her own transformation took place

as midoriya laid on her back, panting and tired from having creamed her guts out, she took stock of the jirou in front of her, her legs longer and suppler, her arms now coated in long feathers and hands like talons, and her head now boasting long wild looking locks of hair, her chest hadnt changed much and it was clear it was still jirou, but now passed out and covered in her own and midoriyas juices. 

With her mind cleared of the haze of hunger thatd been clouding it, midoriya also took notice that the couch she had thrown jirou on had been broken from the force of her orgasming hips, the legs laying uselessly on the floor, that seemed to be the only bit of property damage she had caused, but as she began to access what to do about this, the door behind her clicked open, and midoriya heard a mans voice calling out, "im home! jirou?"
