    *She Still Remembers the day like yesterday, she will never forget what happened on that day 5 years ago.* They were kneeling on the floor with hands behind their heads, looking at the floor, in front of him, where he was sitting in a golden throne and sorrounded by the death eaters and the bodies of professors, weasley family and some students. The war was over, harry was dead, hogwarts burned to the ground into ashes. After neville was hit with a curse by an death eater, while trying to destroy the snake. Harry was killed by voldemort. Many of the light side was killed and the dark magic invaded beyond the borders of the wizarding world. The first pure blood family to get arrested was the weasleys and some of the important professors were arrested too along with the remaining golden trio and ginny. Hermione, ron and ginny were the ones kneeling before him by binding magic. Just moments before, the trio watched the weasley family and the professors getting tortured and killed, they screamed and begged him to leave them, but she also know it was music to his ears. Ginny showed no more life in her face, just a breathing body after watching her family and love of her life getting killed before her eyes. Rons eyes were full of rage, she knows if it wasnt for the spell, he would have lounged himself on voldemort and eventually get himself killed. Hermione dont know what to do, she wants to just save the remaining loved ones, she lost one of her best friend and she cant lose the other who is also her love. "My lord, the oldest wizards and witches are dead, only the youngest remains from hogwarts, and this trio was the closest to that boy who helped him, the girl with the red hair was his girlfriend. Give me a chance my lord, we would shatter them to pieces" lucius said.The death eaters around them were licking their lips and drooling at her and Ginny. "Oh lucius, i have no problem in killing them, but we should not waste a brilliant mind of the mudblood witch to the pit of the land" the silky voice of voldemort said. She knows they are talking about her, she could feel the fear rising inside her and the heat of the rage ron was feeling beside her. "Ms. Granger" he said and released her binds, she stood, suddenly ron yelled "If you touch her, i will.....mmph" his mouth was shut with spell.  "Ms. Granger, i  don't intend to waste such as extraordinary mind, you will join me and I will spare the life of your friends or you could die with them". "I'll join you" she said without hesitation, ron looked at her shocked and ginny let out a single tear drop down the floor. "Good decision Ms. Granger, but you obey my orders, prove it and I'll grant your first wish without any second thoughts" voldemort said. "I'll do it, what should I do?" She asked ready for anything, she was tired of fighting, she just wants to save them, save her friends, save her parents, save her love. "Kill one red head" he said and hermione felt the earth shatter around her, ginny started crying and ron started to blabber something, which when lifted the curse could easily understand was "Hermione please kill me, please i beg you, please!!".  She had no other options, she have to do this. Atleast she could save the others and pointed her wand which was given to her now at ron, her lips quivered, tears were flowing freely. "Sorry ron" she said and with every ounce of courage she could muster, she said the killing curse "Avada kadavra". A limp body, lifeless slumped on to the floor, where she screamed painfully at the hands of Bellatrix. She know the after effect she will have, but she couldn't do it, couldn't kill him, the lifeless body was ginny. She killed ginny. She said it again "I'm sorry ron" and met his eyes which was full of tears, angry and hate turned towards her, only her. The death eaters clapped and voldemort said "Well done Ms.Granger, now you can have your wish" . "Release ron and let him go" she said, suddenly dark lord used a spell on ron and made him faint, but even at the last second before his eyes closed he glared at her with a amount of hate, she would never experienced in her life. "Leave him at the outskirts of our land, i don't want to see him again" he said and two death eaters took a dizzy ron and they disapparated.

    Draco was sitting in his room at malfoy manor, he is now the head of the control of sending the new slaves to their respective masters. He was checking the files of tax payed by the owners of the slaves, he sent to them under the orders of his wife hermione, who is called as the dark witch by the people around the empire. His wife lives in the castle, which was the ex-ministry building, after the dark magic took every inch of the world including the muggle world, many changes were came upon my his wife, men were treated as slaves and whores. Women's are maids and sluts, but there were respect for the women. Men were treated so low, they lost their freedom to complain or fight for anything. Even he got the job only because he is her husband, not respect but just out of sympathy. Women can do whatever they want to the men of the world, they are the only one allowed to do magic. Every home has the men under women's control, a women can have as many men she want may as husband or as slaves. If a boy crossed his age of 18 he lose would his freedom and he should be made has a whore and will be sold at the market place, after that according to his service they will be imprint his quality as a husband or slave in his chest by iron rod. If any men, were to be stand against the empress their organs will be replaced that of a women. Hermione really hated men and the main reason for it was he and his father. He thought of the day before five years, when he married hermione granger as she was announced as mrs.malfoy by the dark lord. He still remembered the day he married the beautiful muggle born he loved so much since the 4th year yule ball, but he hide it well from everyone. He seen her break before him, when he said 'I DO' on that day.Dark lord gave his mark to hermione too. He rembered how she cried on the day they were bonded through dark magic marks. He also remembered how she cried on his bed when he took her virginity and knows who she was thinking of. It hurt him so much, that she still thinks of him. But he believed it would eventually change if she showed some love to her. After the first time he decided to maintain distance physically to first take his place in her heart. But he and his father couldn't control their lust. Many muggle borns and witches were captured. They were made as slaves collored and they spent their day in his bed. There were nearly 20 slaves for him he took each on his bed daily, he enjoyed their screams when he took them. He could also hear the screams from the next room where his father were taking his slaves.  Actually his father made their lives hell, he will make the women (married or not) comply to his wishes by punishing/killing their husband or boyfriend before their eyes and take them before their spouse. He killed all the men secretly he knows that too. Draco could have had sex with lots of slaves, but his heart belong to the witch he married, he never even slept near her, in their bedroom. She was afraid of him.  She was treated as a queen like his mother by all the death eaters guard and the slaves. His mother and his wife shared a intimate relationship. They were so thick like a mother and daughter.  His mother told him how hermione spends most of the time in the library reading dark art books, he was shocked at that, but was happy that she continues her favourite hobby here, he got more books for her. His mother also told him, that his wife was really scared to get out of library, because she could hear the screams of the other womens which made her miserable. He wanted to win her heart, so he stopped and sold his slaves to other pure bloods. But he couldn't control his father, he still continued ravaging his slaves, punishing them, spankings, whippings, publicly humiliating them. Hermione was hating all this, he could see there was a sadness and hate in her eyes not on just his father, but also all the men. All the women in the house were good to her, but except one his aunt bella. She never let hermione sit with them, she always sat on the ground for having food. She always called her mudblood, once they found her parents and made them sit on the ground, forcing them to eat their remaining foods, he could see tears in his wife's eyes. But he can't do anything. He also made a big mistake by requesting his father to stop all this slave nonsense, because it's making his wife miserable. His father went mad at him for supporting the mudblood. He also remember his words 'Draco you were just asked to marry her, not to give her your heart, did you took the virginity of the that creature - He nodded- yes, i did think so, now let me show you how to treat a mudblood slave' and he did. He raped hermione. His own father raped Draco's wife, his own daughter in law. He made her bent on the bench and spanked her with his belt until her pale skin turned into bright red and she was crying so heavily. His mother was crying outside and banging the door to open, he made Hermione's voice louder using magic to make it hear to all inside and outside of the house. And then his father raped her, inserting his penis inside his wife penetrating her again and again, while she was glaring at draco, for being a coward, not rising a voice, but just crying and he was made to have a sloppy second with his wife, when she was lying in the bed as a lifeless body. His aunt was there too, laughing at the whole scene and naming her as 'mudblood whore'. After he was finished they three exited, his mother went in barging with some slaves one or two faces, which he know from school parvathi patel and cho chang, they all went in glaring at him and crying, closing the door shut behind on his face. Then many things happen, which were the real history of the dark witch, the beginning of an evil hermione. He shuddered just at the thought. He closed all the files and signed the papers to sent to the castles, exited his house. Got a carraige with man pulling it, instead of a horse.No man is allowed to sit in the carriages without her special permission which he did have. He took a moment to see all the castles and building surrounding him, they were all built just two years ago, like a empire with roman sculpture all the old buildings were destroyed. He also observed some of the witches standing as sluts for one night, waving at him. He wanted to have sex, but he couldn't without her permission and took a hold of his dick in pain, which is locked in a cock cage.

    Hermione was sitting on her throne at ministry hall, where it is now her meeting hall for her ministers.  Now is not a time for meeting with the ministers, but is time for her lunch with dark lord. He never really stayed at a place once, he always travelled across the world, checking all the counties he gifted to his obedient followers. Hermione is actually jealous of him, even though he gifted the whole england to her and made her the empress, even though she is his favourite among his followers, even though he treat her like his own daughter. She couldn't let go of the jealously of him having so many power and followers. "Your highness" a man with muscled body wearing only his boxers came in bowing before her. He is her servant, bodyguard they were also given to her guests (only women ofcourse) as a treat to enjoy in their bedroom whenever they stay in her castle.  "Mr. Malfoy wanted to see you, should I let him in?". Hermione nodded. The guard still bowing exited the way he just came in through. She scowled at the name of her husband. How it all turned around in just a day. Sure she accepted draco as a friend, but she disgusted his cowardness still. She still remembered her rape done by lucius malfoy. How they three tortured her, how they beat her to near death leaving her bleeding on her nose from the slapping on her face. She for an revenge built a castle for her parents and given lucius as a gift for them, if he didn't obey what they say, he will die, that's the curse she gave him. Draco entered the room with a smile and an uncomfortable walk towards her. Hermione smirked, the rape was the last time she let him touch her, she allowed him having sex with her guards or the maids, but only a month. She is the one holding the key to his cage lock.  She don't know when she did become a dominatrix, maybe it's in her character from hogwarts, but she liked controlling men, torturing them especially with Bellatrix's dark power inside her. "Hermione" draco said and took her hand to kiss at her knuckles. "Draco, why do you want to meet me?" she asked. "Can't i even see my beautiful wife" he asked smiling. "Don't take advantage of the freedom given to you draco, do you want to see me or to get your cock released" she asked rubbing her hands over his flies. Draco moaned from pleasure and pain at her touch and the inability to get erection due to the cage. "It would be so good, if you just released it" he asked quirking his eyebrow.  "Dark lord is here, your highness" her guard said. She came down from her thorn pushed and walked past a drooling draco who was mesmerized at the sight of her. She nowadays usually wears a black dress with slit from the edge of her thighs, which shows her curvaceous body, shape of her pert heart shaped arse and good amount of her handful firm boobs. The sight of her always makes the men around her salute her with their dicks, even her guards (except one, who got his dick cut off when tried to flirt with her) get shameless erections, when she is around. She walked to the front of her castle followed by her husband, where dark lord just arrived, when she saw him she hugged her, it was her special treatment which made other followers of him to get envy of her. "Hermione, my dear, how are you, everything is good?" he asked. "Let's get inside master, then we can talk about my kingdom". she said but voldemort took hold of her waist and led them together, she could tell his touch was sexual. She is shocked, she thought he was seeing her as his daughter, but not in this sense. She also noticed how Draco was glaring at him from behind. They all sat at the dinner table, food were served for the lunch, they started eating their feast "So hermione, say about your kingdom, i heard there is a lot of slaves are transported from here".  "Yes, my lord, the slave business is going really well, we are getting a good lot of taxes from the people too, draco here is the one who manages the business". "Ah.... draco, good boy, just like your father. You are doing that to get into your wife's knickers? Or are you scared that you will lose your freedom and have your dick cut off?" Voldemort asked, Draco's faced reddened with embarrassment and hermione smirked. "Come on draco....I asked you a question didn't i? I already know the answer, but I just want to get you humiliated in front of these guards and maids". "Too get into my wife's knickers my lord" Draco said looking at the floor ashamed. "But why?" "Because she never touched me in four years..." "And?" "And she put a cage around my shaft, only opens it once a month, so I can have sex with one of my slaves or maids" one of the guard in the room smiled and voldemort killed him at that instant. Everyone looked shocked except hermione who just smiled at the body. "Draco, you shouldn't get afraid to speak out, don't you remember what happened at this table four years ago?". Voldemort asked. Draco remembers it well enough, it was the day their fate changed, the true history of the dark witch begin. Four years ago, voldemort was having lunch with them, him, his father, his mother and his aunt bellatrix. Hermione was the one serving instead of the maid. "Mudblood" aunt bella called out "serve some more soup here for my lord", hermione obeyed, dark lord was smiling at her the entire time. "Hermione, doesn't look so happy here, why? Is there any problem?" he asked. "Of course no problem my lord, why would my daughter in law be unhappy?" Lucius replied smiling.  "Maybe she still misses the red head, the weasley" aunt bella said and laughed. Draco know that was an untouchy subject. "After she killed his sister and got him disposed, so that she can marry draco and live like a princess here, who would want to live in the dirt by marrying a weasley, oops sorry there is no more weasleys" and she laughed maniacally. Draco glanced at hermione, she had her hand firmly around a plate knuckles white, angry tears rolling down her cheeks. "And mudblood, that lovely boy, your boyfriend.... do you think he is still alive or would have been shattered into pieces by snat......" She didn't even finish the sentence, before he realized hermione took his wand which was at the table and cast killing curse on his aunt, who fell to the ground lifeless, her maniacal laugh stopped, there was a deathly silence in the room. Suddenly his father stood and made a move to slap hermione, but before that a black smoke from bellatrix death mark transferred to hermione surrounding everyone. "Lucius" voldermort called. "Yes, my lord" his father answered. "Clear out the body first" draco was shocked all this years of loyalty from her to him and this is how he reacts when she dies? he thought. After that voldemort thought many magics to hermione all the money in their vaults were transferred to her, she was made as the queen and he thought he would be the king, but no he was wrong, she made him as her manager of some sort. She punished his father, cut his bits, whipped him with spikes, made him bleed and sent him as a slave to her parents. He himself was nearly an slave for her, an employee with no salary, the only person who was treated normally was his mother. She was made to move out of malfoy manor and into a grand castle hermione built for her. The three of them living in their own places. She searched for ronald weasley for two years and cried almost everyday, as they announced him as dead. But no one could find his body, a body similar to him with red hair was found. Hermione at first declined it was him, but eventually accepted and made him a big rememberence. The cities were destroyed, empires built, castles built, many half bloods, mudbloods died by Hermione's hands if they didn't obey her orders.  Many were made as slaves, maids, men lost all respect and freedom. Inside the castle her guards and men were never allowed to wear anything. Except him and dark lord. He heard of hitler a cruel ruler lived in muggle world, but here his wife a female version of it, controlling the whole england including muggle world.

    It is that day of the month, the day she usually have sex to relieve her lust altogether. It was hard at first, because it was never her spirit, it must have been Bellatrix's, when her power transferred to her, it should also came into her. The lust she feels was not little, she wants to just go on and on, like a nymphomaniac. But she knows how to control it, so she uses the same technique she gave to draco, having sex only once a month, but not with her own husband though. It has just been four years, once a guy for a month, they can have her any way they want, any positions, but should not come until she says, so they usually use cock rings. When there is no one willing she uses one of her guards. No one dares to have sex with her, because they know that the next morning they will be sentenced to death. Its is not necessary to kill them, but she liked doing it. Today it is viktor, viktor krum. The guy that wants her from 4th year hogwarts. Bulgarian quidditch player. This is the first time they are meeting after bill and fleurs wedding, he knows she is the ruler of england. But didn't had time to visit her, as he was so busy in his league's. When viktor arrived this morning, she had no plans of having him. But who can change his fate, if he wanted to be dead. But was an good friend, thats the only thought makes hermione sad. They spent the morning, looking around the castle, in her normal outfit of black dress with black slit, which made every men around her filled with lust, viktor too. They spent the evening, swimming hermione in her two piece bikini, who showed her almost naked. Viktor was in his shorts, showing his firm muscular body with six packs. While in pool at one point, he came behind her and started rubbing his erection on the cleft of her arse, which ignited her lust. She kissed him there hard on the mouth and touched his hard erection which was hot in her cold hands, viktor grunted by her touch. She started stroking him. She kissed him on his mouth, their tongues fighting for domination. As usual hermione won, she felt his body with her other hand, his muscles, firmly packed body, thick long dick looking like an hammer.  He pushed his hands inside her knickers and started stroking vigorously. Thumb circling her clit, two fingers inside her tight cunt stretching her. Hermione moaned. There were two guards by the side of the pool, asusal naked, their erections were high facing the sky. Watching the erotic scene she doesn't mind it, but she knows viktor does. Hermione got out from the pool and stood facing the wall by the side of the pool, she stood there arms pushing against the wall and her back arched. Viktor also got out and stood behind her, got to his knees and started bathing her genitals from her pussy to anus. Tasting her juices and eating her enjoying. She wondered is she that much tasty. When after some more minutes of licking and making her wet enough.Viktor removed her bikini, placed his hand on her waist and made her to kneel on the ground, facing the guards, whose faces are not hiding any lust and desire for her. Viktor stood on his kneels behind her and harshly shoved it in, even though her cunt is soaked, it didn't easily went inside but stretching her. He started thrusting straight away harder and faster, hammering her like there is no tomorrow, stroking her clit with one hand and fondling her breasts with another. "Ah.....Oh....Herm-oh-ninny, you are sooo tight!!" he grunted and used his full force on her, deep and fast as he could. Hermione's is near on the edge, she was moaning and meeting his thrust backward with same force, her round perfect ass shaking, her boobs swaying back and forth. "Oh.....Oh Merlin, yes vikor..... give it to me harder....Harder!!!" She screamed loudly. And he did his long thick hammer nailing her wet skin on skin sounds emiting from their meeting thrust. Suddenly hermione came and cried "Ah..... yes, oh god" she said smiling. Viktor followed a few moments later with a heavy grunt like an animal. It was almost night time, so she asked to join him for dinner, invited him to her bedroom for another session, where they had another amazing orgasms, with her boucing on his cock. The next day, when viktor woke he was so happy, he was sleeping in the biggest bed he have ever seen in his life with the women he desired for years (both naked) hermione granger, the brightest witch of the age and now the empress of england. He started dreaming about their marriage and kids and how he will become the king. Then hermione started stirring on her side of the bed. "Hey sweetheart" he said. She smiled and replied, without opening her eyes "Hi Ron". Though he didn't heard it clearly. She suddenly opened her eyes and saw Viktor krum smiling down at her, leaning down to kiss her. But she pushed him by his chest. He looked bewildered. She stood and got dressed her usual outfit and clapped her hands. Six guards with body just like him and nude came in. They started to get him out of bed with force, without even allowing him the privilege of getting dressed. "Herm-oh-ninny, what is happening?" he asked scared. She walked over to Viktor who was in hold of the men, looking scared. She strokes and kissed his cheek, "You were a good friend Viktor and your dick was good....I will miss you". "I'm a famous quidditch player, you will have to answer to my country" he said narrowing his eyes. "Not before i take the control of your country" she said smiling. She waved her hands and they pushed him out of the room to the place where his death is waiting.

    True to her words, she got to rule the neighbouring lands including Bulgaria, just by flirting with the dark lord. She fixed an meeting with him to speak of her kingdom and just went too unofficial with him. Starting from touching his hand to sitting on one of his thighs, kissing his cheeks, she could feel his hard erection touch her thighs. when he tried to touch her she escaped with having getting the control of other lands.  It was not too much just 3 more countries. But it was too much to other followers, treating her special was one thing, but gifting her three counties? Without even a war or amendments.That's not simple matter. She was making her new plans for the extra countries, eating cookies wearing her expensive silk robe. when draco entered her room. "Be the husband, but u didn't give you any permission to enter my room without knocking" she said. "I'm sorry hermione, but there is a problem" she frowned. "A part of the slaves that were on the move to france went missing, our customers are fuming by owl posts". "Then you know what to do draco, find them, i don't want dark lord to think little of me, because of your mistakes" she stood and dropped her robes, stood nude, Draco's penis got a pain at the sight of her gorgeous body. She clapped two times, then two of the maids entered(one of the two is susan bones he remembered)with her clothing, and put on a jacket and a diamond necklace for her from behind. "Now, I'm going to the opening, don't save the headache for me" she said sternly and walked past him followed by her maids.~~~~~~~~~~The parade was taking place in the main route of the country which led them to heart of the place, where the golden statue of hermione granger is ready to be opened by her own hands. The crowd was very big, all the slaves, maids, the purebloods were around. Even though the pureblood families were the only one with full freedom. Half bloods and Mud bloods are so worst. They were born to live as slaves, maids, sluts and whores. She smiled smugly looking around happy to her the chanting of 'dark witch & all hail the empress' she could hardly believe she was an empress at an young age of 23. She was nearing the opening place, when suddenly a green light passed across her face, she suddenly kneeled saving herself looking around just with her eye, the crowds were running scared, the empress was just escaped from an assassination in public, yes it was the killing curse. Her guards running around, to the direction of light light came. She only allowed the pure bloods to have wand, that too with paying taxes every month for having it. Then she saw him, smirking at her with both hands in his pockets and disappeared suddenly.~~~~~~~~~~"I told you to wait till she reach the statue". One guy said "I'm sorry, i couldn't bear her smug look face" the other said. "Well, you should have, if you waited a few more minutes until my signal, she would have been dead by now". "I said I'm sorry alright?. After all this time, after her betrayal seeing her first time in front of mt mt my eye in four years, do you think I'm can just chant like the other stupids there?". They looked each other for some time "Answer him yourself, when he ask what's gone wrong". Then they both disapparated~~~~~~~~~~~The bathroom was sorrounded by 12 maids standing at the wall, each with some sweet fragrance or bathroom necessities. The two heads of the guards were standing in front of her enormous tub naked, cock erected. Blood dripping from one's head and another's mouth. She finished her bathing, stood and walked out of the tub, wrapped with the towel by her maids. "Your highness we couldn't find them exactly but we know there place is around somewhere in our borders connected to France".  "We went there, but was attacked by two of them, they were stronger and..." Suddenly he fell dead to the tile floor. The other one gulped loudly. "Aren't you ashamed to say this to me, why are you even my guards?" she bellowed at the remaining guard. "Forgive us your highness, they are not stronger to your power, but they had wands, surely they are not purebloods." he replied. She was shocked, she then sent him off and was thinking deeply about it. How could they have wands? If they are not purebloods, then....  Suddenly she remembered, slaves gone missing, Sheamus Finnigan smirking at her at the parade crowd after trying to kill her. "Ollivander". Ollivander went missing straight away, after the war, there was no sign of him at the shell cottage when it was wiped, the death eaters raped and killed fleur along with her husband bill weasley. Interesting she thought "Tell the guards to prepare for my night wandering, i have a mission to complete and also prepare the potion room" she ordered one of her maids.

    Since she become a great power, there were so many resistance group against her, so she sets up these special nights, make her own mission to kill these bastards. She told her guards to wait and hide till she comes back, she drank the polyjuice potion she made which will last for 5 hours and got into an look of an very old lady. She walked slowly to the wards stumbling and blinking, all around her was just trees nothing more, making her remember the horcrux hunt time.  When she entered the ward with her magic of the potion she made. She was surprised, there was another city like place was there, a path way alley of markets and shops, everything was there. Crowded with many people. Who are all these people Why don't i know about these place? She went deeper, but didn't look down. So stumbled again and about to fell down, when two pair of hands caught her and helped her to lift up. It was an women around her own age 22 maybe. She looked like an angel, amazing smile blond hair, pale skin, rosy cheeks, blue eyes with a slight bulge on her stomach. A sack bag on her hands to buy. An exact cindrella figure from muggle stories. "Mam are you alright?" she asked. Hermione shuttered something then said in a older women's voice "Yes, my child, thank you... thank you so much". She smiled again "Oh, it's nothing mam, but where are you from, are you with someone?" she looked around. "No, I'm just a tourist, i don't know how i got here, there were so many trees and suddenly these all appeared" hermione said waving her hands in all direction. She looked like, she realised something "Alright mam, its ok, you should come with me so I can get you safely to where ever you want to go alright?" she asked. Hermione nodded and walked with her, the women looked so nice, so beautiful, she didn't seen anyone behave like this to her since school.  She walked with the women observing her surrounding, she was shocked and surprised by many things she looked and heard. Lot's of children's playing in parks, some practing magic with wands, oh god, muggle parks. They should have inherited the abandoned muggle london parts, collabed with the muggles, they made small houses with the cars, as some of the houses looked destroyed. So she guessed right, they were resistance, preparing even children's, sure she destroyed many resistance but this looked impressive, a hiding place, a city to hide and attack just to kill me, wow, should be ready for war. "Can I know your name mam" the women's question waked her from her thoughts. "Margaret" she replied. "What is your name sweetheart?" she asked, the women replied smiling "Helena, you can call me Helen".  "Where are we going?" hermione asked. "To our leader, the one who can help you to home safely" hermione was excited to see their head, maybe her job have become short. She could just kill him when she meet him she thought having a firm grip on her wand inside her sweater. They reached Helen's home, she knocked on the door, just then a man wearing an apron came out, with a firm tall muscular body, broad shoulder, handsome face, amazing smile, blue eyes and flaming red hair. Hermione lost her hold of the wand, looked shocked.He held out his hand for her "Hi I'm Ronald Weasley" he said and her eyes view become black, she fainted. When she opened her eyes after nearly an hour, she found herself lying in a couch, in a lively good looking living room. She sat up massaging her temples. Sitting before her on an arm chair was Ronald Billius weasley, smiling concern etched on his face. "Are you alright mam" he asked. She couldn't believe it, ron was alive all this time? she felt her cheeks heat up, a giddy school girl feeling, stomach churned with tons of butterflies, she wants to touch him, kiss him, feel him like the air to breathe. "Is she awake?" a soft voice called out from the kitchen interrupting her thoughts, helena came out with two glass one with water and another with wine. One for hermione and one for ron. "Hello Mrs. Margaret, i like you to meet our leader and my dear husband ronald weasley" she said and sat on one of his thighs. 'Surely she can't sit any other places can she?' hermione thought. Hermione felt both feelings at the same time, jealous of helen, for taking over her place, taking control of what belongs to her and angry at ron for trying to kill her all this time as the leader of the resistance. The impatient ron weasley, with the emotional range of teaspoon leader of the resistance. "I don't understand, what are you people? Why is there a ward setup hiding this enormous place with all these people?" she asked innocently. "I know you are confused mam, but let we explain it first" seamus finnigan said walking suddenly inside of the house, like it was his own house. "I think you heard about the dark witch?" he asked, she nodded "I heard about her, got really scared, though never seen her". "Well we are a kind of resistance group of her" "But isn't she your queen?". She asked, ron scoffed. "Queen? Yeah sure. Dirty bitch she is" hermione's rage increasing inside her and she decided to control it for now. "She, harry potter and me were best friends, we fought against the dark lord with many others. After harry got killed. Dark lord catched us, she joined him for her dear life, not even caring about the death of our loved ones, she killed my own sister in front of my eyes, so that she could escape" so that I saved you, you dork!! hermione thought. "She thrown me like a trash from the malfoy manor, married draco malfoy because he was rich and having a good life sucking every guy's dick, that selfish slut" ron said with disdain dripping in his voice, eyes welled with unshed tears. "I got lucky, i beat the death eaters, while they were trying to throw me away from a mountain, took their wands, roamed around the country for months hiding, steeling foods." "Eventually, i found some of my friends seamus, dean and luna with olivander who is a famous wand maker here, he made us wands, we practiced for days, decided to form this resistance, started rescuing the people who were sent as slaves to different places. That's how everything started and we won't back up, until we win, until she is dead." "She only makes deals and gives freedom to pure blood womens and elves, all the males are either will be sex slaves or pet now, squibs will be dead at the moment they were born, womens can have more than two mans, muggles have to pay a large amount of taxes to give birth to their childrens, half bloods and muggle borns are not so good either. We have to stop her atleast now". "You said, she was your best friend at one time, can't you just talk to her?". Luna lovegood walked in, and answered her question for ron "It doesn't work like that, she is not our old hermione, there was always an dark side of her from hogwarts, which that just got a peak, when she got lot of powers, she is evil now". Damn right she is!! "Don't worry mam, you can rest for now, we will take you back to safe place, from where you can get to your country". "Oh, no dear. I have to get back to my husband, i have to go back in two hours" "Here, have dinner with us first, then ron himself will get you back safely" helen said "But i--" ron begin to protest but shut his mouth upon seeing Helen's glare. They moved to the dinner table and started their feast. Hermione felt confused she was overwhelmed by seeing ron again, wanted to feel his love again, felt happy by their behaviour towards a stranger especially helen. But also so much angry. "So, where are your families now, is there any one left?" she asked helen. "Oh, no. Me and she were orphans then, our families destroyed, I'm the last of the weasleys, nearly felt dead and she helped me get me back to myself showing me some love. And we are a family of three now, the weasleys". he smiled. "Three?" but who is the third. Helen smiled at her confused stare and answered, "Im pregnant, with our child" she said smiling with some tears in her eyes. "Actually I'm proud to recreate my family again" ron too smiled sadly and they kissed. Hermione felt herself fuming, if she was her older self, she will be atleast somewhat happy for their baby still jealous & angry at ron. But now, she wanted to burn everyone around her including the baby, he knows where was i and still started a family with another girl. So she decided, at the dawn tomorrow there will be no more resistance. She was now walking beside ron now, after saying her goodbyes to everyone, helen wanted a bless by a women older, so she did blessed her to die silently. She know it's a curse and that's what she wanted. They reached near the ward, "Are you happy about being a father?"  "Oh, yes, ofcourse who wouldn't" "Is there anyone else in your life other than her?". "Yes, there was, i loved her so much, imagined starting a family with her, a combination of our kids" he chuckled "but now I just want her to be dead"  "I did what I should do at that time ron, for saving the love of my life, preserving our future". "Wha-" he was about to ask, what this old women was blabbering about, just before something hard hit him on his back head and his vision went black. He fell to the ground, the older women hovering above him, her face changing into a face of someone familiar to him.

    Ron slowly opened his eyes, even after opening his eyes, it felt dark, like he was blind. He lost his sight, he thought for a moment, then slowly his eyes adjusted to the darkness of the room. He looked around and observed where he was, it was an sort of dungeon the exact replica of when he was imprisoned at malfoy manor, during the horcrux hunt. His wrists ached, he then noticed he was binded to the wall by chains, naked as the day he was born. The cold air surrounding him, entering his pores, fearness creapt into his spine and he shivered from top to bottom. Then suddenly somebody walked into the cell, the fire torches in the room lit, the person got closer, ah there he is the ferret ron thought. "You know, if someone told me some minutes before, there is a weasley left alive, i would have laughed at their face, but now there is one left" draco said and laughed. "I'm not your side kicks from hogwarts, so don't expect me to laugh for your boring jokes" ron replied. "Come on, weasel, just laugh a little. Maybe it could the last laugh of your life" Ron scoffed and showed he wasn't afraid, on the outside. "Oh, i know why you are so confident, do you still think my wife have feelings for you, that she'll let you live, maybe but you will wish to be rather be dead" "Your wife? Oh you mean your mistress" ron laughed "You maybe her husband draco, but the everyone except you know that you are just a slave for her" Draco lunged forward punched Ron's face, his lips broken blood came out and filled his mouth "So? Does beating me got you everything you want?" ron asked calmly. Draco yanked ron backwards by holding his hair "Oh you don't know how much beating brings joy to me weasel, i was longing to find a weasley to have my revenge on you, but I thought all of you are dead and now I'm so happy, I'm going to kill you slowly...... very slowly, you'll beg me to just kill you and done with it" ron smiled. "And then, i will go to your wife, do you want to hear, what I'll do to her?" draco asked raising his eyebrows. Ron spat the blood on his face "you are just as pathetic as you father ferret, if you ever laid a single finger on her, i will make you regret the day you are born" Draco laughed "As if you still stand a chance, your kingdom have been invaded weasel, all your resistance are captured and killed, hermione herself did it, she have a new favourite hobby of killing these kind of resistance by her own hands including muggle ways, i don't know if your wife will be dead by killing curse or by hanging in a tree" draco said and began to walk away from there, he know the weasley will not sleep anymore from hearing that. "She is pregant" draco stopped and looked at him over his shoulders without turning around. "Please don't do anything to her, she is pregnant with my child" draco sighed and walked away.~~~~~~~~~~~The castle was bristling with crowd, filled with everyone from the ministers to the newly captured slave. She had enough of the owls of other dark wizards and witches congratulating her for the clean swipe of resistance in her rule, also a special owl from dark lord himself, praising her and gifting her with tons of gold and one more country. It was really a chaos, the moment she entered inside the ward of the resistance place with an entire army of her guards unfortunately, the alarm broke off and some nearly ten escaped. But she took care of the others, killed all the men except some she knows well for example seamus, captured a lot of women and all the children, her special among them was ofcourse helen weasley, she tried to kill her there itself. But she maybe useful in the future, so she didnt kill her. Hermione was now entering the cell, where ron is now bound to the wall with chains, closely followed by her guards. She looked at his naked form appreciatively, hungrily. She stepped forward and stroked his good sized thick cock with her toes. "well, i must say ron, you look delicious" ron glared and tried to attack her but the chains took hold of him. Ron was disgusted of himself, he must say hermione.... well grown quite into a attractive women, not that she wasn't attractive before, but just at the age of 23, it was surprising. She was more sexy, more thick, her slender thick thighs showing off, her cleavage more than a handful firm breasts and her big firm globes of arse, when she touched his dick with her toes, he slightly started to feel aroused and thought of his wife to avoid the embarassment. "I got a little time for this ron, im going to name punishments for all your resistance party, but lucky for you i have a deal as you were my best friend and we have an romantic side to continue from where we left it off" see im not that bad she thought. "One you can say you still love me and we can be the king and queen of all the land under my control, everything you wanted i can give it to you, no more of your pity resistance group and no more of your wife, i will kill her of course, just you and me...... and our children" "Or else, there is another package for you, which is a surprise for later, so which one?" she asked. Ron scowled "I dont want any deal with you, im not your best friend or lover anymore, leave my wife out of this, you know she is pregnant and......Go fuck yourself bitch" he spat. Hermione sighed "well your wish, what did i expect, i love your stubborness ron, but sometimes you are an idiot" she then turned around, clapped her hands, left the cell without even another glance at him. "Level her alone, hermione, do whatever you want to me, but not her, SHE IS PREGNANT, PLEASE!!!" ron screamed at the top of the lungs as loud as he can for her to here. Suddenly there is a guy looking like a bull entered his cell, muscle filled body, face covered with black cloth wearing nothing but an loin cloth covering his croatch. He walked over to him, lifted his hand to give a blow to his face, the last thing ron remembered before closing his eyes was his child.~~~~~~~~~~~Hermione was sitting in her throne, draco and one of the ministers pansy parkinson sitting before her. Organizing the profile of new slaves, pet and maids. "All right, almost everyone was sorted out, but what about the weasley?" pansy asked draco. "I dont really know, do we even going to let him live?" he asked. "I will buy him, i like to buy him as my pet" pansy said. "No, you wont, you already brought 10pets along with 50 plus slaves and maids, i know a person who wants him, catagorize him as a permanent pet to them" hermione said and draco began to fill the profile. "Come on hermione, even though i brought them, am i not sending one of them every once in a month for you to shag them before killing them, i really want the weasley or tell this persons name, i can talk with them". "The persons name is hermione malfoy, the darkest witch" hermione replied and draco snapped his head. "You can't be serious, you want him for a lifetime permanently? You never brought a pet or slave for yourself, besides what about me?" he asked. "What about you, Draco?" "Im your husband, when was the last time we shagged, do you atleast remember that?" he asked seriously. Hermione laughed "You can't be serious draco, why the slaves in our castles isn't enough for you?"  "I'm your husband, you have to bond him at the same sign of our bond, are you going to just fuck him all your life" he stood from his chair "You are nothing but a slave for me, husband is for just a name, for just this bound made by the dark lord himself, other than that you are simply a cuckold draco and the only reason you are respected by me is your mother, i really don't want to hurt her by killing you" He expected this, he don't know what made him ask, but he did "Alright you can have him, but what about his wife, where is she, there was no information about her, even in this forms, but I know you catched her" "It's not your worry, I'll take care of that"  Draco walked out of the room sulking. He is going to have a long night.

    Draco felt like his whole head was going to blow, he have to take up a sober up potion immediately, after that talk with his wife he had some high drinking. But before that he have an order to follow. He is now on the way to rons cellar, to release him and give him clear instructions. By the time he reached, the room, he saw a muscled up man hitting a dizzy ron repeatedly in the stomach. "That's enough" he said and the man obeyed just like an brainless baffoon and gone out greeting him. "Weasley" he called, no answer. He sighed, he could have just got killed rather than living a pet for his wife. He levitated his body, which is covered full of blood and swollen from the beatings. He walked having the weasley floating behind him, reached the bathroom especially made just for hermione, to bath him by her order. He placed his body above the water and dropped him in. Ron suddenly woke up catching breath, he was in a pool, so big in a bathroom, malfoy looking at him? What the heck!!! he thought then he remembered, everything by far. He saw malfoy clapped his hands twice, just then three maids came in, one of them he knows is susan bones, his former schoolmate. "Come out of the water, weasel, don't you want the medicine to your wounds, or do you like dying rotten?" Malfoy said and ron got out of the water naked before them, he had so many cuts and some parts swollen from the shoe prints. "Make him shine again, he is a special pet for the mistress, if you don't want your hands to be parted from your body....."  malfoy said. Pet?..... Special Pet? How dare she ron thought. Draco gone out, the maids started coming near him "Nah, it's alright, just give me the medicines. I can do it myself". "No, we should do what we told or we'll have our hands severed from our body, please" one of the maid whispered miserably. He nodded. Two of them stood each beside him and started rubbing some kind of fragrance oil, that'll have the cuts gone, but hell it burns. They took care of his upper body, having their soft hands sliding all over him, made his cock erected. What can he do? He is a bloke. Susan kneeled before him, her breath hot on his cock, she noticed his cock and looked him up straight in his eyes and smiled. Ron's face flushed red, his ears turned purple, his freckles stood with humiliation or arousal, he don't know, she started applying the oil on his legs, thighs near his dick and finally on his dick, he shivered from the touch, his precum dripping onto hands, he looked down at her her face red. He needs to change the atmosphere. "Huh.Susan, Susan Bones, do you.... remember me? I'm Ronald Weasley". "I know who you are, but just.... please don't talk loud, we have been ordered not to talk to you or help you, else we three will be killed". she whispered urgently looking back at the doors. He started whispering back "Okay, but please i need your help, i need to find my wife, where are the captures?"  "What's your wife's name?" "Helen. Helen weasley, she is pregnant, i need to rescue her just please help her somehow" "It's not that simple ron, yesterday there were so many captures, they were all sorted into slaves, maids and pet even the childrens, i don't think, she would have been escaped" Ron eyes began to water "Okay, let me search for her, i promise I'll help her........."  "Isn't it over yet?" some guard asked from outside, the two girls beside him looked at susan "Susan, we completed, what are you still doing" "Tell them to give some time, he is almost finished" suddenly she started stroking his dick, the both girls nodded and gone out "I don't want to do this, but this is the only way to continue our talk" she said, he nodded panting "I'm going to search her records don't worry, next time we meet, I'll tell you everything" "Thank you susan, can you tell about what happened to the others" She started telling him, how the muggles were killed then and there and the witches were sorted and sold to other countries, but the wizards and imprisoned for the game day, he aksed what is game day, but she said he'll know soon enough. "You really shouldn't have done this ronald, forming a resistance, sacrificing yourself to save others" she started stroking him fast "I will still do, if it will make her stop......" "That's not it, you could have easily become the king or something, everybody in the castle know what she offered you, atleast you were her best friend and something more, but she is not old hermione, she is so evil bathing in the blood of her rivals, Bellatrix was nothing compared to hermione"  Suddenly he erupted straight straight on to Susan's face with a grunt. "Oh I'm so sorry susan....."  She smiled "Don't worry I'll look for your wife" and not realizing what she is doing she took a swoop of his cum from her lips and swallowed, both their eyes widened by surprise "Ah..... ok ron, nice to meet you bye" she said and ran away Ron was gaping at the door, where she just ran off to, until he met with the guards horrifying glare and he silently stepped into the pool to bath.
  
    Chapter Text
    Hermione knows she was being cruel, he was her best friend and the love of her life and still is. He has a family now, he is so happy that he is going to be a father now, she should move on let him go and be happy, but no she couldn't. She is a human with emotions after all, no one will throw away a life they dreamt of, how would she?. She have everything, she is an empress, dark witch, everyone is scared of her more than voldemort, the powerful (maybe not more than voldemort) witch there is. But all these years there was a sense of loss growing in her, when she saw ron again, a hope began grow in the place of the lose. She want him to love her, she want him to make a family with her, including their babies. This was all the old hermione would do, but the evil side of her wants the same thing with domination.  She wants him to beg her to make love to him, she wants him to be a pet for her, to do everything she says. She feels like he is her possession, wants to take that love from him using force, want to see him in pain and crying when she was on top of him, an animalistic desire to see blood oozing out of his freckled skin. Of course she may have killed the men she used only once a month, but ron is different. She used their bodies, but here she wants his feelings for her only for her. She was sitting in her deeply in thought, then two of her guards brought her pet to her room, they were all wearing only a loin cloth covering their crotch, according to her new order, men will cover their crotch, women will cover their breasts and crotch using the loin cloth. Except her ofcourse. "Place him there" she pointed to an arm chair near the wall of the room facing the bed "and wait outside, be ready to come in when i call you" they both nodded and left. They pushed him towards it, practically throwing him, he turned around facing her and sat comfortably, glaring at her. She licked her lips, looking at him nakedly hungry. His body firm, not so muscles or six packs anything, but fit and pale freckles showing here and there, her name engraved by fire like a tattoo on his chest, because of his permanent ownership. She shut down the urge to lick all the freckles down his body. "Hello ron" "Hello bitch" "I really don't like you talking to me like that, we were best friends remember?" she noted some softness in his eyes at the word best friends. "Oh hell no!! You are not the hermione i know, harry know, if they were all alive now, you would have seen the disgusted reactions on their faces" She closed her eyes and took a deep breadth to calm herself. "Ron, what happened is happened, I'm so happy for you to know you are going to start a family" "Please...... let her go hermione atleast tell me where she is? What about my child" he asked miserably. She stood walked towards him, kneeled in front of him. "Ron I will i promise, but can i ask you a question, will you be honest?" she asked innocently placing a hand on his thighs. Ron looked at her and a fraction of a second he remembered looking at the old hermione, his hermione with watery eyes and apologizing him at third year. He gulped and nodded. "It had been five years, you know I was here and you still didn't even tried to see me once, I'm not asking why, because i know why" He nodded "But what i have to ask you is, do you love me still? Atleast a bit?" "Listen if this was about, the deal you made me earlier, then I........" "No, no ron, i have have to know, i just wanted to know the love of my place atleast have some feelings for me, but be honest" he hesitated slightly. "I promise, i will give your wife and child back to you, please but be honest" she breathed, looking like she was going to cry. Past or present, evil or not, he could not stand to see her cry and he know he still love her deep inside. He nodded. "Say it ron, say it loudly, i wanted to hear you say it" she said. "Yes hermione im still in love with you" he said honesty looking straight into her eyes from where a tear leaked down her cheeks. She wiped her face with back of her hands "i have a wish, i know im asking so much, maybe this'll be the last time we see each other, but I want my wish to come true and after that, i will transport you, your wife and your friends safely across my regions, somewhere safe. I will never come before you, i promise" "Okay"  She raised on her knees by the side of the arm chair, brought her face near his ear on the right side of his face, she smelled of vanilla and beautiful grass field, he thought of burrow and gryffrindor common room. "Make love to me ron, make me feel you inside me, just once" she breathed, her hot air on his ears made him shiver delightfully. She wants me to make love to her, if she asked this before the war, he wouldn't even let her finish the sentence but now, he is married, soon going to be father, it would be cheating. But his inner voice said, if you want to save them then you have to do this, besides you still have feelings for her. He swallowed visibly and said "Okay". She stood by holding his hands, walked slowly backwards towards her bed, pulling him with her. She sat on the bedside near the foot and made him stand between her legs, placed her hands on his shoulders, pulled his face down towards her. The same smell, from the amortentia still lingered on him, her lips met his slowly caressing each other. They melt into each other forgetting about anything around them, only thought in their mind was the feeling of the other ron and hermione. It started slowly, which built into frenzy, passionate kiss, they were practically devouring each other, trying to quell an unquenchable thirst. They started embracing the other and their hands started caressing each other's back hermione soon snapped his the loin cloth he was wearing, it fell to the floor, she hold on his dick with one hand stroking it and the other caressing his firm ass. He was not hung like a horse or something, he is not long or anything like the tales. He has an good average length and perfect width to get satisfy, like an bit of an sculpture and it is made for her, only for her. It is not big the biggest, longest cock she has ever seen compared to the ones she used, before killing them. But it is special, because it is rons penis, her ron. Ron groaned, from her manhandling, he brought his two fingers and suddenly swiped her slit from down to top and they both gasped. "So wet...... So ready" ron said between kissing. "Yes..... for you, only for you" she whispered back. She herself was surprised to see how fast she become wet for him. It had never happened before this fast, sometimes she used lubricant magic to get her slick. She suddenly let go of him and undressed herself using her wandless magic, crawled on the bed showing her tight round arse and pussy from the backside to sit near the headboard of the bed, ron groaned seeing her naked. She was so perfect, her breasts really developed from her teen years, not big, but surely above average, tight, firm. Perfect curvaceous structure with that kind of ass, oh my god it is really a treat for him actually, this is going to be one time, but he his going to make it a ideal memory for them. She sat against the headboard and beckoned him to crawl towards her, he did and settled on top of her, she laid down beneath him after kissing his whole face lovingly. He looked down at her asking for permission, she nodded. He positioned himself between her and slowly slid into her, they both moaned loudly at the contact. The feeling of ron inside her broke something inside her, that was held back. One she knows is extreme love for him and the other is the lust of her, which she only released once a month, but now it took control of her. Ron's hard erection was slamming in and out of her, making her whimpering, her walls tightly squeezing her. "Oh....mione" the said name from him overwhelming her "you're.....So......tight and hot" that did it. Lust completely overtook her, she wrapped her legs around his waist, pulling him deeper into her, so close and tight, scratching his back with her finger nails, cutting his skin. "Hermione......." he whimpred.  "Shut your bloody trash and just fuck me hard..... or else i will kill her" she said, rons eyes widened. Is she serious, ron thought of stopping his movements to cut their blissful contact, but when he thought of it, she was right, she could do that or else...... my child. Ron doubled his efforts, biting his inner cheeks, to control him from erupting so fast, because she felt so amazing, she pressed her sharp nails on his collarbones arching her hips up, intentionally trying to cut his skin, to make blood come out, also started to bite him on his shoulders. With a sudden jerk, hermione was trembling, she is coming, face flushed and sweat. "Don't stop....go on.....go on" she said. But he didn't because he reached the limit and exploaded deep iniside her, they both layed there and panted. Suddenly hermione had a kinky idea to show her dominance over him "Good fucking ron...... but I didn't remember saying you to cum inside me" said said and he laughed. "Sorry..... i kind of.... gone" "Alright then, clean it" "Uh....I don't have a wand" "Use your tongue" "What" he yelled "you can't be serious, you want me to lick my own cum?" "It is not only yours, it also consists my juices. Now drink or ready to sacrifice your family" "No.no stop, i will do it" "You have to, it's my order" she said and widened her legs. Ron took a deep breadth, of course he gave oral sex, but with his cum inside it, he don't wanted to, but he have to, he slowly lowered his head, until his face was in level with her pussy. There was hesitation in his face, but she doesn't like that, she pushed his face into her pussy by yanking his hair firmly and forced him to lick there and he was licking, tasting their combined flavours with his tongue and cleaning it "Look.at.me. while you do it" she said and ron looked straight into her eyes, she smiled at him and fondly caressed his hair with her fingers and sighed. Suddenly her whole body glowed blue with some sort of symbols, there was a burning sensation in his forearms and he leapt out of his bed screaming. She too came down from the bed, the symbols disappearing from her body, she was suddenly dressed using the magic without wand. She snapped her fingers, the guards who were outside came in and held him steady kneeling on the floor on his kness "You bitch, i believed you...... what did you do to me?" he asked full of rage. "Oh ron, it's not good to call your mistress bad words, is it?" she asked smirking. The burning sensation in his forearms turned into a symbol which almost looked like death eater's dark mark, he remembered seeing it somewhere very recently, she cleared her throat he looked at her and she showed her mark on her forearm, which looked exactly like his. "We completed our bonding ron, you belong to me,me and draco actually, but he will not touch you without my permission dear" she continued "the permenant pet bonding could be done only through sex, because the pet should be willing and it should be proclaim there love for their master" he remembered her act before they have sex. The bond of her and draco done by voldemort was just a declaration of marital privileges, which showed they both had equal rights on the properties and each other as husband and wife, but it can't share feelings. The new bond, which she created with ron is full of promise of love declaration and the feeling they had during intercourse will last whenever they are near other, which means they will always stay hungry for each other. It is a nice way to sate her needs, with him, so she didn't have to use other guys. It can also alert you when the other is in serious danger and can sense what the other is feeling. "Yes ron, i trapped you actually, you must be really an idiot to think, i would let leave you just like that" his looked embarrassed and disappointed "don't worry I have other plans for your wife" he tried to lunge on her with a newly found anger "You won't be going anywhere ron, you will be kneeling infront of me, sometime between my legs, for the rest of your life". There was a snap and feel of cold metal around his neck, he realised it was a collar, he touched it and it disappeared. "Don't worry ron the name they engraved on your chest and the invisible collar is to mark you my pet, permenant pet" she said quietly with a wink. And ron realized he was grinning stupidly. His rage disappiated and a sudden calmness over took it. He felt like himself he is still angry at her, but he felt like he couldn't express it.  The thought of her brought out his deep feelings for her love and lust course through him, she wanted to taste her cunt juices, wanted to thrust his dick into her again and again until he die. His dick stood erected and then she smiled at him, she walked over to him and stroked his dick with her feet three times, kissed his forehead and whispered "Not now pet".
  
    Chapter Text
    Seamus Finnigan was kneeling in the cold hard stone marble, with his hands tide behind his head. Because if he let his hands drop just for a bit of relaxation, the guard who stood in a loin cloth behind him will use the nail whip on his back again, its already flushed with many lines of blood. It was one of the punishment since he taken by the dark witch among the other resistance. Of course some of them escaped, dean thomas was one of them and seamus knows dean will sure come back. It had been really a blow, more than 200 were captured, the muggles and squibs men were killed then and there, by her own hands, she was just flashing death curses among all the men. The houses created were burned in her rage, she didn't even used her wand for any of that, it must be wandless magic, she become so powerful. The womens and children however were another thing entirely. Some were taken as slaves and pets among with men, some were taken as maids along with the children, no one could find about ron and helen. Some thought they were dead, some even suggested that they eloped, sacrifing us, but he knows ron better. He is as stubborn as his teenage self, still fighting for his loved ones. The night after ron went moment's later, there were a sound of big crashing like thunder's roaring but not from the sky, its like near you or something. He heard screaming, cruel laughing, he went out and witnessed all happened, the death eaters are killing them, burning them alive. He and dean fought with some, but they were not enough, they were not prepared for this much, they kept coming. So they ran in different directions, two seperate groups, obviously he had been captured, dean and his team were gracefully escaped. He saw her among the chaos, her eyes were dark with lust, not for sex, lust for revenge, lust for blood, a lust to kill. She was not in her right mind. She even killed death eaters, they are too running away from her, he could feel the dark magic reflecting from her from a good distance. Looking like a women voldemort, but so pretty and sexy, with nose too. He witnessed what that dark bitch did to luna, dean doesn't know, if he did, he would have come back to take revenge on whoever killed his wife. Yes dean and luna were married eventually, but he stayed single, because he knows about his situation, he will be killed one day. Four of them were selected among the hundreds of people to stay in the prisons of her castle. He was one of them, the selected are the main people in the group. It was hell, the last three days since they were caught, there were made nude, they were tortured, by whipping on their backs, pulling nails from their fingers, beatings till they faint no food, water to drink mixed with spits of the nasty guards, forced to have sex with one another, one women and three men show for them. He was handled by the death eaters, all this time. He had not seen any one except the other three resistance people and random death eaters, who wanted to have fun with them, they were raped by them, he was luckily once, but being a women, the one among them was raped by all of them before his eyes. He could not help her, couldn't do anything to save a fellow resistance. Their wands were taken away from them. He knows ron will save them, ron weasley will lead them to victory, the light will rule the darkness again. But he was ready, when the time comes, when the remaining resistance enters, it will be the death of the dark witch.

    Draco was simply wasted, had so much drink, had sex with more than 10 slaves to sedate himself. But he couldn't, he couldn't ignore his feelings for hermione. He couldn't ignore his jealousy towards ron weasley. Fuck, i would have been her pet if she just asked. But no, she just used my money and me as a servant all this time. I should have known, but my eyes are covered with the love for her. It's true, that she had sex with whoever she wants once a month, before killing them, but all the men weren't ronald weasley. He knows she loves him, that's why she would not kill him, even if he is the leader of the resistance. I never felt this miserable when she murdered my aunt, when she made my father writhe in pain and announced as a pet for her parents. Even after all this, i still love her. Love her so much, that I promise myself, I'll find a way to kill the red head without her knowing. "My lord", the castle guard called. "What is it?" draco asked. He came near Draco and whispered in his ears "A spy is hear, with a important news and he wants to meet the empress". "Send him in, I'll talk to him first"  "But, my lord---" draco glared at him. The guard nodded and gone out, after half a minute, the guy with the message came in. Hermione may be the darkest and powerful witch there is, but she liked to be prepared for the worst earlier. So she placed spies in every in every other kingdoms including dark lord himself. "My lord, i came here with me carrying an important warning for the empress" "First tell me where it is from and the the news, I'll approve if you want to meet her" "The kingdom o...of dark..... lord.... my lord" he said, Draco's eyes widened.  "Two days before me with a guard on the ground inspection found an anonymous library with the collection of astrology seeking things and we caught a prophecy, looks likes the same before the war" "What- he gulped- What did it said?"  "Before a decade ends, the one who lived among the two, will be dead by the dark witch" he said "Is that it?" draco asked. The man nodded. "Yes, my lord, there were so many glass balls, everything where saying the same things. I didn't know, what to do so i killed the other guard, hide his body there and escaped here to tell the news, the owl post will be checked there, so I couldn't owl the information. And im sure they will search for the guard, if they found the library......" "No they will not, do we have some of our guys there, don't we?" the man nodded. "Good, I'm going to make him leave his kingdom for a bit a distraction, its the right time to destroy the evidence, no one knows about this until the whole mission is complete, not even my wife" draco said. "Do you mean the empress sir?" the guard asked stupidity. "YES, I SAID MY WIFE DIDN'T I? She maybe your empress, but before that she is MY WIFE!!" he shouted. The guard coward under his raising voice "Sorry, sir it's my fault" and ran out. Draco hadn't not simply said about the distraction, he had a plan already. A plan that will get two things done at once. The dark lord is interested, in more than one ways with his wife, he wouldn't let her get into love with anyone, he insults draco everytime he makes a visit. He already hated ron because he was a blood traitor, he also knows hermiones love interest for him, now he's back, the dark lord will definitely wanted him dead, that's for sure. So at the same time, draco could get ron out of his way, save his wife become her hero. His plan was ready, he could keep it as a surprise for her. Surely she will not get mad, her life is more worth to her than her pet's. Draco walked out of the castle, ready to visit the dark lord unofficially,smiling to himself as he made the most stupid plan in his life out of booze of the alcohol and love for his wife.

    They were walking down the corridor, with him behind her every where she went, holding the chain of his collar that was locked around his neck. He was walking on all fours, with his knees and hands pressed to the cold floor, following her nude, exactly since he had become her official pet, like a dog in heat. His cock rock hard, oozing out precome all the way, smelling her sex, lusting after her sex, wanting to taste her juices, wanting to touch her body, to feel her heat around him. It was not easy, as it had been two days, he was made as her pet, but didnt even allowed to wank, she would make him lie on her bed, with her cuddled tightly around him, despite his overgrowing lust for her, he should not touch her, thats was the order, but he did once so he was made to kneel beside her bed on the floor all night, his knees are red from the blood non pulsing there from yesterday. He knows she is doing it intentionally, to make him go mad. Despite her own control of lust for him. They both could feel it in the others. But he don't know why is she doing this to him and herself. Just as he was thinking about it, a large oak door, which looked so expensive was opened. She walked in, him following behind her. When he saw, what is inside the room, his eyes went large and looked down ashamed.  Four of the main members of the resistance were standing on their knees, hands tied behind wearing nothing but a loin cloth, they all looked so wounded and exhausted, especially the women, who seemed so like tortured. He couldn't meet their gazes, what will they think, seeing their leader, crawling on the floor behind their enemy, like a sex hungry pet slave. He felt so humiliated. She left him stand in the same position, on all the fours and seated in her throne. She smirked at him and the others. "So this is your resistance group huh? Ron? Is this your plan, with all of you kneeling before me, begging me to have mercy on all of you?". The ten guards in the room laughed maniacally at them.Ron felt defeated, he let down his people, he lose to save the people believed in him to stop her and he knows she is now enjoying the thoughts generating form his head. "Actually thinking about it, it would have been done a lots of good for you and your 'peoples', i would have considered to let you all have some freedom ron, if you could have just man up and confess your love for me, begged me to take you back, but you thought you could defeat me". "I seriously doubt, that you are the one, i studied with for six years in hogwarts, you are seriously an idiot ron, how could you think, that I would be defeated, don't you remember me blowing you to land on your arse at the DA dark arts lesson?" still ron will not take his eyes of the ground, he couldn't. Hermione noticed, the other members of the resistance were looking at him "Still do you seriously think he could save you?" she laughed. "Let me tell you one think, he is my pet now, i can sense him, what he wants and what he is thinking and I'm going to tell you what it is". Ron's eyes got widened, he is scared, she wouldn't do that, no she will not. "He feels humiliated, defeated but more than that even at this moment he feels lust for me, he will practically beg me to ride him.......do you guys want to see?" They four looked at each other, with confused looks, he knows what they were thinking, their leader was a stubborn guy, wouldn't follow her orders. But he will he know. She stood, lifted her silk dress with a slit, upto her waist, now she was naked below her waist, there was a clean shaved pussy. The musky smell was making him go mad, he wanted to lick it, savour her taste, want her juices flowing all over his body, he felt like an animal looking at its prey. The sight of her made him so horny, so hungry with lust. Apparently the others in the room felt so maybe, as they all got sudden rock hard erections. She sat down on her throne, in front of him, widening her legs, exposing herself to the world. Showing her shrine glistening, dripping with juices. So he guessed right, they both have same feelings all this time. She patted her pussy "Come on pet here is your feast, feed on it", his urge to lap at her was extreme, but he was having none of it, he is resisting her. He was practically shaking with lust for her, also he could feel her anger rising because of his disobedience "Don't you want to eat my pussy?" "Come on pet, eat my pussy. Eat my pussy as if it were your favourite meal in the whole world" she inserted two fingers inside her and he lost it, he lunged forward stretching her legs wide, by keeping his hands on her thighs, he opened his mouth wide and covered her sex with it, literally snogging her pussy, the wet slurping sounds echoing all around the four walls. "Oh gods" she moaned, her legs spasming on the sides, he shoved his tongue deep inside her lapping at her nectar sucking her juices, his long nose pressed against her clit "That's it, be a good boy and make your mistress cum". She moaned wantonly and it made every cock in the room gave a twitch "Oh, i swear ron, im going to....ah..... I'm... I'm going to make you eat my pussy every morning for your breakfast" both of their minds covered in the haze of lust for each other, forgetting everyone around them. Ron couldn't get enough, he wanted to go more into her, just wanted to stay between her legs forever. "Eat me, EAT ME RON!!!" she demanded. "Fuck 'ermione" he groaned, licking from her ass to her clit, making round and round on her clit. “Aah....such a good, pussy-eating pet" she laughed. "Yes Ron!! Yes, just like that, keep going.... ah..It feels soooo good" she said between a whimper and a moan. “suck on my clit now” she said her pussy throbbing. “Aaahh, yes, yes! Gods.... It's.....Oooh......Rooooon! I’m so clo — aaaah, aaaaah!” she screamed shaking her whole body in her throne, her face flushed red with clear bliss. Ron took a step back, his cock near to expload, his face covered with her juices. He looked up at her, she slowly opened her eyes and looked at him. "Did i tell you to stop?" she asked angrily, he shook his head. "I want to cum again, make me cum again ron.... be a good pet and just do that" she ordered and yanked him by his hair towards her pussy,  Ron looked up her eyes dark with lust, her bossy side is clearly making its way up and it's making him go mad with love and lust he thought. love? what the fuck. Still holding him by his hair, she moved her pussy all over his face, moaning in pleasure, her juices spreading over all his face, it smells so good, taste so good.  "AH......YES, yes, just like that,” she moaned. “You love me smothering yor face with my juicy pussy, pet?” she asked grinning "Do you want more juices?". Ron nodded his cock twitching painfully, hoping he will get to fuck her today atleast. He began to suck her clit very hard. Her eyes rolled backwards and Ron felt a wave of jealousy towards her. She is cuming hard, twice now. But he didn't for the last two days. He is sure his sack is full, loads of cum now. She started squirming, when he shoved his tongue into her to get more of her cum. She locked him between her by using her thighs over his shoulders and crossing her ankles on the back of his head. “Go back to my clit,” she ordered, yanking on his hair to move his mouth to where she needed it. “I’m so close pet......Ah....... you better make me cum hard.” She was practically fucking his face and he could imagine how much she was enjoying doing this sexual act there, no care to the atmosphere around them surrounded by all her guards and the prisoners. She really has no shame. “Mmmmh, pet.......so good, so good … Aah.... put your finger in there......now” she demanded, her entire body vibrating as she rubbed her pussy against his face. “Ahhh.... don't stop, never stop....ah" he wants to cum so badly now, the prim proper old version of hermione acting like a wanton slut “Do you like........ah.....sucking my pussy pet? Are you grateful to me for giving my pussy for you to eat?” When he didn't answer, she grabbed his hair and made him look up "I asked are you grateful, say it, Say it!!" Ron doesn't even realise his team members are there, because if he did, he wouldn't be answered loudly "Yes!! Yes, please let me eat your pussy, im so grateful" she smirked and let him go, he continued sucking her. Eager to taste her cum once more, he inserted two fingers and suddenly she burst out, her cum hitting all over his face, she came crying out loudly. Ron stood from between her legs and tried to crawl over her to insert his dick into her, but she pushed him away, but he tried again and again. She was laughing at him as the guards at his activity, he was crying and begging to her for some release, to feel inside her.
"Look at your leader, crying like a child, begging me to ride him" she said still laughing. Ron couldn't stop, he was feeling ashamed but his mind was filled with lust, he wanted a release, he wants to fuck her. She snapped her fingers and two guards grabbed him by his elbow and made him stay back from her. She stood and walked over to the exit "I will give you four time until tomorrow,  to decide on your options, join me or get yourself killed" she left, the guards dragged ron behind her, all the time he was facing the floor, tears dropping to the ground, not wanting to feel their disgusted looks on him.

    He is standing in the corner of the room, legs weak and unbalanced from the sensation to touch his own dick, but couldnt. She wouldn't let him, after he made oral sex to her in front of nearly 20 people, she walked in furiously inside her room. The guards pushed him into the room and shut the doors, she cast a silencing charm all over the room. He don't know what to do, so he was standing in the corner watching her, pacing across her own room furiously. "Stand on the bedside, half in bed, half showing your arse up in the air" she ordered and he did it, not even an ounce of protest. She came and stood behind him, he waited in anticipation "You want a release, don't you ron?" he asked teasingly. "Yes....please" he begged and she laughed. "Sorry my dear pet, but you are not going to get it" he whimpered and tried to touch his own shaft. But she made him stand firmly in the kneeling position, binding his hands and legs wandless. "No touching......pet, your shaft is mine now, just like your body..... you could have got a release, but you weren't a good boy today, you should learn the manners of pet to their masters and mistress, you should not hesitate when they order something.... but you did hesitated tried to resist me" "You have been a bad boy today..... if we were at hogwarts, i would have given you some book to read, but now I have to teach you some manners....... in a method which can teach you quickly......." She leaned toward his ears and whispered the last part "with some punishment". She said some spell in latin, then suddenly he gasped. He could feel a strong sensation of something tightening around the base of his cock and a hold so firm on his ball sac. He looked down, but there was nothing there "Don't worry, it's an invisible cock cage ron, draco has one just like this.... by putting this on you can't even wank, if you tried touching it, the pain of not getting release will increase. So if you want to touch it, then go on.... touch it" "Hermione..... i mean mistress, please..... Please, i beg you, we were best friends, I'm not asking for freedom, but atleast give me release from this torture, please let....me.....come". "I will, if you will be a good boy, you have to go through with this punishment, until you learn to obey your mistress, pet....... Oh and don't think the punishment is over, you have one more surprise" she said and walked over to the wood cupboard, saying some spells she transfigured something and came to stand behind him. When he saw, what she was holding his heart starts to beat faster, eyes went wide as saucers "No.... no, hermione please.... no..... Please don't do this, it's already paining there"  "I know ron, but your ass looks so inviting and you should learn to take the punishments happily from your mistress" She really couldn't help but admire his arse, so plump and fleshy, she started fondling them. His balls and dick dangling, she parted his cheeks and looks at his hole winking at her, she smiled fondly, maybe later..... now you have your punishment. She let go of his cheeks and he was waiting for it, suddenly there was a blow to his arse, she was whipping him with the leather whip she took from. It sting so much, he can't even bring his hands back to rub his ass. His pale arse suddenly turned so red and she loved it, but she wants to break his stubbornness so "Count it, count every whip, maybe i will stop somewhere or else i will go on and on, till you have no arse". "Ye...... yes mistress" he said scared of her. "Lets start from the beginning then......" (Blow) "One" he screamed and she laughed. Two....Three....... She started whipping him as hard as she could liking the way it bounced fifteen....... the way it shades turning redder and redder.......Thirty two and finally she stopped at forty. Hermione was watching his ass in awe, liking the way it seems so red like his hair, the way he screamed, writhing in pain, his whimpers, his moans. Ron was crying, his tears drenched the bedspreads, his anger was replaced with fearness, his cock still hard, aching at his balls. She released him and he silently, rolled on to the bed to lay on his stomach, because the other way is not possible as his ass was destroyed. "Good boy........now im going somewhere, I'll come back soon. Don't worry, alright?" She kissed the back of his head and left the room, locking it, leaving a crying ron to lay on the bed.~~~~~~~~~~~Hermione reached her parents house at australia, she didn't needed any special permissions as she is the ruler of that land too. She entered into her parents house wearing a normal robes non-revealing, complete opposite to the one she wears except in front of her parents. As soon as she entered the house, she nearly laughed looking at the scene before her. Her father was watching tv, lucius kneeling before him as a footrest looking down expressionless, her father has his legs rest on his back. "Hi dad" she called he turned around and looked at her. "Hermione sweetheart" he stood and walked over to her, hugged her "when did you reach her, why a surprise visit?" "I just kind of wanted to see you two, where is mum?" "Oh she is in the kitchen, trying new dishes" "What? Why? That's why lucius is here, is he not obeying your orders?" she asked looking at him angrily, lucius cowered under her intense gaze. "No... no that's not it, sweety. She said she wants to make food herself, feel alive once more or something. Let me tell you the truth, i perfectly like the life you gave us, expensive house, a pet to do anything we ask..... but your mum...... she doesn't quite actually like her new life" "She even treating him as a friend or something" he said pointing at his pet still kneeling on the floor. "Ok.... let me talk to her, do you mind if i borrow your pet for a bit?" "Not at all". She snapped her fingers at him and walked into the kitchen, lucius at her heels. Her mum was baking something at the stove "Hi dear, when did you get here?" she asked at hermione, who was just sitting in the kitchen table. She snapped her fingers at lucius and pointed it to her feet, suddenly lucius crawled under the table, like understanding something, sat down, took her feet in his hands and started sucking her toes. Instantly she got wetter, she remembered the time he raped her, it was against her will but he was good then his son, the nest part of it was him sucking her toes, it gave an amazing pleasure to her everytime he suck her toes. Stifling back a moan, she started talking to her mum. "Dad told something... About you don't quite like the new life, what is it mum, is there any problems?" Her mum sighed and turned around keeping her hands still on the kitchen counter "Let me ask you something dear..... are you happy..... what do you get by this, i mean you have money, you rule more than half of the world now, but..... what do you get from this, there is nothing you can take, when you die.....I know you don't like draco, but you have to start a family with him, get children......not taking care of the people" Her mum doesn't know, she is a mass human trafficking dealer, but she was right about her rule on the half of the world. Lucius sucking slightly faltered when her mum mentioned family with Draco, so she shoved her toes deep into his mouth, to suck hard. "Mum, if you asked me, this question before a week, i would have said no..... but now im so happy, the important reason I'm here today is to tell you that" Her mum looked surprised and walked fast forward to sit in the chair across from her, lucius took her toes in his other hand and started sucking both their toes at the same time, both trying hard to control the moan, urging to escape their mouth. "I got ron back, mum" "Ronald weasley? Your best friend? Molly's son? she asked with tears in her eyes. "Yes, mum, he is back and he said he still loves me" "But.... how.... how did he escaped?" Hermione started telling some fake stories to her mum, like everytime to make her believe she is not turned into evil. "Oh my good......it had been five years and he still waited for you, without finding any girl? Without a family?" her mum asked. "No mum..... he waited for me.....Only. me" she said trying not to grit her teeth. "Well, then it's your wish..... but don't compel me to live like your father, i will adjust to this, when i feel like im ready" "It already had been five years and you still not got adjusted" hermione laughed. They talked and spent some bonding time between parent and child for nearly two hours before she left from there.

    "My lord, Mr. Draco malfoy is here to meet you" tumas said to voldemort. Tumas is the most trusted servant of him, simply act as an minister of him. "Send him in tumas" he said in his silky voice, tumas nodded and left. Moments later draco walked in the living room where dark lord usually rest in his palace and got his eyes wide, by the surprise view. Before him was sitting tom riddle, voldemorts original body of the handsome boy, once studied in hogwarts. Draco bowed "Ah draco, come in, please have a seat". Draco nodded and sat in the arm chair before him. "So, what is it, you wanted to meet me, is your wife finally realised you are worthless and couldnt satisy her, so she thrown you out of her castle?" he asked laughing, the guards in the room laughing too. Draco resisted the rise of anger "No. My lord....she did not throw me out, but she is definitely getting satisfied by her new permanent pet". Riddle leaned forward "I dont understand draco, is there anyone i would have to kill?" "Ronald weasley, my lord. The blood traitor ronald weasley, her love, he is back as her new pet.... Permanent actually". Riddle pointed his wand towards draco "why am i hearing this now? She got ronald weasley as her permanent pet? I thought he is dead" he seethed. Draco held his hands in defence "I don't know my lord, i thought she was going to kill him, but she made him permanent pet.... for life long, that's why I'm here, to pass the message to you, as your loyal servant" he gulped. "I will not let anyone to have her for themselves, the only reason you are alive as her husband, because you are, but just for the name sake, i know she doesn't want you" that hurt draco so..... so much. "But ron weasley is not like that, how is here in the first place...... how is he not dead?" "Some guys saved him, five years ago, they formed a group of resistance against hermione.....and eventually to get you, but they lost against her, she have him as her own" "Hmmm.... then she has a nerve to hide it against me, she knows she belongs to me, i will kill him now, before her eyes"  "Yes, my lord, you should now..... or she might hide him elsewhere" Riddle stood and walked over to the fireplace "You are good servant draco, just like your father, even give your wife to me if i asked" he laughed with others, Draco's eyes watered with the humiliation. For hermione he'll can take some humiliation he thought. Riddle disappeared suddenly and draco turned on his heels walking out of the palace to the guards waiting outside, he joined the group of his spies "Does all my men who knows about the prophecy is here right?" he asked and they all nodded and they sped to the library.On the way he thought how it is even possible, if the one who lived will be killed by the darkest witch there is, then when aunt bella lived the fate of harry potter was decided? So now riddle will be killed by hermione? because probably she is the darkest witch now. They started destroying the place with their wands, when the place was completely destroyed he stupified his own men all at once. Not wanting to leave any evidence, he killed all of them and set fire all over, so no one knows about the prophecy except him.

    He was awakened by the sound of doors opening, he didn't even know when he slept, maybe exhausted from all the crying. He looked up and saw a feminine figure entering silently through the slightly parted door. At first, he thought it was hermione, but after looking clearly it was susan bones. She came near to him, where he was still sleeping on his stomach. She laid her hands on his reddened ass cheeks and slowly rubbed small circles on it. He jumped softly and she stood back surprised. "I'm sorry" she said coming near him again and fondling her fingers through his scalp. "It's not your fault, I'm a pet now, so don't worry" he said back and suddenly realising he asked "Is it bath time or something... is that why are you here? Is it already the next morning?" he asked trying to get up. Daily morning and night, he was usually bathed by the maids and susan is one of them. "No.... the guards are lazy, all of them are nowadays more interested in the break room...i don't know why" she talked more to herself "I'll tell you why I'm here now......But first, don't talk loud and second, just listen to me without interrupting" He nodded quickly. "I found where is your wife is, she wasn't sold as pet or maid, she is here......in the castle" he tried to interrupt, but she held her hand to stop him "But I don't know where....I promise I will find her though, just give me some time" He nodded again sadly. "And second, when I went to give food to the prisoners, your friend seamus...... he wanted me to tell you something, that is...." she thought a second before continuing "the fox still lives in our forest, but....we want a bridge........to invite it to us.... yeah, something like that". "Thank you, susan. I'll take care of that..... just please try to find my wife....I just atleast wanted to know how she is with my baby and all" "Yeah..... sure, don't worry. Nothing is going to happen to her......I have to go, before someone notices". They both nodded and she glanced at him nervously before leaning forward and kissing his lips, it was not hungry kiss like hermione's. It consist of a tenderness. His cock still rock hard in the cock cage stirred painfully. He thought of asking help from her or to fuck her here, so he can get some release. She broke the kiss, her cheeks heavily flushed red, she nodded and walked quickly out of the door. Ron eyed the door and thought about the code word of seamus. The fox is dean, so some of the resistance should've escaped, he wanted a plan to connect them..... the bridge. But he have to be fast, because tomorrow they have to make a decision to join her or will be dead.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~She happily flooed in her castle fireplace, after spending some time with her parents. But suddenly got surprised by seeing tom riddle smiling sweetly at her, drinking tea and sitting in the big couch across the fireplace in the living room, surrounded by her guards and maids. Why is he here? Without even informing? Oh my god, she have to hide ron. Suddenly her head guard came near her and whispered in her ear "He got hear before an hour, he said he wanted to search the castle, but I didn't.....I said you'll get angry, so he said he'll wait till you come". She nodded and walked over to sit in the arm chair before him. "My lord, what a surprise.... can i know what is the purpose of your visit?" "I'm sure your head guard would have told you that, so now im thinking you should stop playing these stupid games with me". "I'm sorry, my lord.....But.....I don't understand" "The blood traitor, where is he?"  So he is here for ronald, but how does he know "Blood traitor......Who?" Riddle sighed "You know if I wished i could've killed all your men and burn your castle to ashes till I find him.... but I didn't, because i trust you hermione.... stop hiding him and hand him over to me". "I'm sorry, my lord..... Somebody have gave you a wrong information.... there is no blood traitor in my castle, that I've hide" He suddenly stood angrily thrown his cup to the floor and came near her side, closer to her left ear and whispered "I'm the dark lord, you mudblood, i gave you all this.... you are now what you are..... only because of me.... Understand?". "I could have made you my pet or a personal sex slave to enjoy, but I didn't i valued your brain, i gave you everything you asked.... now give him to me.....". "Hermione stood too and said firmly "i don't have any doubt, you are the one to give all these to me and you have to maintain some decency..... if I didn't give you any permission to check 'MY' castle..... then that's what it means....'MY' castle". she said pointing a finger at herself. He slapped her hard in front of everyone, and held her tight by holding her wrists firmly "You mudblood whore..... how dare you talk to me like that..... I'm your master.... Your lord....remember? You can't hide him always from me.....I can take him easily" he looked at her and saw she was looking all around them, he too looked all around them. Every one of her guards were pointing there wands at him, ready to blow out unforgivable curses. He released his hold on her wrists and laughed "Really?.....You know I could kill you all.... here.....now right?" That's right she thought. She made a wave with her hand to make them down their wands "My lord..... what I'm saying is true, i have no blood traitor here.....I don't even know who you are talking about". "Never mind.....I have a new idea in my mind......I don't want any blood traitor anymore.... but next week....you will be bonded to me, as my queen....A mudblood queen, an official marriage..... Don't worry I'm not going to treat you as pet..... because you are special" he said coming near her, their mouth inches away from each other, she gulped in fear. She could feel the darkness inside him, the dark magic an evil power, she suddenly felt so envious of him and a plan arised in her head. But she kept her mouth shut for now. "Enjoy your last week as an empress of your own kingdom, because after that you will be spending you're rest of your life in my palace.......as my queen, getting fucked by me" he said and leaned down to kiss her neck near her pulse, she shivered. He backed away some and she felt relieved "Be ready...... next week" he said and walked over to the fireplace(as she used the same magic that was in hogwarts, so no one could disapparate in and out) to get to his own palace.  After he left, she felt humiliated, anger bubbled inside her...... Bonding to him? As if.......how dare he? Coming in to my castle.... he beat me in front of my guards and maids. She also felt envious, the power she felt when he neared her making her greedy, she wanted that power..... it is true he is stronger than her, there will be something to defeat him, to make her achieve her goal. To kill him..... but how does he came to know about ron? Does somebody who hate him or me, would have told him? But the guards and maids can't leave the castle without her permission....Then.... how....Oh.....Him..... he wouldn't !!.. would he? "Where is draco?" she asked her guard. "He went out of the castle today morning.... he didn't inform us where he was going nor took any guards with him, he went alone from here" She nodded "Ask him to meet me, when he arrives" she said and walked away, fuming.

    From the moment he entered the castle, the guards were eyeing him up and down. He felt self conscious actually, some were even sniggering too, he thought of warning them. But what if they decided to beat him, he is really rubbish at duelling. When he entered the main corridor, that led to his room among the other vacant guest rooms. His head guard wearing the loin cloth came towards him. "Draco" he called, how dare he!!! "What?..... what did you just call me? You dare utter your master's name without respect?" he asked angrily. The guards came close to him and whispered "Yes, i know..... but after today I don't think you will be my master anymore" he said and stood behind. Draco eyed him suspiciously. "Master...... the empress wanted to spend the night with you" he said and walked away. Wow, draco thought..... he just came back from the mission of saving her and she already want him. He is going to tell the whole story and make her his own, only his. Draco excitedly walked into hermione's room. When he entered, he saw hermione was sitting in the bedside, her legs hanging down, her eyes closed, her face wearing an expression of pleasure. Ron weasley was sucking her toes eagerly, like a child sucking on a candy. "Where were you draco?" she asked him breaking him of his thoughts. He looked up and saw her smiling sweetly at him. Ron still continuing his actions. "Why is he here" draco asked her back, pointing his hands towards her pet. She sighed "If you don't mind draco, I'm the one asked who would ask questions.... not the other way around". "Oh....ok....
You wanted to know where i was?.....I was at voldemorts kingdom saving your life!!" Ron started listening silently to work out his plan of the resistance escape. She laughed "Atleast a part of that was true". "What?..... are you serious? I just saved you from voldemort and this is how you thank me?" "Thank you?.......... Thank you for what actually........ Having riddle barge into my castle without announcement, to search for ron and kill him, for slapping me in front of my guards and maids or for me going to be bonded with him as his queen within next week? Which one....Huh?" she asked. Draco stood startled hanging his mouth open "Bonding with him? How could he? You are my wife" "I'm not anyone's...... how dare you inform about ron to riddle, just to get rid of him" "Listen..... yes I did, but there is a big thing behind this" "Explain" So draco started telling the whole story of him meeting riddle till burning the prophecy and about the prophecy, hermione listened silently, ron still on floor sucking her toes, listening subtly too. "Oh.... so that it is....... then there is no way he'll beat me, so he will be dead in a fight with me.... if that's the prophecy is" then she should start working her plan, she thought. "It's good what you did Draco....... but as per the prophecy, there is no way he'll kill me, it's the other way around". "Anyway, i should still punish you, for making a mission without discussion and making my Pet's life fall in danger". Draco stared at her bewildered......."You want to punish me, for what I have done..... for saving you..... he is just a pet, I'm your husband, is he more valuable than me?" he asked heartbroken. "You know the answer yourself draco" she said and slowly rubbed rons head, he groaned delightfully around her toes. "But don't worry, still you done something useful since you born, so....when you entered, i thought to kill you, but now, I'm taking your official postings from this moment on you are nothing but a slave in this castle, for entertaining my guards" his heart broken, tears pooled in his eyes. "That's it? Am I atleast your husband still?" "No, you're not" she said quickly. "And im undoing this bond here and now, also I announce you to be my slave, no rights to your properties or freedom, if you think against the decision of your empress, then you can rot in prison" she ordered pointing to her bond mark on her forehand. "But.....I love you" he said his voice shallow and crooked heavy with sadness, a lone tear sliding down his cheeks. At the same time ron thought 'The Bridge' "I'm not responsible for your pathetic feelings draco, just because I was bonded to you, doesn't mean i want you....I accepted the bondage, because i wanted to live". "Now as per your first order, I'm going to give some trainings as a slave..... It will be new too you, as you were rolling in money, but now just like your father....... you are a malfoy slave...... for your first command, remove your clothing and bend over that table" she said and pointed to a coffee table near them. He slowly removed his dress, one by one shakily. He was miserable, his life was a lie, his love was a lie, everything he done upto this point, didn't mean anything. He slide down his boxers slowly between his thighs, it reached his ankles, he thrown it away shaking his legs. Hermione and ron, both were watching him, their gaze intense, rons cock turned purple, his balls looked nearly ready to explode. Oh god it looks so good, he blushed at that filthy thought. He shook his head to clear his thoughts and as per her instruction, he went over to the table and bent down showing his back side. Hermione looked at the erotic scene, she liked this, she turned to ron and pulled his chain upward, ron stood and faced her "Now pet, you wanted some release right?" he nodded fervently, she touched his dick and he gasped from the sensation of her soft hands and the sudden absence of the cage around his dick and balls. "Now go over and fuck him" she ordered and ron stood hesistant. "If you want to find release today, then it is your only way and beside i don't think you forgot today's punishment either" she said and ron suddenly on his way to draco. He stood behind draco, their nude bodies rarely touching each other, he laid his hands on Draco's shoulders and slowly moved towards him. His cock rubbing at the bump of his ass. He bent draco more over the table, until his torso was resting on the table. Draco waited in anticipation, ron parted his cheeks and spit some into his own hands, with saliva as lubricant, he started rubbing it at his opening. Draco gasped and groaned from the sudden sensation, he unknowingly thrusted his hips backwards into Ron's hands. Ron slowly entered two fingers into draco, scissoring it, making it way deep into him, draco moaned. Ron's eyes widened and he slowly experimentally added another finger. After making sure it is well lubricated and hearing dracos moans,  ron couldn't take it anymore. He wanted a hole to fuck, doesn't care about anything else he shoved his dick straight into dracos anus, draco first screamed at the pain and groaned when the pain changed into pleasure.  Ron was not having mercy for Draco's anal hole, into having a release. He was thrusting wildly into draco. Ron was enjoying the moans of draco and the pleasure he was getting from the tight heat around him, then there was another moan. They both looked back over their shoulders panting hard, hermione was sitting in the arm chair having two fingers shoved deep into her pussy fingering her and another hand groping her own boobs. Her eyes black, clearly Wanting more. When the stopped, hermione opened her eyes to see the cause of the silence. They were both looking at her, eyes wide. "Did i tell you to stop pet" she asked biting her teeth. Ron realizing the meaning turned around and started fucking draco again. Suddenly there was a cold sensation in his own anal, he gasped and looked down back over his shoulders. Hermione was kneeled behind him, her face deep into the crack of his ass, she was spreading his cheeks as wide as possible, licking and painting his winking hole outside and inside deep with her tongue. His eyes rolled back to his skull, in pleasure. He was moving his hips forward into draco and backward to the waiting tongue of hermione. She now making rounding movements inside him with her tongue. Suddenly she stopped and walked over to the same wooden cupboard from where she took the leather whip earlier today morning for his punishment. Ron turned around impatient for finally having his release, he again started thrusting into a moaning draco. Then her hands on his hips stilled his movements, she made his bend so he was on top of draco, both bent over the table, then something so big, so long and hard entered his hole, it made him writhe both in pain and pleasure from the prostrate at the same time. After, when the thing entered him, hermione yanked him behind by gripping his hair, he rested his head on her left shoulder. "Do you wanna know, what is inside your ass now?" he nodded "My dick, a dildo, so long and thick than your dick, now streching your ass...." she said huskily, She was wearing a strapon attached with a big black dildo, her ass stood up by the belt of the strain and she started fucking him hard, so that he was pushed deep into Draco.  Now she is the one controlling their movements, she was fucking them hard, wildly with more hunger in her eyes, she started nibbling rons ears. "I like your fat ass gripping my cock ron, when im finished with your ass, I'm sure you cant even walk from then on" she said and spanked his ass, making a wild smile take over his face from the pleasure of both sides. Draco moaned loudly, making them remember of his presence there. "Draco you want more Draco?" hermione asked and he nodded. "Do you want us to fuck you faster, harder...... deeper?" He groaned. "Say it Draco, say what you want !!" "Please fuck me!! Fuck me hard, i want more!!!" draco cried. "Do you both want to cum? Do you both want your mistress to fuck you in your arses? Do you both like getting pegged by me?" "Yes....". "Yessssss mistress" they both moaned in unison. "What a pair of wanton sluts". They both groaned. She started moving faster, thrusting into ron holding her breadth, her movement's made ron to go deeper into Draco. Draco's cock was thrusting against the table and between his own body until now, so soon he was cumming, his seamen spread on the table. Hermione was the second, soon she was shaking and held tight to rons back, to make sure she don't fall from the thunder of a orgasm. Ron was also so close, he was sensing it..... but apparently his mistress can sense it too, because when he was near the edge, she whispered some latin spell, which was muffled in her ears, due to the pleasure he was experiencing made his dizzy. He suddenly gasped when the cage once more tightened around the base of the cock and his balls. He stilled, because if he moves, it will pain him from the sensation of not able to cum. Still laying backwards onto her shoulders he started begging to her "Please, please let me cum....I neeeeed to....to.....cummmmmm....pleaseeeeee" he moaned. She kissed his temple and whispered "I told you, your cock is mine now.....I will decide when you have to cum and you are not going to cum...... today" she used her wandless magic to get dressed and levitated a sleeping draco and a crying ron to the bed. "Sleep tight pet..... tell draco, tomorrow he have a great job of pleasing all the guards in my castle". She left her room, locking it on her way and headed straight to her own personal big guarded library, which is expensive and held a collection of all the books of magic and non magic in the world.

    He heard a sniffing, turned around and saw ronald weasley looking up at the ceiling, cock still rock hard facing upwards too like him. Is he dreaming, sleeping in the same bed? Beside a weasley........ It had been four hours since they had sex, means it was now two or three hours after midnight. He don't know, where hermione went, if she is not sleeping, then she must be definitely in her library, because her second most favourite place in this castle is her library next to her throne. "I need to talk" ron said. "Do you do that often weasley?" draco asked, ron looked confused. "Talking to yourself..... do you do that often" draco said smiling lightly. "Good joke malfoy, but this is no time for sarcasm for us" ron said sternly. "Ok..... what do you wanna talk?" "A gentleman agreement between us against your wif..... oh sorry ex-wife" "Absolutely not.... she maybe not my wife, but I love that women. I will never stand against her" "Ok then...... tell me this malfoy...... do you wanna get fucked by more than 100 guards with gaint cocks, for 25 hours? Because I don't think, one day can cover up all of them...... They'll have to loan up an hour from the next day to shag you". "What" draco askes bewildered "why would I do that?" "Because that's what you will do exactly, if you don't stand with me now..... That's your mistress command for you". Draco thought for a minute "Ok lets talk what is it". "A gentleman deal, simple..... but promise me you'll do it..... I'm not going to kill her, alright if this deal gets done alright, then you can have her, your family properties, but the land will belong to us". Draco nodded. "Oh I never thought I'll make a deal lying nude with another sod" ron muttered rubbed his face and sighed. "You will go out of here, escape the prisoners.....of the resistance group and led them where they wanna go.... also stay with them and do whatever they ask you to do". Draco laughed "Are you mad weasel? They'll catch them within an hour, she'll kill me this time to make them escape". "Don't worry, there are other resistance still outside, they will keep you safe. You just have to stay with them". Draco eyed him "How do you know that?" Ron smiled "Believe me, there are many things we know.... Before you actually". He nodded "Alright, but why aren't you coming?" "She is bonded to me, she'll find me first, if I escaped. Besides i have a important one to find inside this castle"  "Alright, see you on the other side" he held his hand out and ron shook it. "If we make this one alive, don't ever tell anyone, i shook your hands.... Please" draco said. "Oi, sod off" Draco dressed and luckily his wand is still inside his robes, he opened the door using his wand, he turned once again to see ron, they both nodded their heads again and he silently closed the door on his way out.

    There was sudden flash, in the entrance of the prison and the three guards fell down unconscious. He walked through the corridor, that led to the cell, they are in among the other innocent prisoners. He reached and looked through the bars..... there was one guy sobbing at a corner, seamus looking up at the ceiling with a expression of something like determination and another guy was near him sleeping and there was nasty odour inside. He unlocked the door and went in, suddenly the guy who was sobbing moments before lunged at him to attack, but he defended himself with protego. "Hey seamus..... tell your guy to cool down, I'm here to take you guys out" Seamus nodded at the guy and he went to the same place where he had been crying. "Take us out.... You mean an escape....... Why?" "Because i made a deal with the weasel..... Don't ask any other questions. We don't have much time, so if you wanna escape, come with me"  They stood and started following him, but they were nude..... draco uttered some spell, suddenly they were dressed. "What is that nasty smell here?...... where is the fourth one, the women?" he asked. Draco pointed to the other corner, there he saw the women nude body, bruised and was lying lifeless, she is dead. "What happened?"  "Your guards couldn't keep their hands to themselves, she died in mid rape...... even then they didn't stop". he said angrily. The other guy started crying again, who was getting consoled by the third. Draco looked at the body with disgust. They made their way silently out of the corridor and got back to the entrance. "We can't use main doors, there is a secret passage, that's our way to escape" they nodded. Draco gone near the prison door and started rubbing smoothly at the ground, they were looking at him in confusion. Suddenly he took a part of rectangular shaped cold marble out "This is it, no one knows this way except me and my father..... but we have to be quick, they will find out you are missing within minutes" He told them to get in first and walk down a stairs, just before following them, he thought of the women's body and cursed one of the unconscious guard a death spell, seamus saw this and got surprised. It was a sort of underground tunnel, draco was walking in front with his wand casting lumos, with the others following behind. They were near the exit, that's when suddenly the alarm of the castle started ringing loudly.  They started running towards, the exit and luckily got out, ran through the nearest woods and sat low panting behind a big broken tree, that was lying on the ground. "Where do....(pant).... you..... guys wanna go...... we can apparate if i know the place" draco said. "There is no....(pant)....ne....need.... for that" seamus replied and made a bird sound or something, that echoed through the darkness of the forest, which was shinning only with moonlight. Then something hit draco, that was when he started losing conscious, his vision went black and slid down to seamus shoulders.~~~~~~~~~~~~"Who do you think, would have done this tumas..... who had the audacity to do this" riddle asked to his most loyal servant. They were standing in the middle of so burned and half destroyed library, which was set fire by draco not a day before. "Draco malfoy, my lord" tumas replied. "How are you so sure tumas...... he is also a good servant to me, why would he do this?" "I don't think he came yesterday, just to talk with you about the blood traitor and our empress" Riddle looked at him curiously. "Think about it, my lord. He coming to meet you suddenly just to say about the weasley issue...... Library getting burned down when you were out, but he was still in our region..... the men died here in the fire, are not our guards, i smelled their magic aura, checked all of their presence, no one left your palace, except the ten guards you sent to ravage the muggles.....He could have just owled you yesterday, i think he was here more of sending you out of the kingdom, so he could come here" "So you are saying he is the one to do this?..... but why would he, burn down a library unnecessarily" "I too don't know my lord......Maybe this is an ancient library, it could have had something so powerful, that we didn't know about till now..... but whatever it is he doesn't want you to have it before him, i think we have to take him down.....Sir" "Hunt him tumas..... hunt him down, now and bring him to me...... Don't inform hermione about this, i like to give her a surprise" "As you wish my lord" tumas said and bowed, before disapparating with the other guards around them.
  
    Chapter Text
    This chapter may be found as disturbing to some and it is necessary to show her evilness and possessiveness, also to move the story. So just thought of a fair warning.
~~~~~~~~~~~~He was still lying on the bed, besides the place where draco vacated. It had what.... he don't know minutes maybe hours after the alarm rang throughout the castle, which means draco has succeeded in the plan and he was thinking about, how many things have happened in one day. From him getting humiliated in her chamber to making a deal with a malfoy helping him to escape the resistance. The door to the room opened and hermione walked in furiously with two of her guards behind her. "Ok, the truth, now!!...... what have you planned, how did they escaped" she asked. "Oh, they escaped....." he said innocently and smirked. Suddenly she yanked his collar chain and he practically fell down to the ground to stand on his knees before her. "That's it, you ungrateful pet.....I offered you a position of king, you declined it. I offered you as my pet, you're lucky, i still haven't killed you.... and you never stop planning against me" she slapped him across his face hard. "I already have said, you shouldn't show your stubbornness to your mistress no more, probably yesterday's punishment is not enough for you" Is she going to whip me again he thought. "Oh, don't worry.... I'm not going to whip you anymore, it's more than that". She turned and looked at her guards "Make my chamber ready and bring her there". Her? Who is 'her'? Helen? Like Knowing who he is thinking about hermione angrily yanked his chain once more and made her way to her chamber, pulling him with force, him crawling behind her. Moment's later they were in the chamber, ron kneeling beside her throne, she is sitting in her throne. Suddenly the two guards entered with a women and its not his wife.... It's susan bones. "Hello,susan. Had your breakfast?" hermione asked sweetly. "Ye.... yes, your highness" susan replies nervously, eyeing ron who was kneeling nude, with his chain in hermiones hand. "You among some of the maids in my castle, i like you so much, do you had any problems here, aren't you happy?" she asked. Susan nodded fervently. "That's what I thought...... That's why I gave some rights for you, i thought the women will stick together for one another. Thats why I gave you some rights" Susan nodded again. "Perhaps......A bit too much freedom, yeah?" she asked and susan looked up from the ground and shook her head. "Did you touch my pet, susan?"  "No, your highness". "Liar!!" hermione yelled, Susan flinched. "I'm bonded to him, i can find anyone who have been in contact with him in the last 24hours". "I'm sorry, your highness, it's just..... he was an old schoolmate and I thought.....". "You thought what?. You thought you could find his wife and tell him where she is? Thought you could seperate us? Taking him away from me? And what were you gonna do? Huh? Bring them together, help them to raise their children and to have a happy life?..... is that it?". she asked angrily. Susan shook her head and uncertainly looked at ron, who was staring back at her with tears in his eyes. Hermione stood from her throne and was walking towards her, on the way she conjured a sharp knife in her hands. She came to stand behind susan both of them at same height. She started to softy rub the other girls lips with the side of her knife. "Now, answer me. Did you kiss him, with this sweet lips?". Ron started speaking suddenly "Hermione listen, she doesn't know anything, please just let her go, I'll do anything". Hermione looked back and forth between susan and ron "Uh....I know what's happening here, love. Right? Do you love her ron? Now you don't want your wife then? Do you want susan ron?" "Hermione... Pleas-" "Shut it." she said loudly. She took old position behind Susan's back "you dare touch my pet and kiss him, why did you do it susan, say it. Do you love him? Do you like him? Now be honest you know I can use truth potion if I want" Susan nodded that she like ron, crying. "You dare lie to your queen? You dare to have feelings for 'my' pet?"  Suddenly with the knife she was rubbing on Susan's lips, she started cut her lips with her other hand holding her mouth. Susan screamed, her voice muffled by her closed mouth, blood spattered all in front of them. Ron tried to run and help, but her guards made him stand in his place. Her lips came with hermiones hand and susan fell down to the ground screaming and wheeping, the place where her mouth was, now just there is a big hole. Showing her whole teeth up and down. She touched there and covered her face, started to cry hard "Now everyone knows, what happens if they meddle with me, let it be a warning to my other servants..... take her back to her room, a guard stays with her, if she tries to cover it, whip her till she takes her hands off" she ordered and a guard that was holding ron, went and pulled susan by her hair to outside. "You bitch" ron snarled "you will die, i promise, i will kill you, you do this to her why? Because she just kissed me? It's just a kiss!!" Hermione laughed "Oh it's just a kiss you say. And you made me miserable in 6th year, just because Viktor krum pecked me once during yule ball, remember?". she said still laughing, ron looked at her unbelievably "You are mad" he said. "You could have just asked me to show your wife ron, i would have done it..... now because of you a girl just lost her beautiful face". "Then show me, show me helen..... Please" he asked "okay" she said and he looked surprised. "Okay?" he asked again to check he heard right. "Yes, okay ron.... Let's see your wife, your child's mother". She started walking again and the guard holding ron, started following her. They were walking through a big corridor that contains so many not so good looking rooms side by side, probably the guards room .Ron was so eager to see helen, to know she is okay, to talk to her once. He is nude, she'll think bad of him, but it's ok, atleast he knows she'll be fine. They reached the  end of the corridor, which was named as break room for the guards, also attached with the shower room. He don't know why are they here...... Hermione knocked on the door and a guard not wearing any loin cloth came out naked, bowed her, she said something to him and he led them in. The scene he saw, when he entered made his eyes go wide wide with shock, disgust and his cock which was already hard from not able to cum throbbing painfully with his own lust and Hermione's combined radiating from his bond with her. There was nearly 30 or 40 guards inside the room all nude, dick rock hard stroking there cocks and there is only a single women with them, who was lying on a guy on her stomach his dick inside her pussy, another guy also had his dick in her pussy. There was another one have his dick inside her ass. Her mouth was now filled with another two cocks. She was surrounded by the guards like bees surrounding honey getting fondled and fucked by the guards. Her body was red, bruised, damp with sweat looked like she had been bathing in their cum. He looked her dizziness filled face closely and screamed "NO!!!" , the women who was getting raped was Helen, his wife, the mother of his child. He was tightly surrounded by the guards holding him in place, he started crying trying desperately to get to her from the crucial punishment, to save her, to hold her. "Why? How could you do this? To me? To us? She is pregnant" he cried hard like a child in front of everyone. All the guards in the room laughed at him, but contuined what they were doing. Hermione took a chair from the side and sat on it "Don't be silly ronald, I'm not that cruel...... she is not pregnant anymore, because I killed your child, there is nothing inside her tummy anymore". she said and smiled at him. His world crumbled at hearing it, his child was killed by her. His whole body filled with rage, he punched two or three guards in the face and tried to get to her to choke her to death. But they he couldn't get past the guards. "I liked her so much, ron. She would have made a good maid for me and I would have let her live happily with more freedom than I ever gave to anyone....... if she wasn't you wife". "It's disgusting ronald, she carrying your child, i mean she is beautiful and all. But isn't it my right to become your child's mother, to raise our child together, afterall we have been having feeling to each other for seven years. I got quite jealous at her, which later turned into anger and now here she is". "Why ron, how could you do this to me? Why her? Why not me?" she asked her eyes watering, just a moment her vulnerability showed the old hermione. "You wanna know why? Because you are a arrogant little bitch and I promise you i will kill you". She rolled her eyes, wiped it with the back of her hand and sighed "Alright, then I will give you one last chance to save your wife, stroke yourself watching her getting fucked.....I know you want to cum, but not before them. If you cum before them, then she will be dead". Ron fell down to the ground broken, he never felt this much broken in his life before, he came near to this when he left her and harry and when fred died. But now, stroking himself watching his wife getting fucked, to save her life. Hearing his child had been killed even before it was born. Hermione released the cage surrounding the cock, he closed his eyes and started stroking his dick. "Open it, i want you to see what's happening in front of you.......I want to see you enjoying by watching your wife getting ganbanged". He opened his eyes, started stroking his cock slowly, because he know he'll be cumming in seconds in he goes fast. He wanted to save her, so determined he pushed all other thoughts to the back of his head and started stroking it. The guards were fucking her so fast, big and thick dicks, spreading her wide, using her all holes. Beating her to get out of her dizziness, her mouth slowly dribbling drops of blood. The guy fucking her ass, seemed to be on the edge, he started thrusting into her tight hole, furiously spanking her, it changed her shade from pink to bright red, soon she started maoning in pain or pleasure he don't know, but unconscious. The both guys fucking her simultaneously in her pussy came at the same time, biting her and kissing her wherever they could reach her body, they got up leaving blood smeared bite marks. The other guys too left her ass and mouth filled with cum, she was nearly going to faint, that's when hermione gone near her and yanked her hair, making her looking at him. "Look at him, Helen. Look at your husband, stroking his cock, watching you getting fucked by my guards" helen looked at him with sadness and disgust in her eyes. But ron know he should do it or she will be killed, hermione dragged helen by her hair towards him, thrown her at him, she lay before him where he was leaning and stroking without stopping. Hermione placed her one leg on Helen's neck "Look at her ron.... look at her eyes" she said and he looked, there he saw understanding, a sadness and love. "I want you to look at her eyes, when her life goes out of her" she said and pressed her feet hard, he heard a crack, like a bone getting broked. His and Helens eyes were still connected both lifeless. "I don't want you to waste your sperms for her anymore pet, as it is only mine now". She looked at the lifeless body at the bottom of her feet and sighed "What a way to go right?" she asked. Everyone of them laughed except ron, who looked dead, he could only be identified as alive by the tears falling down his eyes. She came and stood beside him and fondled his hair a bit "There is no one anymore between us ron...... only you and me and our children?" she smiled and whispered "Let's make some weasleys ron" she said and walked to the exit yanking his chain behind her, so that he was forced to move after her and he did move without protest. Forgetting the cause for his life anymore. "Throw the body outside in the trash, i don't want my castle to stink" she said loudly just before exiting out.

    "I can't believe this, why didn't you just said it to me there". "Are you joking, what can a ten wizards and a two muggles could have done againt thousands of death eaters and.....her" Draco woke up to the sounds of two guys yelling at each other, but stayed still don't want give up the sign, he is not asleep anymore. One of them is seamus and other was dean thomas, one of the old lions. "Listen.....I know, how you feel.....". Dean grabbed the collars of seamus and lifted him up "No you dont" he said and they glared at each other. Suddenly realising what he was doing, he dropped seamus to the ground, his eyes welled up with tears "Sorry seamus, im acting like an idiot. I need some time alone....Sorry". Dean walked over to the edge of the lake, where they have set three non magic camps in the shore. Seamus sighed, shooked his head and walked over to draco, who was lying on a bench, still acting like he is asleep. "If you done with your performance, can you please move so i can sit comfortably" seamus said and draco quit his performance and sat on the bench, beside him. "Im sorry about earlier, dean didnt believe you were helping us, so thought of kidnap you as an hostage...... Dont worry i made him to believe you" he said after looking at dracos scared face. "Why was he fighting, is there any problem in the plan. Oh my god, is he crying" he asked quietly. Seamus sighed again "Its luna". "Luna?.... You mean luna lovegood?. That crazy fruits eating witch friends of nargles or something". "Yeah.... yeah, she is her. She was killed by hermione during our capture". "So, why is......he crying?". "Dont you get it? He is crying for her...... they were married". Draco was surprised hearing the matching of the couple. So luna thomas, thats good too. "Dean was very strong, never saw him cry after dumbledore's death. Even when he heard the news of his parents were dead because of their muggle heritage, there was rage yes..... some tears, but never like this". "Luna was always there for him, they never spent time away from each other except when going to resistance missions". "Now she is not there anymore, he thought she was captured with us. I could have told him, then and there but then no one could have avoided him going into your wife's den". "Oh...Uh.....Ex....Ex wife actually" the guys who were making foods and preparing their bags near them sniggered. Draco glared at them "Oi eavesdropping is not so good things fellows" seamus said. "So is that why, you agreed to help ron?". "Nah, he promised if i helped you, he will not kill her, that we should never come before you again". "Then he is probably wrong.....If he doesnt kill her, then i will" dean said, now coming towards them. "Then i may have to drop out from your playgroup you know?" Draco said and dean lunged to attack him, but seamus pushed dean out of the way. "Lads, lets behave like a gentleman alright?... Dean if ron promised he will not kill her, then we wont, thats why draco is with us in this mission" he said to dean and turned towards draco "However, that doesnt change the fact of we punishing her..... there will be a punishment for her, dont worry we wont kill her, if ron promised you that, then its the resistance promise". They all nodded. "So, im not asking where we are.... Because i can say even you guys doesnt know that. But where are we going?". "Remember diagon alley, there is where we are going" draco stood surprised, the diagon alley was full of death eaters, they will get easily captured there, it is one of the main areas of hermiones rule, the place is now like death eaters vacation quarters, full of girls, drinks..... "Are you joking, there will be more death eaters than in the castle, if they caught us they will tear you into pieces". "If you are scared, you can go back to ex and have a nice time worshipping her pussy than being the real man and stand against the crimes". "What is your problem, with her?..... why do you want to kill her?". "What? Guys did you hear that? Why do we wanna kill her? Are you even in this world? Because she is a greedy little bitch, thats why" "Listen, i know she done some bad things.... but its all for voldemort, she wouldnt have done that, if she is not working under him". "As if...... draco you are not seeing with your head, you are seeing things with your heart. You love her, we can understand it, but what she done is not because she works for him. She works for herself..... she have brains, she know dark spells now, that even riddle doesnt know and she could easily kill him if there is a duel between them, because it is inevitable". Draco eyes widened at that "The prophe....Ho... how..... do you know that". "We know it before you, we are the resistance, you know. we were everywhere" dean said. "Then you would also had some ways to kill her already then". "Yes, but she is not our only target, we have to take riddle too.... the only solution to take them both is a fight between them, that's why after after knowing the prophecy we were waiting for the right opportunity".  "And when the right moment comes, we need manpower, thats why we are going to diagon alley, to recruit teengers, we have already trained them well, how to be a spy, they are living within your death eaters there, with fake death marks ofcourse..... very skillfull lads, just five years younger than us, children's of wizards and witches, killed during the war. They were helped by ron to live with us after they become orphans and trained well for the battle". "Ok, ok. That's too fast, not easy to process....Ooh" Draco said and shook his head. Dean smiled at that "Whatever just remember, the battle is not between good and evil. its between evil and evil. We are just waiting for the fish to bite". "Well, ok..... But I can't decide that's a good quote or not" draco said and dean shook his head. "Alright everyone, let's get going then shall we?" draco was going to use his wand to freshen up himself, but seamus took his wand from his hands. "What was that for". "Because, if you use magic they could trace you" . "Don't be silly, no one could do that" "Your ex could, riddle could and some of the other dark wizards too". "Is there really something like that?". "There are many things like that, tracing magic core of someone, as you are being sure searched everywhere now you should not use your magic. Preventing someone to use their magic in a specific area, using their blood.... you could even use someone else's blood who is bonded to you, to make you non magical, in a specific area that is and.....". "Ok, sorry. I won't... quite the lecture, god....." Draco put his wand back into his pants and started walking with everyone, leaving the area travelling towards, the diagon alley.

    "You wanted to see me father?" Atin asked bowing."Yes.... yes I have atin" tumas said.Atin is tumas son, he was a young, hot blooded 19 yeared teenage wizard, always ready to do any work, fast,smart and skillful. His hobby is mostly to hunt the werewolves and the muggles, he knows many ancient fighting techniques. He also likes to learn & perform new spells or curses on muggle children's.But he also have an disadvantage, he was so greedy and selfish. He wants to be like the dark lord, wanted to be so powerful. To sit in the throne of the Terra, the throne especially made for the wizard or witch who rules the whole world. Which is currently owned by tom riddle.Tumas warned him many times for even having thoughts like that, if the dark lord came to know about his intentions, then he'll be sure to be dead.There had many fights between the father and son, on the matters of who is the big power.Atin also asked tumas many times to give up his job for him as he is not an old man like his father and Can serve the dark lord more efficiently, showing his true capabilities.Tumas thought of giving him a chance to fight in a mission, one he'll get succeeded or atleast he will understand the dangers in it and give up his poisonous ideas. And this mission of finding draco is not so dangerous, he just have to find a missing person.Obviously he would be hiding somewhere in the malfoy manor."Dark lord, gave me an important mission to complete, atin..... and I wanted to give you a chance, you have to hunt someone and bring them to the dark lord alive, i repeat alive. Do not kill" tumas continued."I'm not a psycho father, I'm not in an addiction to kill someone"."Don't lie to me.....I saw you, kill that two muggle kids, just because the girl doesn't want to sleep with you"."I liked the girl, she doesn't liked me back, it's not my fault. It's not a mission. But this is a mission and I will complete it as you tell father". Atin said"As you have once told before...... I'm an old man, not young anymore, it's hard for me to hunt someone.... That's why I suggested you to the dark lord......""You suggested me to the dark lord?" Atin asked surprised and excited."Don't talk in between" tumas said gritting his teeth."Sorry father" atin glared back."I want you to find draco malfoy, son of ex active death eater, lucius malfoy, bring him to dark lord. That's it. If your work is good, I'll put a word for you to him"Atin bowed "Thank you for believing in me father, I'm going now" he bowed once and left.Tumas sighed and looked up at the sky worriedly.~~~~~~~~~~~~"Parents lost their child, children's becoming orphans again, wife witnessing her husband's murder, husband getting forced to watch his wife getting raped and to die" he said crying, no more words coming out of his mouth, voice getting chocked on his own sadness.It was night, they decided to call it off for a nap in a place looking like a drought land, near by a dessert, they had some alcohol and sure now they sitting in a circle, fire burning in the centre.Sometimes later they started talking about their lives and now about the day the resistance camp were destroyed."My luna, i didn't even get to say goodbye to her" dean said tear drops falling like rain drops.Draco don't know why, but he felt kind of guilty, maybe from knowing all this and didn't care before.He had been a good, loyal servant for her, like his father had been to voldemort."Dean..... you had it, enough.come on, everyboo'y just get ov...r with i.....nd call it a night, gud naght". Seamus slurred dizzily.Soon after one by one fallen asleep except Draco."Exkis my....I have to pissssss" he said and went a few feet away from them and started pissing.Suddenly a scorpion came near to bite his feet, he lifted his legs and killed it.He smiled happily as he the saw the scorpion lying there killed it and went back to lie down on the camp bed.Obviously forgetting that he just killed the scoring by using his wand as an instant reflex rather than using his boots to kill the scorpion.

    "Where does this path leads to?" Atin asked to one of his guards."To the left there is diagon alley and a muggle town to the right sir".Atin didn't waste the time after the mission was assigned to him, he was very determined to catch this draco malfoy and bring him to the dark lord.So the next moment he was searching the whole country, sending of his family guards to all over the world in different directions.He had been leading a group of death eaters on his own, that's when a trace of magic used was found. It perfectly matched with the malfoy guy's."Call all of our guards back, one part to that muggle town and another to the diagon alley"."But sir, there are more than 100 of us and diagon alley is under the control of that dark witch.... they may think we are a war group"."Let them think it, saini. Why? Are you scared of fighting against a bloody muggle witch? She is just a women, for fucks sake" atin said and other guards laughed.The guard looked unsure."Alright, I'm not compelling you, you could rest here" atin said and pointed his wand at him."No, no my lord. I'm not scared, I'm ready to follow your orders". he said bowing his head and kneeling in front of him."All good then, tell them to reach, before us there....I don't want to be late".He nodded and every one started following atin.~~~~~~~~~~~~~"Alright we are going to enter there, they'll be checking our forearms, try not to erase the marks"."I don't need it, i already have one"."Okay and be careful, one mistake is enough to get us killed, once the alarm went on, no one could apparate in and out of here..... the same dark arts method used in the castle".Draco and the resistance reached the diagon alley, to retrieve the spies, they could have sent owls, but which would be easily caught by the guards surrounding the place.They entered one by one, wearing hoods, draco hiding his face, his hair colour changed. There were guards checking their death marks, just seeing them and if they decided to trace it, it'll show off it is fake.Draco entered the through the entrance and observed the surrounding, where once there was books, wands and pet shops z where once there was children's and their families bustling in and out of shops to buy sweets, school kits, now stood destroyed shops, liquor shops, slut clubs, death eaters fighting, fucking women openly. The whole place turned to something disgusting. He looked up, far away he could still see the ghost of hogwarts, which once stood to the height of the sky proud and sublime.His eyes welled up in the memory of his school days.A finger tap on his shoulders woke him from his deja vu "Are you okay" it was dean."Yeah.... just some old memories" draco said and showed a sad smile."This is the first time in five years you are visiting here right? Didn't care about our school grounds huh?" he asked and draco felt ashamed.He never even thought about this place, his school or the other students and their families that died in the war fighting. Only serving to Hermione and having sex with slaves, drinking, spending lot's of money.When draco was quiet, dean continued "It's okay, anytime is a good time to change..... also good for you, because if you visited here before, im sure our group rounding outside would have killed you at the first site" he smiled and walked ahead, leaving a baffled.They reached the leaky cauldron, which still looks good "How does this place still looks good?" draco asked."Fine liquor store, not hated by the death eaters" Seamus said and he nodded.They nodded, the bar where once madam rosmerta served now a guy with bad head and yellow teeth stood.Dean grabbed his hand and they walked to the bartender. The others seperated and sat on the different tables in pairs.Dean knocked twice on the table, the bartender turned around "Just a minute sir...... okay what do you wish to have?" he asked.Dean showed him forearm and lightly rubbed the death mark and the end of it, the smile on the face of bartender slowly faded.Dean picked some galleons from his pouch and put it in the table "The cheapest one here" the guy nodded and shown his thumb toward the stairs."Gerald, show the gentleman the loo in the top floor" he said and a very lean guy came towards them and led them upstairs.Draco went behind the lean guy, to follow him through the wooden corridor but dean grabbed him backwards towards another closed door in the mid corridor."Where do you think you are going?" dean asked."Don't we have to follow him to the loo?" "Why do you want to go to the loo?""No... but, that's why you gave the galleons to him, i don't want to waste money".Dean sighed "It's a code among the resistance, he hid all of them in here, without the knowledge of other death eaters, so they will be safe" he said pointing to the locked door behind them."Then let's go in""No.... we have to wait for others, to go in at once, regular visits to a closed door, rise suspicions".Soon the guys in pairs came in, dean nodded towards seamus, who nodded back in acknowledgement.He then opened the door, which very much to dracos surprise opened without any key. There was one more surprise inside, it was not a small room inside, it is a big hall way, with bed bunks side by side and a black board at the end of the hall way in the wall.Draco removed his hood, just then "Draco malfoy.....A malfoy" a boy maybe 18 or 19 just five years older than him said to the others loud and angrily.Another boy lunged at him from another side, before he touch Draco, seamus tackled him to the ground "woah, easy.....easy there lads. He is here to help us"."Help? What help? Is he going to bring my parents back?" the boy, who seamus tackled to the ground asked angrily looking straight to Draco's eyes."Listen, he is really here to help us, he proved it to us, besides ron believes him..... if we want to save him, then he is the only way here".On the mention of ronald weasley's name every one of the teens got calm."Okay, can you please let me go now" the guy below seamus asked slightly strangled and he let him get up."How are we going to save him sir, it nearly broke our heart to here he was captured""Yeah..... but there is still hope, as he is alive"."He saved me, when the lucius malfoy killed my parents before my eyes, he burned my mother alive and ron gave me a meaning to live my life"."We'll do anything to save him, even give up our lives..... just say what we have to do?".Draco was clearly taken aback, he didn't expect the weasley to be an hero character here, he thought of him as more of a side kick from hogwarts, he also felt guilt at the mention of his father and his family name."Ron wouldn't want you guys to give up your lives for him, he wants you all to live your lives for yourself" seamus said."And there is a plan to save him....A plan of attack" dean said."Attack who, sir?"."Attack the dark witch castle and just fight some ordinary death eaters".All of the boys face crunched up with fear."Guys, don't worry we made sure to avoid coming face to face with her, there will be no big fights and you'll do this if you want ron back".All of them nodded and dean started explaining his plans of attack on the board.~~~~~~~~~~~On the same time, just outside the leaky cauldorn......."My lord, the guys are so tired, they searched everywhere..... and would like some break to gear up themselves, if you don't mind" the guard said.Atin sighed "I could have rather shepered a group of buffaloes than spending all the money for you idiots once an hour" he said frustrated."Fifteen minutes..... and this is your last break today, say it to everyone" he said and the guy nodded.Atin turned around and walked into the leaky, gone straight to the bartender.He sat on one of the stools and dropped some galleons on to the table, knocked twice on the table, he spent more money for the break of the guards, so to avoid much travel expense he said "The Cheapest one" the guy looked at him curiously and rubbed the death mark on Atin's hand.When it doesn't fade, his eyes went wide with shock and looked at atin.Atin looked him blankly for a minute and like getting why he is acting weird, he grabbed the collars of the bartender and yanked him nearly over the table "Where is he?" he asked angrily.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~On the first floor of the leaky, dean just finished telling his plans."That's it.....if we going to just act according to this, everything will happen smoothly" dean finished saying."Guys.... can you feel it?" a boy asked."Feel.....what?" seamus asked."This sound...... from down, it is quite unusually" the boy explained.True to his words, the atmosphere was so deathly silent.Suddenly dean's eyes widened with realisation, get out through the window, he said and guys near the window, with four members of the resistance started to escape through it.The other half, on the opposite side, where there is no window, came to stand in the centre behind dean, seamus and Draco, who all were standing, there wands pointed towards the door.All of a sudden, there was a big thud noice and the wooden floor they are standing on crumbled.......
  
    Chapter Text
    Dean, seamus and draco along with five other teenage boys and two muggles from the resistance member fell to the ground floor from above, where the wooden floor had been broken.The others luckily escaped through the windows.A teenage boy, who must the same age as the other boys stood before them, one hand tightly clutching a wand and other hand circling around the neck of the bartender who looked very scared.Draco looked around, the leaky bar was big, so its not so difficult for the more than 100 death eaters to stand around them, pointing their wands to curse at them."Who is draco here?" the youngest one asked.Draco held up his hand "And can i know, who is asking"."Yes, sure. Might help you when you say to the dark lord, who captured you.... the name is atin, Atin tumas. A loyal servant to the dark lord".Draco laughed "You mean, a slave?" he asked and dean elbowed him to shut his mouth as they were still sitting on the floor and the alarm of the diagon alley started to ring loudly.So there is no way, they are going to apparate out of their, neither they could wait for help, as the others would have definitely escaped.The motto of the resistance, that when your partner got stuck in a mission, where there seems no way to help them, then they shouldnt... the remaining one should complete the mission."You do have a dumb brain, like they say....as opposite to your father. Standing against the dark lord, using magic when you are a wanted person and talking shit to my face, when im pointing my wand at you.... You sure you dont have a brain injury?"The boy who was sitting beside dean, called him and showed a lighter he had in his pocket and winked. Dean nodded."What?" dean asked furious. "You used magic? Were you trying to trap us to the dark lord?"he asked standing up."Of course not, still you guys didnt believe me? I would never do that!!""Or maybe....I did....but it should be at the booze of the drink, i swear". draco stood too."What ever, now its all over, this guy..... what was your name again?" dean asked."Atin..... Atin tumas" he said and like every other death eaters watching the two fighting, calmly.They all were fully focused on dean and draco, no one saw the boy slowly crawling into their crowd and getting behind the bar table, where numerous bottles are shacked up."....... still it doesnt change the fact, we are going to get..... Sorry what was your name again, i keep on forgetting it" draco asked this time.Atin sighed frustrated "My name is Atin...... ATIN TUMAS!! Get it?""Yeah. Sorry buddy dont get tensed, dont you want us to tell the dark lord your name?" dean said.Suddenly the boy made a run across the bar, thrown a bottle, cloth stuffed in it and the tip of it was on fire.The two muggles started running first with four of the teenage boys.Dean pulled draco and seamus, started running to the door followed by the boy.Others covered themselves, because as soon as the bottle hit the bar floor it burst out loudly, with a bang.The whole bar started crumbling, everyone buzzling through the single door, the trio made near the exit of the diagon alley where two guys were waiting for them to apparate to the place where the others are waiting.The wall of the bar broke again with a spell of 'Bombarda Maxima' used by atin. Some of the death eaters getting crushed, he and some other death eaters came through the made hole.More than 100 of death eaters started running after them, atin in front of them throwing curses to stop them. The two muggle resistance members, unlike the four boys had no wands to dodge the curses or to protect themselves got killed while running.The trio dislodging some of them and escaping some of them, they exited through the gate, one guy apparated with the four boys first and just before the trio touch the another guys hand, draco noticed the boy who was following them fell down at the gate, stangled by a chain, which got his legs tied."Wait, the boy" draco said."No.... leave him, we must escape" dean said."Are you idiot..... he is just a kid" he said and ran back to save him."No, draco. Come back".Draco picked up the boy and used his wand to release him, at the same time a deadly curse thrown by atin, hit draco on his back and legs, he fell down to the ground."Mr.Malfoy" the boy said and tried to pick him."No, they are near.... you cant drag me. Go on save yourself ill protect you" he said making up a week protego shield."Im sorry, Mr. Malfoy" he said crying.Draco smiled "You can just call me draco..... now go on!!"The boy nodded and ran outside, touched their hands and all four of them apparated.Draco sighed and started laughing loudly, so loudly still lying on the floorThe death eaters sorrounded him. Atin kneeled beside a laughing draco "Oh, how pity..... lets go now shall we?""Yes, pity..... how pity of you" draco said still laughing."Me?....(laugh), im not the one going to die with the hands of dark lord, you are"."Yes, but you are his slave, just a slave"."The smile on the face of atin vanished "what im? Im slave? Im atin, his loyal servant, he will make me a king when i bring you to him"."Who told you? You are just a pathetic little boy, who think you can be something more than you are..... but you are just a little cunt" draco said taking out his old form.Atin was on the edge of breaking loose, he picked up half of draco by grabbing his collars. "Shut up, don't talk shut up" he started chanting, atin has a problem of mentally breakingdown when he gets humiliated, that's why he killed the muggle couple, he loses his sense, because she didn't want him. She rejected him.Now getting humiliated in front of 100 of death eaters, he couldn't help it, draco really has to shut his mouth or he will loose his sense again.But draco didn't stop, his plan seems like he wanted to die here, before meeting the dark lord, to avoid the situation of him knowing about the prophecy, to save hermione......"You will be nothing, more than an obedient servant......." that did it, atin picked up a heavy stone lying nearby him and dropped it at dracos face with such force.Even the death eaters around him got scared, their eyes went wide at his psychotic behaviour.He picked it up and dropped it again, like a mad man chanting "Shut up, shut up, shut up..." he kept on doing it until dracos face became nothing more than a cruelly crushed blood and bone mess.

    Two days, it had been two days since helen died and here he was getting continously raped by her on her bed.After killing his wife, she brought him here and they have been having continuous sex, she on top him, binding him, fucking him all she wants, like a bloody dominatrix and he was crying on shame.They have break for food, bath and loo. She said her guards not to disturb them until she come out of this room.Just a few moments after his wife was killed and here he is unintentionally getting ready whenever she wants to ride him because of the uncontrollable lust for her, he don't know from where it was coming. Maybe just from seeing her pale pink nude body, big perfect round breast bouncing, or her fat spankable ass slapping on his thighs, her flat stomach and her navel....He just wants to fuck her all the time, just to be near her all the time, a close contact. Based on the amount of cum he came inside, her stomach would have be full now, maybe that's why she is not so hungry.He even dared to think of a growing feeling of love towards her, but when he thinks of it, the face of helen comes in front of him, what could have been.....He don't want to be with her, to love her or to have sex with her, but he couldn't control it. He have to resist this, for all the people who lost their life fighting against the evil.He was thinking all of this, when hermione emerged from the loo as the day she was born.She looked at him "I think you want a go again?" she said smirking at him.He looked down at himself and noted his traitorous dick was was flaccid after the last round minutes before got hard once more. He groaned inwards.She got on the bed and started straddling him, one leg slowly passing over him to get his dick straight under her pussy, she slowly started to slid it inside her.They both moaned loudly at the contact, he experiencing her tightness, like she has a virgin pussy and she liked getting filled by her favourite dick.As soon as she was settled, bend towards him and kissed him, slowly moving downwards kissing his neck and twisting his nipples between her thumb and forefinger. She started moving taking him fully inside her and trying to reach her ultimate goal of milking his balls empty.He graoned when she nibbled and sucked his neck, intentionally leaving bite marks to show who own him, she suddenly laughed "To tell you ron, i fucked some dark wizards once a month before, because I wanted to fill the void in me. But the truth is no one made me satisfied, i never felt this much ecstatic before" with that she started to bounce her tight arse, the little gyriffindor lioness he known ages ago taking control over, hand tightly choking him, her eyes rolled back, still smiling and he hated it.She started to move fast, bouncing on his thighs, the skin on skin of slapping sound echoeing the walls of her room.Suddenly she stilled on the tip of his cock smiling mischievously."Your dick is mine ron......your cum is mine and mine alone......Aren't you feel ashamed ron? Fucking me just moments after your wife died throbbing and gasping for air under my feet? Fucking the same women who killed her?". Ron's eyes started to release tears and he nodded, his body desperately boiling with lust and rage, he tried to thrust upwards, but she used one hand to twist a nipple of him forcefully and another to still his hips."Answer me and you can fuck me all you want"."Ye....Yes!!.....I.... Please.....I feel so as.... ashamed" he said his words choking on his tears."And you still want me? Wanted to make love to me? To knock me up?"."Yes!! Please.... Please" he started moaning and trying so hard not to shove himself deep inside her".She bend again, huskily whispering in his ears "Then fuck me ron...... knock me up, give me a child, let's make more weasleys".The mention of child made him remember the one she killed, suddenly shouting he flipped them over and roughly plunged in.She screamed in pain, but he ignoring her started pounding her."You Bitch, you dare to kill my child.... I'm going to kill you, kill you just by fucking you"."Yes..... do it, do it.... kill me if you could" she said smiling sort of challenging him."You are such a slut!!" he screamed but kept on thrusting her."Yes, im a slut..... slut for you ron" they were fucking in missionary, so she wrapped her legs tightly around his hips, pulling him more close. Her hands around his neck, grabbing him and kissing him, to show something, a feel of a sudden tenderness, an old feeling of familiar calmness took over him.The calmness he had when he was having boys talk in his dorm with other boys, sitting with harry and hermione in the gryffindor common room.Having lunch with them, playing quidditch, in the name of doing homework, the quick secret glances they gave each other......Suddenly opening his eyes and to avoid getting those feelings of closeness with her, he slapped her hard on the face and she slapped him back with the same force.Both of the them still pulling their closer, he started practically stabbing her with his dick, the bed creaking hitting the wall on the side of headboard.The sound echoing even outside of her room, the guards, the maids started to look each other awkwardly."Yes..... give it ron!!..... give it to me, fertilize my eggs. Fill me, fill me full with your cum...... Fill my womb, give me a weasley" she screamed and whined looking up at the ceiling tightly hugging him, their body bind so tight without even a gap for air to pass through.They both become breathless, his balls slapping on her gorgeous arse. She came once again screaming his name in high pitch, biting on his shoulders and scratching with her sharp nails on his back, his skin leaking out patches of blood from her doings, he screamed too.Her boobs felt like a pillow under his chest, as he was crushing her between the bed and himself, she tightly locking her ankles on the back of his arse, spreading more for him, so he will cum more deeper in her.Finally, he cummed inside her, a large load of cum he ever released in his life, the hot spunk travelling straight to her womb.The realisation of the heat of his seamen filling her up, suddenly filled her eyes with happy tears, she felt like the hermione before the war.She took hold of his face and kissed him deeply, still tears falling down her cheeks.Suddenly both of their eyes went white, a train of memories started to run through their mind.The happy moments of them at the burrow, playing with each other, playful bickering, sharing foods, saving her from the troll, seeing her when he opening his eyes when he was in his death bed of 6th year, him returning to her after destroying horcrux, the desperate kiss to show their love to each other between the battle, a connection of both their minds. Seeing the same things, feeling the same feeling.They both slowly opened their tears filled eyes, broke their kiss "I love you" she said and looked at him expectantly.He don't know why he said it, but he did "I love you too" and she laughed, her eyes openly making tears fall down, like a damn broke.~~~~~~~~~~~~~Moments later, they were lying in the bed beside each other, snuggled so closely.She wrapped her arms across his chest, holding him possessively. Laying her head on his shoulders, both still naked."Five years..... For five years, this had been my dream, we snuggled closer in a bed, you saying that you love me" said said happy but teary eyed.He listened silently, not knowing what to do or say, suspicious of his own behaviour."I lost everyone i love ron, a beautiful family, molly, arthur, good lot of brothers, a best friend, a girl who was practically my sister.....I didn't wanted to kill her ron. But i had to save you, i couldn't lose you, im sorry, im sorry....I love you". she said and broke down, he tears pooling on his chest.His fucking old behaviors wouldn't leave him, so he wrapped his hands around her and brought her tight to him, doesn't want to see or hear her crying, hating her tears."I will make everything right ron.....I promise. I promise, i will do anything to bring us together, change everything back.... you and me will be the king and queen. I want a life ron, a life full of us....you, me and our children, the young granger-weasleys" she chukled."I just want you with me, nothing more..... Please don't go away from me" she said looking like a small kid, big brown eyes wide and full of tears, for a moment her evilness lost, showing his hermione, full of vulnerability, weakness only shown to him and harry.The beautiful, vile and proud women he seen all these years begging him to stay with her, exposed before him, he don't know what to say, he said the one thing, she asked "I love you and I will never leave you, i promise" he don't know if it was true or not.But it stopped her sadness, she smiled happily, kissed him once more affectionately and snuggled closer, soon asleep snoring.Next to ron, who was fighting a battle within himself of whether he could kill her or not.

    "You did what?!!" tumas shouted angrily."I specifically told you not to kill him and you did just that? You are an insult to me and our family name, you don't deserve to serve the dark lord"."Tumas" riddle said coming to stand beside tumas.After arriving back to the palace of riddle, he told them that he killed Draco, so now tumas was shouting at a rage boiling atin, for his irresponsibility before dark lord."My lord, I'm sorry Im feeling disgusted myself..... just forgive him this once, you will never see him again, I'll make......"."Its alright tumas" riddle said and tumas looked at him in disbelief."What's your name" now he asked directly to atin."Atin, my lord.... just atin as my father was ashamed of me, i decided to not anymore be a part of it".Something about him reminded riddle of himself, a feeling of taking whatever he wanted and a sense of greed in his eyes."I liked you so much, will you serve for me?"."My lord, he doesn't have any experience..... he is just a boy" tumas said to riddle."Tumas, will you do whatever i ask you to?" he asked."I will serve loyally to whoever sits in the throne of terra" he said back bowing his head."Then resign and give your post of my loyal guard to your son, he will have access to all next to me" tumas looked at riddle shocked, a feeling of disbelief and hurt etched on his face."Now, atin, i have a task for you to complete.... follow me" he said and walked into the living room, closely followed by atin, who on the way pushed his father to the floor with his shoulders saying "Move away old man".They reached the room and riddle poured two cups of tea for atin and himself. A loyal guard is not just a person to serve me, he is also known as the next ruler". he said and atin piped up."So, i expect you to do it nice"."You will never have to worry about that my lord, i will take care of everything neatly"."Good to hear.... now the task is to bring that dark witch over here for me".Suddenly atin bowed "my lord, don't get offence, but I have to say my thought..... the mudblood, do not deserve to rule any kingdom, moreover making her as your queen is......"."Don't worry atin, she'll be a queen just for the name..I will treat as a toy only using her for my sexual exploitation"Atin smiled "She deserves that my lord, but I have a wish"."Go on"."She is going to get captured anyway, if you don't mind..... can i have her kingdom to myself"Riddle smiled "Take control over the place and send her here, i will gift it to you once our bond is complete".~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"It's good he is dead by his own party, I was going to kill him anyways" a boy said.Suddenly another guy lunged at him and they started roll on the muddy ground and started punching each other's face."Oi, quit it" seamus shouted, they stopped and stood, glaring at each other"He attacked me first" the first one said."Why did you attack him" seamus asked the second one."He talked bad about Mr. Draco, that's why" the other boys looked at him in surprise."He saved my life yesterday, he is the only reason, im standing fully today before you all"."So.... you are supporting a malfoy now?!!. He is the reason you're parents are dead, remember?"."I'm not supporting him, I'm just saying he don't deserve this, I'm not supporting a malfoy..... I'm just asking to shut your mouths about mr.draco"."Alright, that's it.... we are not here to debate about if Draco is good or bad guy...... we have to save ron remember" Dean said coming towards the group."Alright". "Sorry". "Okay" were the things the boys murmured back."Let's get your gear up, we are leaving right this instance and remember, just to follow our plan".~~~~~~~~~~~~~Hermione felt like she was in heaven.They were both in the big bath tub or big jacuzzi, which can fit nearly twenty people.They are both naked, minutes before they completed another one of their sex sessions in the water, making slow and beautiful love making.Now he is washing her, applying soap on her back, his strong arms making her warm between her legs once again.She wanted this to never end, to keep on going, to have his hands permanently fixed on her, always touching her.It would all become true, but before that she has a mission to complete. To kill the dark lord.Because he is man of his words, if he said he would make her his queen and enslave her then he will just do that.But she would kill him before that and if by the things said in that prophecy is true, she will win.Ron who was washing her hair by shampoo stopped his movements and she looked around to find a guard, bowing, beside their tub, panting."What is it?" she asked."Your highness, some unknown guy with some troops is here to meet you and we highly suspect it would be the dark Lord's men".She stood, used the guards hand to get out of the tub naked and with a movement of her hand, she dressed like her own self."Be here sweetheart, I'll be right back" she said to ron and exited the bathroom.Ron glared at the way she just gone through, guarded by two outside.He had been washing her body all her places, just after another fuck.All the time, trying hard not to drown her under the water until the breathing stops.He is breathing deeply trying to make his breathing return to normal.That's when he heard the two guards outside, fell down with a thud.

    Two guys walked in, wearing the same loin cloths."Didn't think you would be an expensive pet" "Well, what did you thought, he is ron after all""Dean" "Seamus" he said exclaimed loudly, happily and then realizing where he is he spoke quietly "Dean" "seamus"......"how did you guys get in"."Thought you would ask how we are first..... but it's alright".Ron got out of the tub naked coming eagerly to hug them both "Ugh.... ron, oh my god.... wear some clothes man"."Ugh....I think, the image traced permanently into my mind, i can't get it out even if i closed my eyes"Ron flushed "Sorry, she wouldn't let me wear any clothes..... hey, i asked you guys something, what are you two doing here"."Rescuing you from here of course, you idiot".Ron didn't know why suddenly he lost all the happiness, he now have a way to get out, a way to escape this torture and........ from her."We don't have time, come on" dean said throwing a towel toward him and pulling him with them. He following them fast and with a heavy heart.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~She walked into her meeting room, where a young teenage boy with four older death eaters stood waiting for her.She noticed he was watching her with lust filled eyes and she felt disgust all of a sudden."Your highness, this are the people who visited you tonight" her head guard told her bowing his head."Hello, little princess" the boy said and the other with him laughed.Her head guard stood and  started walking towards him with a challenging stance, but she signaled him to stop."Usually everyone bows before me, when they are addressing me" she said with the most kindness she could muster."Aw, i think little princess misunderstood our intentions then" he snapped his fingers, suddenly thousands and thousands of dark Lords death eaters entering through every entrance surrounding her and her guards, she understands they even would have already surrounded the castle now."Dark lord wanted me to bring you to him mudblood..... so you have two options now"."Surrender and submit your kingdom and guards to me, i will bring you to dark lord..... where you will be living happily as his fuck toy, while I rule your lands"."Or fight me and die, so I could bring you to the dark lord with just your mudblood body"."Either way, i will take you to him". She looked around at her guards, ready to fight just waiting for her words looking at her with expectation.And she know it's time, she surrender, but not to lose..... to win.But ron is here, will he do something to him, no as long she submits, he will just let him go as he is only her pet and have no personal vengeance against him."Alright, I'll go" she said making her guards lowering their weapons, looking at her disbelievingly.

    Ron, dean and seamus came through the way draco escaped them the other night.They came to know the castle was taken by dark lord's army. Thankfully they had the map, which draco already given them before they gone to the diagon alley.They all were hiding in the middle of the forest near the lake, guarded by the resistance.Ron was given a dress as soon he arrived, when he was wearing it, a boy stood near him tried to touch a deep scar on his shoulders, which looked like a bite mark."As soon as the boy touched it "Don't!! Touch me!!!..." he bellowed, looking angrily at the boy.The others flinched, the birds on the trees flew away scared.Ron sighed, shook his head "Im sorry thomas" he said looking at the boy."Its ok sir. You still remember my name...... and how did that happened" he asked pointing a finger at the bite mark.Ron blushed "Its ah....Umm...Ah". "Guys thats enough, he is tired, he will tell you later" seamus said coming towards him with a vile of some kind of liquid."Its alright, we understand" he said and gave ron the vile "its a replenishing potion" and ron drank it. Soon he felt like he is in his old form, before he met her.Everyone hugged him and expressed their gratitudes."So, what's our next plan, how are we going to kill her" dean asked."Where is Draco?" he asked and dean shook his head sadly."Helen was in there and she killed her before my eyes" ron said trying to force back the tears that threatened to fall.All the others around him looked at each other with wide eyes."The baby?". One of the resistances asked.He shook his head."Ron...." Seamus started.But he held up his hands to stop him "No, no seamus..... save it for later. We must complete the mission and i know you all lost someone you loved dearly, we have only us and shouldn't be afraid to sacrifice yourself to kill them. Because there is no more life, if we lost"."What's our plan now, how are we going to kill her?"."Well, im not sure it'll be her or him"."No. But the prophecy said sh......"."We can't put our lives on risk based on a damn prophecy"."Okay, what do we do then, you are the leader your wish"."We have to get back into the castle"."What? Are you joking?"."We have to it's the only way"."I don't see any fucking way in that except going straight to heaven..... or hell"."The castle is surrounded by dark Lord's army, her guards and maids are in the prison now. She is captured & only one will be alive between him and her"."Imagine if the dark lord comes back by killing her or if she comes back, do you think his guards will let her alive?"."Yeah. How can we 20 can take two army?""They each have thousands of death eater soldiers"."Listen i know I'm not talking any sense here, but there is a plan, a chance to live our lives and this plan is going to work.  I know it could be our death, but who cares, we are going to die anyways.... Imagine if one of them won and no one is there to stop them, do you think they will stop?"."These boys here can have a life, a family?.... No, i don't think so, the same fate of us will be reflected on them.""So I'm going to ask this once more, it's either we do or we die"Ron turned to the side of the boys, among which some of them looked terrified and others sad."Guys. Listen, if you don't want to join us, then don't. Go, run from us.... try to make a living, a girl who loves you truly, a family, some money. But be sure to not get captured in the eyes of death eaters"."We are coming with you sir"."We want to live a life like that. But we don't want to live like that in fear"."If we don't live like that now, then another life then"."I'm sorry, i had made you fight for me" ron started."No, Sir. It's our fate. You saved us. We are fighting for ourselves, Without you we sure we will be dead"."Or would have spent our life as some disgusting pets under them licking there shoes".Ron flinched on the word pet."Okay, so what's your plan, how are we going to do this". Another one of the resistance asked.Ron smiled mischievously and winked at them.

    "Seriously ron, this is the shittiest idea ever" seamus groaned."Hey you guys said it yourself, we can't take down more than 2000 death eaters with 20...." ron said."So?"."So.... if we want to win, we need an army"."And you came up with a plan of having a pep talk with her general and you think they'll help us?" seamus said pointing between themselves.Ron and seamus gone back in through one of the hidden ways, to talk with the minister guard of Hermione's army.They were near the prisons and waiting for the guards to move away, so they can get in and release them, also signal others to enter in."Come on, i think It's the break time" ron said, the guards moved away and they both got in.The prison were filled full of them, but its also easy to accommodate all of them as there is a lot of prison rooms.They arrived were the general is."Hey....You there, hey old man"."You" snarled the head general."You red headed pet of my empress, what are you doing in our castle"."Hey.... quit it for 5 minutes, will you?".The guard sighed "What is it?" he asked and looked up and down."Listen what I'm going to tell is.... you are not going to like it, but you have to if you all want to live or avoid being a pet"."Of course i will not be a pet, I'm the head guard""Yeah, but sadly you are old, they need young death eaters, besides you want to save your fellow troops and your empress don't you?".He nodded."Then, i have a plan, but for that, all of your guys will do what I say and fight for me...."He looked at ron suspiciously. "Why do we fight for you, you are the resistencia, we don't fight for your freedom ya....""Im with you, i support my Mistress, i don't want anything happening to her and you have to obey me now. Only, if you want to live of course".Seamus looked at ron with a smirk, ron was really a master at manipulating people, just like he had been since the resistance formed."Okay, we will obey you, now what your plan".~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"Sir. We got everyone, maids and slaves are ready to get sold in auctions"."All her guards are imprisoned, waiting for their deaths".The two guards said bowed before atin, who was looking around Hermione's chamber with astonishment."Hmm.....I really liked the mudblood's throne, it looks so good, doesn't it?".He asked back to them, looking at the throne with mesmerization.The throne was really beautiful and made especially for hermione, it was made in a model of her own wish, which looked like peacock flashing it's wings, the throne made in silver and diamond stones, two big head sized sharp diamonds at the front, where there is the hand supporters.The chamber is full of nearly 70 guards all standing at attention on the walls."Sir, but we have a problem...." One of them said."You know....... you guys are fucking tits, just had a moment for my own and you have to start with another problem" atin said back."We are sorry sir, but we think this could be dangerous".Atin looked at them curiously "Why what is it?"."Sir, the mudblood's pet is missing, we searched all over around the castle, but there is no trace of him"."Ah.... It's just a pet, why...."."He is not just a pet sir.... he was the leader of the resistance, who was very tough to get caught, he was nearly successful in killing her"."But he is caught then doesn't he?.... That's what matters, listen i don't have time to get scared alright?"."Afterall what could a mudblood's pet could do against us?" he said laughing.He turned around, got on the stairs of the throne walked upwards and sat on it, kissing the big diamond at the hand supporter once, leaned back and sighed.His two guards looked at each other and gone outside taking his leave.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"I should have never said OK to this". The general said."Well, we are here now, you can't just go turn around and go back now do you?" ron retorted back.Ron, dean, seamus, the general along with two of the resistances members are crawling through the castle ventilation, which is connected to a secret path leading to the chamber of the throne. Where other resistance were already waiting."How did you find these, even we don't know these paths here"."Well, thats why we are called resistance you see" seamus said with a smug smile.They reached the place where a path, led to a door with a key hole in it. Now they were walking not crawling, along with the other members.Ron was the first to reach the door, followed by seamus, dean and others standing in the line one by one.Ron looked through the keyhole and saw the throne, more than 100 feet away from the door, the chamber is really big could fit in more than 100 peoples and a young boy sitting in the throne peacefully."Who is it?" ron asked to Seamus in a whisper."Seamus kneeled down and looked through the key hole, his eyes gone wide."The same boy chased us at diagon alley.... what is he doing here?" he asked by an harsh whisper."I don't know, why ask me?..... And what are you afraid of he is just a boy. What can a teenage kid just five or four years younger than could do against us?" he asked smiling."So what do we do now?"  the head death eater asked."We wait for the sound" ron said, they sighed and waited, leaning back on the wall, crossing their hands across their chest.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Hermione really don't have a plan in her head, she was just going with the flow. Having made into a bride's gown and all.Riddle and her is standing before a dark wizard, who is going to bond them for lifetime.The ceremony hall, was filled with famous celebrities and other dark lord followers, attending the famous bonding function of the dark lord and the dark witch, 'The marriage of the god and the goddess' as elegantly put by the daily prophet.Some of them had their own suggestions against this, a pureblood wizard especially the dark lord marrying a muggle born.... well it is not acceptable.But was accepted as she is the dark witch."Do you like to be bonded with the witch here for your lifetime my lord?"."Yes....I do"."Do you like to be bonded with the dark lord here ms.hermione" he asked and she looked at riddle, quickly thinking some plans to get him alone."Yes....I do".Even though he knew occulumency, he can't invade her mind as she knows how to block it."Alright then, you are both are bonded to your entire life time to spent your life together, sharing all your sadness, happiness and magic together" he said and whispered something in an ancient language which only hermione understood as she knows now all the language that ever existed on the planet.As soon as the magic was pronounced they were bonded, there magic from where the death marks are present, a big black line of smoke emerged and turned riddle magic into gold and her magic into silver, they gone up and started to bind with one another.The photos clicking, an unseen binding happens for the first time in history where the magic took colours, showing their powerful spells.Riddle turned towards her, grabbed her head, crashed his lips on her's and kissed her hungrily."You are announced as the king and the queen of terra, the rulers of the planet" the dark wizard announced.Every one clapped and riddle whispered in her ears "The name of my queen is just for show, you are really just be going to my fuck toy here onwards, yeah?" he asked and squeezed her ass.She nodded "Yes, master"Riddle groaned "I like that coming from your pretty mouth hermione, i could just come from you saying that" he said and she smiled.He picked her up in brides style, everyone cheered and he started walking to the dungeons under the palace, with her in his arms to have her as he pleased.

    Tom riddle was walking through a long cold corridor still holding her possessively in the same bride style, the dungeons corridors consists of many number of cells, looking so dull and worst.Each cell has a women chained to the wall naked, some dribbling blood, sobbing, some other women staring at the ceiling blankly and some others laughing at her.They reached the last room, which looked more expensive dungeon cell, she ever saw in her life. It has many candles lit up, consists of a big couch, a king sized bed, lot of books and bath tub sorrounded by scents.He opened the cell as soon as they entered he thrown her at the couch like she was a rag doll and started to tear up her wedding dress."You know hermione..... This whole dungeon was just filled with my Pet's of 5 years and every time I fucked each one of them, i think it is you". He said sliding down her dress from her body and throwing it away leaving her in just a black lace bra and matching lace panties."But, now here you are submitting in front of me, so ready for to open up your juicy pussy to your master for real and i wanted to show you how much I love you. So here is a gift for you, an expensive cell where you going to spend the rest of your life serving your master, the most expensive pet of mine, my sexy pet" he said and started to kiss her, nearly trying to eat her face out, which she reciprocated eagerly back.His hands travelling down to kneed her breasts on top of her bra another hand tracing circles in her inner thighs, making her shiver.He broke the kiss, leaving them both breathless, bring his mouth on her neck, he started sucking and nipping at where her neck and shoulders are joined, she gasped.He teared her bra too and started to twist her high peaked large nipples between her fingers and started sucking at that nipple, while his other hand was trying to crush her another round perfect firm breasts.He brought his fingers and traced a hard line over her panties covered dripping wet cunt."Unghhhhhh....." she moaned and started to writhe."Do you like it hermy.... do you like me sucking your tits or having my hands on your pussy...".She moaned again, biting her lips hard."Say it.... do you like this...."."Ah.....Oh, yes, yes master....I liked it. Please don't stop"."Oh no hermy i never will, i will fuck you till i die, i want no other women, when my sweet mudblood is here" he said and licked on top of her drenched panties tasting her and making her whine."Yes, master....Oh, thank you". He smiled.She was writhing and whining with his ministrations, her panties soaked indicating she was clearly turned on.Suddenly he stopped all his teasing activities at her neck and breasts, slid down her panties too from her legs and thrown it away.Now she was naked, he was enjoying the delicious sight of her bare body. He took hold of her legs and pulled her towards him. Making her lie in the couch with only half of her body on it.He spreaded her legs more and more apart away from each other, making her open her pussy wide open.He attached his open mouth on her glistening cunt and audibly started slurping and thrusting in his tongue, hermione screamed in pleasure.His tongue running along her walls, making her quiver under his mouth, he didn't even let her bring her thighs together around his head, holding her legs spreading it open all the time.His tongue started stroking around her clit, making her whimper in anticipation and he pushed two fingers into her."Master, Please.....Pleaseeeeee..." She moaned pleadingly."Please what, Hermione..... if you want something, then you have to beg for it"."Please..... Please lick my clit"."It's not enough pet, beg more for it" he liked making the famous dark witch beg for pleasure from his lips.Please master, please touch my clit, i want to cum.... your mouth is so good.... Please touch it" she begged miserably and he smiled.He started to stroke her clit gently with his tongue, stroking it at the same speed. His tongue fingers curled inside and hitting the right spot, started to finger fuck her fast and hard.Soon her pussy convulsed, tightly gripping around his fingers tightly, she came hard looking at the ceiling and her mouth parting in silent scream, her toned thighs shaking violently. He slowed down the speed of his fingers fucking her.She came down slowly and sighed, he then again did it and made her come for the second time.After that, he stood started to undress himself, showing her his toned stomach, firm chest, muscles biceps and thighs. His erect cock straining in his boxers and he slowly stripped it.His cock was long and thick, looking like a thick white snake standing firmly between his legs pointing at her.She took hold of his cock quickly "I want to pleasure you master, please.... let me give you what you want" she begged like a child, pouting her lips.He laughed "it's for you hermione, my dick is only for you to take care here after".She pointed to the king sized bed in the centre of the bed, he picked her up her like a child and walked over to the bed.He put her at the bed unceremoniously and started to crawl on top her, but she stopped him and pushed him on his back.He arched an eyebrow at her taking control, but she kissed him hungrily at his lips, he moaned and fall back on his back.She slowly starrdled him, sliding on top of him.Her greedy pussy enveloping his white snake, firmly.He groaned loudly at the feeling of her cunt for the first time so wet, so tight..... and only his from now on.She slid slowly down taking him fully into that greedy pussy until it hit at her hilt.He moaned disappointedly at the loss of heat, she again slid him in, started to ride him leisurely killing him at slow speed.She bent down and kissed him, he moaned and tried hard to speed up the movements to thrust up into her.She wouldn't allow him, stopping him, taking control. But he liked this, her taking control making her go wild.Soon she again was coming, gripping him tightly and bathing his crotch at her juices.His eyes rolled to the back of his head in obvious pleasure.He was so gone into the lust filled pleasurable daze, so he didn't notice her touching his face, conjuring a knife and marking an invisible symbol at his forehead.She started to ride him faster, bouncing up and down, her boobs bouncing, fat ass shaking with the impact of skin on skin slapping each other.At the same time, she was whispering the same sort of language the dark wizard pronounced while they were being bond.He was so close to release, that's when it happened, the blood symbol on his forehead and their newly bonded symbol at both of their forehand glowing brightly.His eyes covered black, but not with lust, the dark magic inside him trying to get out, he looked at her, who was looking at him with a smug smile.This was all her idea, a plan. A black smoke from his eyes, nose and the symbol started slowly transforming to her eyes and noes, where she was breathing it in. Suddenly he know what she did.It's the old magic, which was banned in even between the death eaters. The taking of the evil power of another wizard, by killing them with a special symbol, so that their magic will get transformed to the one that his bonded to him.Which when travelled into you, will make your evil self overshadow your good qualities but you are still you, more a bad version of yourself.He tried to get up, push her from him, but before he could, his body started bubbling like he took a polyjuice potion.Hermione was all the while smiling at him, as her plan actually worked, the old magic making her evil self more prominent.The powers she was getting from dark lord making her feel more powerful, evil and dark, flowing through her body and with the movement inside her she know it hit the life growing inside her womb and then she realised her and Ron's baby will have the combined strong power of her and the dark lord.Her eyes started to become full black, where as the dark Lord's handsome face of tom riddle changing into voldemorts noseless ugly face.Soon she felt stronger and he started to practically break his body getting broke here and there like glasses.His solid version inch by inch getting broken into ashes.She could feel his cock losing it's solid form and getting changed into ashes.Soon she was sitting naked on the bed, which is covered with ashes. Her eyes full of black and smug smile.She ringed a bell, that was with him..... that will summon the guards.Soon she got up and waved her hands z she was dressed as her old self, black slit dress, which showed her thighs.Two guards came running outside and looked into the cell, their eyes went wide with fear and ran to where they just came from.Inside there is only ashes in the bed, she was slowly making her way to the gate, looking like a ghost, eyes were so dark, there is no more white in it, like so dark.The guards started whistling, suddenly the palace alarm was ringing..........

    This chapter is more with action, where fight take over both places simultaneously, so the scenes changes from one place to another.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Atin was in his nice peaceful slumber, sitting in the throne dreaming of his own kingdom, later the one to sit in the throne of terra.He was suddenly woken up by the alarm ringing throughout the castle."Sir, the prisoners they are getting out, their cells are broken and they have their wands with them"."What?!!....How?"."We don't know sir, they started attacking everyone one of us, i think you should come ther......(cough)".Suddenly small black balls were flew in through the gaps between the floors and the closed doors, the chamber was filled with black smoke, no one could see anything, except only black.He heard many footsteps running and someone screaming the locking charm (which only can be rescasted by the same person's magic or else you have to broke the door manually without magic) and the big door of the chamber getting closed.The smoke slowly started getting cleared and there stood hundreds of her death eaters army with hundreds of his.The chamber was filled with death eaters, raising their weapons at each other and with the sound going outside the door, probably they all already started the fights.Straight a 100 feet away from him stood a muscular tall guy, maybe two or three years older than him with red hair which brightly stood out of all the others.He seemed like the head of the others now, as all of them are watching him like waiting for his orders.
But who is he, atin never seen him before, but the others he seen some in diagon alley with draco malfoy.Suddenly the red head looked like he is going to make a move and it was the same time where he screamed "Attack" and Atin ordered "kill 'em" in unison. Then the fight started.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~She waved her hand and her cell burst open with the iron gates flying and smashing with the opposite wall.The corridor full of guards are waiting with pointing their wands at her and she slowly walked out eyes full of black an evilness radiating from her.Watching them she snapped her fingers, suddenly two of the guards in the front fell down to the floor headless, their heads burst open and blood splattering to the other death eaters faces.They were now a pack simply backing away through the corridor looking scared, some of the last ones running to escape, some throwing curses at her which she easily shielded with using just her hand.The guards started running off, but she grabbed a handfull of air and crushed it, but it actually took effect on the soldiers as the last 10 of them exploaded their blood and organs splattering.She laughed, how much she liked testing this power on them, how much she liked hearing their screaming scared, how much she enjoyed feeling their fear, how much she enjoyed seeing their blood.She reached to the end of the corridor and made an x movement with her hands.Soon all the dungeon cells burst open like a bombarda maxima was casted on it, the Pet's of him, free of the broken chain, which are all fell to the floor, started running to escape out of the palace.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Ron was seriously scared.He didn't expected to fight in a chamber like a bloody arsenal no way to escape until only one of these many lives.He just planned to release the prisoners and get him with some of the death eaters to take their head out, so he could bring the castle under his control.But he didn't know who the bloody hell closed the doors with that damn spell.The boy whose name was Atin as seamus said was 100 feet straight away from him, but was getting closed.Ron never felt scared fighting of the opponent, but now the boy is making him a little scared.Because he is not just fighting whoever comes in front of him (even his own guards) he is practically killing them, hunting them like animals is more of a word.Grabbing their necks, biting their throat and tearing their skin with the organs with his teeth, taking his wand and pressing it into their eye balls, cruelly casting unforgivable curses all over and ducking perfectly when the curses was turned on him. He doesn't just look like a teen boy, he looked like he fought so many before, like had so many experience in fighting, especially cruel killing.And the important reason for him getting scared is the boy only had eyes for him all the while killing others, glaring at him looking straight to his eyes.Whoever is getting killed by him, ron seriously took pity on them, not a nice way to go and he knows eventually he will fight with the boy, because he is making his way towards ron, fighting everyone on the way.The chamber is full of his resistance fighting combined with her army and opposite side, everyone killing everyone, like animals fighting for survival.Seriously it looked like all hell broke loose.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~She was now headed to the main hall of the palace, searching for each one of them she already killed nearly thousands of them, with her wandeless magic cruelly.The palace was shaking with her letting out her powers. A part of the palace consisted of the dungeons and some others, collapsed to the ground already.Just as she was entering the dinning room, all the entry way was blocked by hundreds of soldiers pointing wands at her and their fears smelled Delicious to her.She flicked her whole hand and all of them bursted. She now started to destroy the whole palace, making it collapse all over.She reached the dark Lord's chamber and there it is, the golden throne.
'The throne of Terra'.She walked over to it and tentativily touched the arm of the throne at first and then greedily.Suddenly she could feel a fear radiating from someone, she turned and blocked the killing curse which was just mere inches from hitting her.She looked at the one who casted it, it was tumas, the loyal servant to the ruler of the throne.She walked over to him, grabbed his neck and started squeezing it, he couldn't even move a finger, only able move his face, he is gasping for air, not able to breathe properly or even to stop her, controlled by her magic.She took her hand and he fell to the floor panting heavily.She smiled "Ring the bell to the world tumas, tomorrow's dawn will arive with your new ruler. There is no more dark lord, only the dark witch". She said pointing at the throne and herself.Tumas looked at her schoked, nodded and bowed his head, she walked away to the fire place, in the half collapsed palace.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The castle was a replication of the battle of hogwarts, whole castle filled with fights, bodies and blood.Dark Lord's army fighting for atin and Hermione's army fighting for ron.Everyone death eaters fighting against every death eaters, just puppets of ron and atin, killing each other for survival.The entry way, the dungeons, the prisons, even the forest they were hunting each other, everyone one of them using magic or hands, to kill. Everyone bathed in blood, not even able to escape as apparating is not an option.Inside the chamber atin was so eager to get to the red head, to beat him to death and show he is the superior.He don't know, why he felt this way, he never experienced this much force or rage, he felt like he is in his best form.Maybe because the guy looked like he spent all his life in war, with the way of fighting, fighting pairs and pairs of death eaters at the same time, impaling their own wands to their hearts and killing the others just with hands, punching them to death.They were just few feet away and he wanted him to desperately look at him killing his men, to show the superiority, to see some expressions on his face.That's when he caught the expression changing in the red heads face, eyes going wide, forehead creased in worry, looking at someone he was holding.Atin looked who he was holding by the neck and it was one of the guy he fought at the diagon alley.He enjoyed getting some reaction out of the red head, so he took his wand out, thrusted it into the guys eyeballs and he just died on the spot, body going limp. The red head shouted "Dean!!" Along with some another guy, across the room near the wall fighting two death eaters. His eyes were filled with tears and moaned "Noooo....".Atin drop him dead down and turned around to smile at the red head.He was getting hold by four death, but soon fought them off by lifting one and breaking his back bone by thrashing him on his knees, atin could hear the bone breaking few feet away.The red head face filled with so much rage, started killed the others with killing curse and started to run at him.Atin too ran straight towards him, two of them running straight to each other in rage enough to kill the other one.Both of them gave the other a hard blow to the face as sooniyam as they reached near, making each other fell down.Atin stood fast and lifted ron, gave a hard punch to his chest where his heart would be. Trying to stop his heart just with the hard punches, he hit the spot again and again.Ron groaned in pain and grabbed atins hand, twisting it to the back he have a hard punch to the boys elbow. Atin screamed in pain and fell down.Ron picked him up and thrown him across, where he fell down to the steps of the throne.Ron ran towards him to make the next punch, but before that atin twisted his legs between the red head's legs and made him fell down.Atin starddled ron and repeatedly started punching his face, each punch obtaining blood.Ron pushed him back and folded atins legs backside and chocking his neck with elbow, which made atin gasping for air, he made his hands go back and poked his right eye with his thumb.Ron screamed and rubbed at his eyes, losing control over the hold, atin stood and twisted Ron's leg and kicked his knee.Ron took his wand to kill him, but atin grabbed it and threw the wand away, he started using his method of killing the vigorous werewolves on ron.Beating him continuously and trying to stab his face with his sharp wand, but ron escapes each time.The room was full of dead bodies, blood and only four pair fighting, seamus with a death eater, the general with atins general, two death eaters with each other and ron with atin.Ron was nearly fainting, when one of the two death eaters who were fighting near the last, casted a exploding spell, but it accidenlty hit the throne, the arm of the throne exploded and the big diamond which atin kissed at first flew down near to the hands of ron.Ron desperate to escape the hold and death puches of the psychic boy, took the diamond and hit it hard across atins face, half of face nearly broke, atin grabbed his face, only hearing a buzzing in his ears.He again lunged at ron, but ron punched him again hard, made atin lie on the floor.Ron stardled him and started hitting his face and neck by dropping the big diamond again and again on him.Atin remembered the same method he used to kill Draco malfoy with a stone.Seamus who just finished killing, looked around the chamber the boys who fought with them all are dead along with the death eater armies, all sacrificed, his eyes wide when he saw ron straddling and thrashing the boy's face with a big hard diamond, both of them covered in blood. He never saw ron with this much anger, his eyes were so red with rage and unshed tears. He thought of stopping it but it was right to do for dean, his unrelated brother.Atin nearly fainted with the force of the hits, ron stood and kept the diamonds sharp side at the boy's neck and pressed it hard with his feet.Atin trying to get his legs away, trying to take in air, because the sharp side of the diamond starting to cut his throat and he his losing his strength to defend with the loss of air to breath.Finally ron grabbed atins hair and with all the strength pulled his head outwards, away from his head. Severing the head.He took a tight hold of the head and walked up the stairs, turned around and sat on the broken throne, one of his eblows resting on his one knee, blood all over his body still clutching the head tightly which dripping blood all over the floor.Seamus heard a sound of someone fall to the ground and looked back, the general killed atins head general. He sighed happily and said "We won" and smiled."Yeah..... we did" seamus said, pointed his wand at the general and killing him.He walked over to stand in front of ron, looking around feeling sad with all of them he once considered brothers lying on the floor lifeless."So. What now?" he asked ron."Now......(sighs)......we wait for her" he said looking and pointing to the fireplace in the chamber.

    Chapter Text
    As soon as she stepped in through the fire place, it exploaded like it bursted by explosives.She looked around her, she expected the place to be the living room.But where she is standing is her chamber which is full of dead bodies and blood river, the door closed. There is no sound, only silence remained at the castle.She tried to use homenum revelio and spells that could open the door using wandless magic, but nothing worked.Looking around she found ron, who looked like bathed in blood, sitting in her throne, which is very much broken, holding a head.Seamus finnigan sitting in the steps of her throne, both of them smiling at her."Welcome, your highness, welcome to the end of your life" seamus said, both of them still smiling at her."Your magic won't work here.....A good old dark magic by my bonded blood to stop you"."Ron, what is happening?" she continued "What happened here?"."Well.... What does it look like to you?" he asked back."It looks like a war happened here, who killed them all?"."Me..... Killing them all, giving them all a happy send off, just waiting for you to give yours".She realized the meaning of his words "Are you going to kill me ronald..... you think you can?"."Well..... let try shall we?" seamus said and ron suddenly shouted "Crucio".Suddenly she was lying on the floor writhing and screaming her body felt like she is lying on a bed of fire.He screamed again, pointing his wand at her "Crucio".Her bones ready to burst into million pieces, the world around her started to fade."Crucio" he said, his eyes were full of rage, some sort of blackness surrounding him.Her memory remembering looking up at the ceiling of malfoy manor, while being tortured by the hands of bellatrix, a only hope was the voice of ron."Crucio" he said with full force.She screamed, not able to take the pain any more, desperately wanted to try something to stop him.Seamus was trying hard not to urge ron to just kill her, get it over with, but then her soldiers started to hit the chamber doors with big tree, desperately to open it and save their empress.He screamed "Ron, just do it..... come on, kill her. They will get in quickly".Ron was trying hard not to notice some sort of attachment feelings from the their bond and was getting ready to kill her, once and for all.Suddenly the black magic she newly acquired, escaping from her, a black smoke emitting from her eyes and the dark mark around her.It slowly travelling to the only person who is bonded to her, Ron.Ron wanted her to feel the pain...... the pain of everything she took away from him.A large smoke of blackness sorrunded her, but made their way towards him, quickly getting into his eyes and his dark mark. His wand fell down to the floor. Their minds getting connected seeing the same visions through their minds.At the same time the chamber doors opened and hundreds of death eaters ran in both her and the dark Lord's (as she killed him they are under her control now) some caught seamus, others surrounded the whole room pointing their wands at a ron who closed his eyes and half floating in air by the darkness surrounding him and Hermione who was lying, writhing on the floor also surrounded by the same darkness.Ron's mind suddenly went black like falling into a pensive, a small bright light coming towards him.Then the scenes of his past hit him with the same feelings.Seeing her with krum at the yule ball, how he thought he lost her to the other guy, he could have been the one to dance with her.Seeing her after getting from his death bed in sixth year and how he was relieved by seeing her again, where he thought he will die not even talking to her once.How he desperately tried to find her and never leave her, after leaving them on horcrux hunt.How he cried and felt like he was dead, by the torture of hermione screaming in pain on the cold floor of malfoy manor.Slow tears started to fall down his cheeks and  he heard a heartbeat, a small heartbeat with small pulse and a crying, a crying of small child.He remembered of helen and their dream of small, happy family with their child... Smiling and playing with them in a world of no more darkness.A dream where there is everyone who he loved surrounding them, helen replaced with the beautiful smiling face of Hermione, holding a red head baby of theirs, they sitting at the weasley dinner, his siblings and their spouses, his mum and dad smiling at them and taking to their grandkids, atlast across from them harry and Ginny, kissing each other and looked at them smiling happily. Ron turned towards Hermione who was holding his baby and getting close to kiss her, suddenly he was her, lying on the floor.He could sense her, like he was her and a life inside him, his same blood...... His baby.His love for her since the moment he met her never faded, but now doubled by the baby.He let out the tears, he was holding, tears falling down..... the magic slowly dropping him to the floor, he stood on the steps of the throne.Suddenly the black magic, reversed its way from where it came.... going back into hermione.She sat and started crawling towards ron, reaching him she stood slowly, touching his shoulders and rounding to stand behind him.One hand at his forehead and other at his chest, She said "Raise away ron..... raise away before this whole world, our new kingdom.... to our life"."Bow before your king" She shouted and all the death eaters surrounding them, bowed and kneeled simultaneously.Seamus looked around unsure what to do, but after her glare turned towards him, he too took the other's same position.They all could feel an evilness, a dark power radiating from the couple and finally ron looked up and smiled.He is still ron, but looked powerful, his dark mark glowing, an evil look on his face.His eyes looked..... Different, not the shade of red from moments ago, it has changed.... his eyes are......His eyes were 'black'.(End)
